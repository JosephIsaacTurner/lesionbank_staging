16542786,Rapid recovery from major depression using magnesium treatment.,"Eby, George A; Eby, Karen L",Eby,"Major depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sense of inadequacy, despondency, decreased activity, pessimism, anhedonia and sadness where these symptoms severely disrupt and adversely affect the person's life, sometimes to such an extent that suicide is attempted or results. Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.047,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 26-year-old man with bipolar disorder, seizures, and mild mental retardation secondary to a traumatic brain injury began treatment with carbamazepine for aggression and seizure control. After three weeks of carbamazepine therapy, the patient arrived at the emergency department (ED) with severe agitation and aggressive behavior. His oral medications included topiramate, carbamazepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, guanfacine, and desmopressin acetate. The patient's medications had been stable for at least six months except for the addition of carbamazepine one month before his arrival at the ED. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were found to be within normal limits, as were his liver profile results, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating-hormone level, and serum chemistry panel. His serum carbamazepine concentration was 3.9 microg/mL (reference range, 4-12 microg/mL), and his serum ammonia concentration was 127 microg/dL (reference range, 19-60 microg/dL). Carbamazepine was discontinued upon admission, and the patient was treated with oral lactulose. Since carbamazepine was discontinued and had been prescribed for bipolar disorder, his olanzapine dosage was increased, and trazodone was added at bedtime for insomnia. Of note, the patient had been on carbamazepine therapy one year earlier and had experienced the same adverse event. He had also developed elevated serum ammonia levels while on valproic acid. The patient's serum ammonia level returned to normal by hospital day 4, and he was discharged to his group home.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and should be considered in all TIA and stroke patients. Sleep disorders can amplify nociception and worsen headache disorders; and some headaches, including those related to SDB and hypnic headache, are sleep specific. REM sleep behavior disorder may be an early sign of neurodegenerative disease. Focal lesions of almost any etiology (eg, multiple sclerosis and CNS malignancies) in the hypothalamus, basal forebrain, or brainstem may result in sleep disturbance, sleepiness, and insomnia. Sleep-related hypoventilation and fatigue are common in neuromuscular disease. SDB and epilepsy are mutually facilitatory, and poor sleep can exacerbate epilepsy.

37274664,Persistent hiccups following thalamic hemorrhage: A case report.,"Shivkumar, Vikram; Nemade, Dipali; Dhingra, Neelu",Shivkumar,"Persistent hiccups (lasting more than 48 hours) can cause physical and emotional distress. They can result in dehydration, exhaustion, malnutrition, insomnia, wound dehiscence, ventilatory desynchronization, and hemodynamic changes. Hiccups are thought to be due to a complex reflex arc involving peripheral nerves and central structures such as the brainstem, temporal lobe, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and spinal cord levels C3-5. Medullary strokes, for instance, have been reported to cause hiccups. We report a patient with a thalamic bleed who developed persistent hiccups. A 56-year-old man was brought to the hospital in an unresponsive state. He was intubated for airway protection. CT brain showed a left thalamic hemorrhage with edema and mass effect on the 3rd ventricle, intraventricular extension of hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus. An external ventricular drain was placed successfully with adequate drainage. One week after admission, the patient developed persistent abdominal jerks. These jerks were occurring every 3-4 seconds and would last for hours with brief periods of remission. He was started on levetiracetam 1000 mg IV bid and then increased to 1500 mg IV BID without any improvement of symptoms. The patient was also placed on EEG which did not reveal any epileptiform abnormality but did show an EMG artifact. His electrolytes including sodium, and potassium, and corrected calcium levels were normal. He did not have any evidence of pneumonia or other infections. It was determined that these jerks were likely hiccups. Metoclopramide 10 mg IV was tried without any benefit. He was then started on Baclofen 10 mg PO TID which resulted in a significant improvement in hiccups. Our case suggests that thalamic lesions might also lead to persistent hiccups.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Heliyon,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16409,PMC10238684,Hiccups; Stroke; Thalamus,Case Reports,England,eng
32560097,Psychiatric Manifestation of Anti-LGI1 Encephalitis.,"Endres, Dominique; Prüss, Harald; Dressing, Andrea; Schneider, Johanna; Feige, Bernd; Schweizer, Tina; Venhoff, Nils; Nickel, Kathrin; Meixensberger, Sophie; Matysik, Miriam; Maier, Simon J; Domschke, Katharina; Urbach, Horst; Meyer, Philipp T; Tebartz van Elst, Ludger",Endres,"Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is typically characterized by limbic encephalitis, faciobrachial dystonic seizures and hyponatremia. The frequency with which milder forms of anti-LGI1 encephalitis mimic isolated psychiatric syndromes, such as psychoses, or may lead to dementia if untreated, is largely unknown. Here, the authors present a 50-year-old patient who had suffered from neurocognitive deficits and predominant delusions for over one and a half years. He reported a pronounced feeling of thirst, although he was drinking 10-20 liters of water each day, and he was absolutely convinced that he would die of thirst. Due to insomnia in the last five years, the patient took Z-drugs; later, he also abused alcohol. Two years prior to admission, he developed a status epilepticus which had been interpreted as a withdrawal seizure. In his serum, anti-LGI1 antibodies were repeatedly detected by different independent laboratories. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses revealed slightly increased white blood cell counts and evidence for blood-brain-barrier dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities mesio-temporally and in the right amygdala. In addition, there was a slight grey-white matter blurring. A cerebral [<sup>18</sup>F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) examination of his brain showed moderate hypometabolism of the bilateral rostral mesial to medial frontal cortices. Treatment attempts with various psychotropic drugs remained unsuccessful in terms of symptom relief. After the diagnosis of probable chronified anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made, two glucocorticoid pulse treatments were performed, which led to a slight improvement of mood and neurocognitive deficits. Further therapy was not desired by the patient and his legally authorized parents. This case study describes a patient with anti-LGI1 encephalitis in the chronified stage and a predominant long-lasting psychiatric course with atypical symptoms of psychosis and typical neurocognitive deficits. The patient's poor response to anti-inflammatory drugs was probably due to the delayed start of treatment. This delay in diagnosis and treatment may also have led to the FDG-PET findings, which were compatible with frontotemporal dementia (""state of damage""). In similar future cases, newly occurring epileptic seizures associated with psychiatric symptoms should trigger investigations for possible autoimmune encephalitis, even in patients with addiction or other pre-existing psychiatric conditions. This should in turn result in rapid organic clarification and-in positive cases-to anti-inflammatory treatment. Early treatment of anti-LGI1 encephalitis during the ""inflammatory activity state"" is crucial for overall prognosis and may avoid the development of dementia in some cases. Based on this case, the authors advocate the concept-long established in many chronic inflammatory diseases in rheumatology-of distinguishing between an ""acute inflammatory state"" and a ""state of organ damage"" in autoimmune psychosis resembling neurodegenerative mechanisms.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci10060375,PMC7348933,anti-LGI1 encephalitis; autoimmune psychosis; limbic encephalitis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

1435659,The postconcussion syndrome and the sequelae of mild head injury.,"Evans, R W",Evans,"The postconcussion syndrome refers to a large number of symptoms and signs that may occur alone or in combination following usually mild head injury. The most common complaints are headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, loss of consciousness and memory, and noise sensitivity. Mild head injury is a major public health concern because the annual incidence is about 150 per 100,000 population, accounting for 75% or more of all head injuries. The postconcussion syndrome has been recognized for at least the last few hundred years and has been the subject of intense controversy for more than 100 years. The Hollywood head injury myth has been an important contributor to persisting skepticism and might be countered by educational efforts and counter-examples from boxing. The organicity of the postconcussion syndrome has now become well documented. Abnormalities following mild head injury have been reported in neuropathologic, neurophysiologic, neuroimaging, and neuropsychologic studies. There are multiple sequelae of mild head injury, including headaches of multiple types, cranial nerve symptoms and signs, psychologic and somatic complaints, and cognitive impairment. Rare sequelae include hematomas, seizures, transient global amnesia, tremor, and dystonia. Neuroimaging and physiologic and psychologic testing should be used judiciously based on the problems of the particular patient rather than in a cookbook fashion. Prognostic studies clearly substantiate the existence of a postconcussion syndrome. Manifestations of the postconcussion syndrome are common, with resolution in most patients by 3 to 6 months after the injury. Persistent symptoms and cognitive deficits are present in a distinct minority of patients for additional months or years. Risk factors for persisting sequelae include age over 40 years; lower educational, intellectual, and socioeconomic level; female gender; alcohol abuse; prior head injury; and multiple trauma. Although a small minority are malingerers, frauds, or have compensation neurosis, most patients have genuine complaints. Contrary to a popular perception, most patients with litigation or compensation claims are not cured by a verdict. Treatment is individualized depending on the specific complaints of the patient. Although a variety of medication and psychologic treatments are currently available, ongoing basic and clinical research of all aspects of mild head injury are crucial to provide more efficacious treatment in the future.",{},,Neurologic clinics,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

MRI shows an intracranial mass, 33÷24÷30 mm in size, localized at the level of third ventricle and lateral ventricles, with irregular shape, interesting the foramen of Monroe. There are also nodular areas of calcification and a supratentorial hydrocephalus involving the lateral ventricles and the posterior part of the third ventricle.

31991060,Limbic encephalitis associated with AMPA receptor and CRMP5 antibodies: A case report and literature review.,"Jia, Yujuan; Wang, Jie; Xue, Lanping; Hou, Yuli",Jia,"AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and CRMP5 antibodies are relatively uncommon in limbic encephalitis, and patients with both antibodies are rare. We recently treated such a patient, but the patient died after active treatment. To further understand this disease, we conducted a case report and literature review. To date, five encephalitis patients, including our patient, have been found to be positive for AMPAR and CRMP5 antibodies. The male-to-female ratio of the reported cases is 4:1, and the age range is 26 and 62 years old. All five patients presented with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including insomnia, abnormal behavior, seizures, extrapyramidal symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction. Four patients had tumors (three invasive thymomas and one suspected lymphoma), and three cases died within a short period of time. No tumor was detected in one of the patients during the follow-up period; however, after active treatment, the outcome was poor, and the patient developed cachexia. One patient had good response to immunotherapy and tumor therapy and successfully returned to work. The prognosis of encephalitis associated with AMPAR and CRMP5 antibodies is worse than that of the encephalitis associated with AMPAR antibodies alone. The most likely cause is that this encephalitis is more likely to be accompanied by malignant tumors, leading to a poor prognosis. In addition, it may also be due to some synergistic mechanisms between the two antibodies. Further studies aimed at the prognosis of this type of encephalitis are warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.1528,PMC7066334,AMPAR; CRMP5; antibodies; limbic encephalitis; malignant tumor,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

He was initially managed for acute psychosis without any improvement. Further workup for organic causes revealed positive NMDAR antibodies in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, confirming a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. His condition later improved with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. This case signifies the importance of ruling out organic causes in patients with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms.

A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more. The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out. General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately.

3898769,The social environment and neurological disease.,"Grant, I",Grant,"This chapter has reviewed some of the methodological and theoretical issues in research linking the social environment to medical illnesses. The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.",{},,Advances in psychosomatic medicine,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",Switzerland,eng

These cases are rare, often unilateral, and because of the usually transitory duration of symptoms, often under-recognized. When a treatment is required, it can be tricky and the drug choice not foregone. We report 2 patients with unilateral poststroke PLM with similar clinical pictures but different symptoms, therapy, and outcome. The first is a long-lasting unilateral PLM video case with chronic vascular lesions leading to insomnia even if with no urgence or any subjective symptoms as in RLS but well responding only to a definite RLS treatment. The second case is an acute, short-duration self-limiting PLM with positive brain MRI lesion imaging. Our cases suggest that unilateral poststroke PLM even if distinct in subjective and radiological features from secondary RLS can sometimes have a definite and effective dopaminergic treatment if long-lasting. Putative mechanism of chronic case 1 PLM could be due to a further stroke sparing sensory pathways and making the patient unaware of subjective RLS-like symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000522334,PMC9035910,Magnetic resonance imaging; Movement disorders; Restless legs syndrome; Stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Clinically, it can have an acute to sub-acute onset of confusion and cognitive impairment, facial-brachial dystonic seizures (FDBS), and psychiatric disturbances. The clinical manifestations are varied, and its diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to avoid delay in the treatment. When patients manifest mostly psychiatric symptoms, the disease may not be immediately recognized. We aim to report a case of Anti-LGI 1 LE in which the patient presented acute psychotic symptoms and was initially diagnosed with unspecified psychosis. We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids and immunoglobulin and later with IV rituximab. In patients that predominantly present with psychotic and cognitive disorders the diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE can be delayed predisposing them to a poorer prognosis (permanent cognitive impairment - especially short-term memory loss - and persistent seizures). It is necessary to be aware of this diagnosis when evaluating acute to sub-acute psychiatric illness developing with cognitive impairment (specially with memory loss) to avoid diagnosis delays and long-term sequelae.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.36223,PMC10105494,anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 limbic encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; liaison psychiatry; limbic encephalitis; psychosis,Case Reports,United States,eng

During hospitalization, the patient experienced a progression-free course. Upon awakening on day 26 after hospitalization, the patient suddenly showed signs of mania. The symptoms included elevated mood, pressured speech, hyperactivity, insomnia, and agitation; these symptoms caused problems in his daily life at the hospital. On day 29 after hospitalization, the patient was referred to a psychiatric hospital as an outpatient. He was diagnosed with organic manic disorder and was hospitalized. The patient was administered lithium carbonate (Limas<sup>®</sup>; 400 mg daily) and risperidone (Risperdal<sup>®</sup>; 2 mg daily).

He was able to undergo rehabilitation without any problem and with no exacerbation of mania. The patient was discharged on day 139 after readmission. In cases where patients with cerebrovascular disorders display abnormal behavior, it becomes necessary to differentiate between secondary mania and social behavior disorder.

34573258,A Diagnostic Dilemma of White Matter Lesions and Cerebral Oedema without Identifiable Cause-A Neurological Conundrum.,"Goire, Namraj; Buckland, Michael; Cuganesan, Ramesh; Saleem, Sameer; Lea, Vivienne; Beran, Roy G",Goire,"This paper describes a case of bi-frontal vasogenic oedema associated with bilateral frontal lobe and left parietal lobe white matter lesions where extensive investigations, including brain biopsy, failed to establish a diagnosis. A 67-year-old female presented with three weeks' history of memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and occasional dysphasia. Physical examination was unremarkable, yet cerebral CT and MRI showed bilateral frontal lobe vasogenic oedema. Extensive investigations, including: biochemical; radiological; immunological; microbiological; haematological; histopathological; and cytological, failed to establish a confirmed diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team could not achieve a consensus for this atypical presentation. Brain biopsy was unusual, showing destructive inflammatory and subtly granulomatous disease, but an exhaustive list of auxiliary tests could not confirm a cause, and consensus favoured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune encephalopathy. A definitive diagnosis could not be established for this patient despite a gamut of investigations. Although some of the presenting features were consistent with GFAP astrocytopathy, initial staining of the patient's CSF for neuronal antibodies was negative. Her symptoms and radiological changes of brain imaging improved without any corticosteroid therapy. Through this case report, the aim is to add to the repository of neurological sciences in the hope that future similar presentations could potentially lead to discovery of a new aetiology or contribute towards better understanding of an existing disease process.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci11091238,PMC8467850,amnesia; cerebral oedema; diagnostic dilemma; neurohistophathology; white matter lesions,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
38581805,Reversible dementia and insomnia in ABGA related encephalitis.,"Mumoli, Laura; Magro, Giuseppe; Le Piane, Emilio; Bosco, Domenico",Mumoli,"ABGAs are historically associated with Encephalitis Lethargica (EL). Typically ABGAs are also found in children resulting in a variety of neuropsychiatric and extrapyramidal disorders, rare cases are reported in adults with atypical movement disorders. No description of basal ganglia reversible lesions related to ABGAs are reported and these antibodies are not included in the list of autoimmune encephalitis. A 55 years old female presented sub-acute onset of an anxious-depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive behavior associated with intractable insomnia affecting sleep onset and sleep maintenance. Brain-MRI showed diffuse hyperintensities on FLAIR sequences in the basal ganglia. A therapy with IV-immunoglobulin was started and the clinical condition improved dramatically and insomnia and psychiatric symptoms resolved completely. Our case highlights the importance of making a fast diagnosis. When caught early ABGAs-related encephalitis is susceptible of a good outcome and response to treatment. Reversible insomnia and dementia in our case expand ABGA clinical presentation in adults and favors the hypothesis of an immune pathogenesis for Encephalitis Lethargica, especially in the hyperkinetic form as previously suggested, as in our case.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Sleep medicine,10.1016/j.sleep.2024.02.047,,ABGAs; Anti basal ganglia antibodies; Encephalitis; Encephalitis lethargica; Insomnia; Von Economo,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

29870188,Combination of severe facial and cervical vascular malformation with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.,"Faludi, Béla; Imre, Marianna; Büki, András; Komoly, Sámuel; Lujber, László",Faludi,"The combination of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and vascular malformation within the head and neck region is a rare condition, and interestingly, only a few cases have recently been published. Propagation of the vascular mass to the larynx and pharynx can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties. Due to these sypmtoms, examination and initiation of appropriate therapy for such patients are indeed challenging. We reviewed the literature available and present our case of a 64 year old woman emphasizing the complaints of sleep apnea syndrome and vascular malformation of the face and neck region. Polygraphic examination detected severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The MR examination of the neck revealed extensive vascular mass narrowing the pharyngo-laryngeal region, thereby causing temporal bone destruction on the right side with intracranial propagation. ENT examination demonstrated significant narrowing of the pharyngeal lumen and the laryngeal aditus caused by multiple hemangiomas. CPAP titration showed the minimalization of the apnea-hypopnea index on the effective pressure level. Regular CPAP usage resulted in diminishing a majority of the patient's complaints. Our examination clearly demonstrates, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome coupled with significantly obstructing vascular malformation in the head and neck region can be effectively treated safely with a CPAP device, if surgical therapy is not possible. We summarized our findings and the data available in the literature to set up recommendations for the appropriate examination and therapy (including mask fit, etc.) of vascular malformations and hemangiomas causing pharyngo-laryngeal obstruction.",{},,Ideggyogyaszati szemle,10.18071/isz.70.0007,,CPAP; MR; fluid shift theory; obstructive sleep apnoe syndrome; vascular malformation,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Hungary,eng
32585946,Parkinsonian Syndrome with Frontal Lobe Involvement and Anti-Glycine Receptor Antibodies.,"Endres, Dominique; Prüss, Harald; Rijntjes, Michel; Schweizer, Tina; Werden, Rita; Nickel, Kathrin; Meixensberger, Sophie; Runge, Kimon; Urbach, Horst; Domschke, Katharina; Meyer, Philipp T; Tebartz van Elst, Ludger",Endres,"<i>Background:</i> Atypical Parkinsonian syndromes with prominent frontal lobe involvement can occur in the 4R-taupathies progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Secondary forms of movement disorders may occur in the context of autoimmune encephalitis with antineuronal antibodies, such as anti-glycine receptor (anti-GlyR) antibodies, which are typically associated with Stiff-Person spectrum syndrome, or progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Overlaps between neurodegenerative and immunological mechanisms have been recently suggested in anti-IgLON5 disease. In this case study, the authors describe a patient with a Parkinsonian syndrome with frontal lobe involvement and anti-GlyR antibodies. <i>Case presentation</i>: The patient presented was a 63-year-old female. Her symptoms had begun with insomnia at the age of 60, after which, since the age of 61, increasing personality changes developed, leading to a diagnosis of depression with delusional symptoms. Severe cognitive deficits emerged, along with a left-side accentuated Parkinsonian syndrome with postural instability. The personality changes involved frontal systems. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed low-grade mesencephalon atrophy. [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) depicted a moderate hypometabolism bilateral frontal and of the midbrain, while [<sup>123</sup>I]FPCIT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed severely reduced dopamine transporter availability in both striata, indicating pronounced nigrostriatal degeneration. In addition, anti-GlyR antibodies were repeatedly found in the serum of the patient (max. titer of 1:640, reference: <1:20). Therefore, an anti-inflammatory treatment with steroids and azathioprine was administered; this resulted in a decrease of antibody titers (to 1:80) but no detectable clinical improvement. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and electroencephalography diagnostics showed inconspicuous findings, and negative CSF anti-GlyR antibody results. <i>Conclusion</i>: The patient presented here was suffering from a complex Parkinsonian syndrome with frontal lobe involvement. Because of the high anti-GlyR antibody titers, the presence of an autoimmune cause of the disorder was discussed. However, since no typical signs of autoimmune anti-GlyR antibody syndrome (e.g., hyperexcitability, anti-GlyR antibodies in CSF, or other inflammatory CSF changes) were detected, the possibility that the anti-GlyR antibodies might have been an unrelated bystander should be considered. Alternatively, the anti-GlyR antibodies might have developed secondarily to neurodegeneration (most likely a 4-repeat tauopathy, PSP or CBD) without exerting overt clinical effects, as in cases of anti-IgLON5 encephalopathy. In this case, such antibodies might also potentially modify the clinical course of classical movement disorders. Further research on the role of antineuronal antibodies in Parkinsonian syndromes is needed.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci10060399,PMC7349831,PERM; antibody; frontal dementia; glycine receptor; parkinsonian syndromes; stiff-person syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A 76-year-old man with a history of untreated prostate adenocarcinoma was evaluated for subacute cognitive decline, diffuse muscle cramps, and hyponatremia. MRI demonstrated atrophy most prominent in the frontal and temporal regions. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated diffuse myokymia/neuromyotonia. Polysomnography lacked REM and N3 sleep. Paraneoplastic panel detected antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel complex (CASPR2 subtype). It is difficult to differentiate between Morvan syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia with examination and neuroimaging alone. There may be a link between Morvan syndrome and prostate adenocarcinoma which could help with screening/diagnosis.

9352423,Resolution of sleep paralysis by weak electromagnetic fields in a patient with multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Sleep paralysis refers to episodes of inability to move during the onset of sleep or more commonly upon awakening. Patients often describe the sensation of struggling to move and may experience simultaneous frightening vivid hallucinations and dreams. Sleep paralysis and other manifestations of dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep, which reflect deficient monoaminergic regulation of neural modulators of REM sleep, have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A 40 year old woman with remitting-progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) experienced episodes of sleep paralysis since the age of 16, four years prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Episodes of sleep paralysis, which manifested at a frequency of about once a week, occurred only upon awakening in the morning and were considered by the patient as a most terrifying experience. Periods of mental stress, sleep deprivation, physical fatigue and exacerbation of MS symptoms appeared to enhance the occurrence of sleep paralysis. In July of 1992 the patient began experimental treatment with AC pulsed applications of picotesla intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 5Hz frequency which were applied extracerebrally 1-2 times per week. During the course of treatment with EMFs the patient made a dramatic recovery of symptoms with improvement in vision, mobility, balance, bladder control, fatigue and short term memory. In addition, her baseline pattern reversal visual evoked potential studies, which showed abnormally prolonged latencies in both eyes, normalized 3 weeks after the initiation of magnetic therapy and remained normal more than 2.5 years later. Since the introduction of magnetic therapy episodes of sleep paralysis gradually diminished and abated completely over the past 3 years. This report suggests that MS may be associated with deficient REM sleep inhibitory neural mechanisms leading to sleep paralysis secondary to the intrusion of REM sleep atonia and dream imagery into the waking state. Pineal melatonin and monoaminergic neurons have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of REM sleep and the pathogenesis of sleep paralysis and it is suggested that resolution of sleep paralysis in this patient by AC pulsed applications of EMFs was related to enhancement of melatonin circadian rhythms and cerebral serotoninergic neurotransmission.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459709000634,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Persistent symptoms were self-reported as debilitating, contributing to self-removal from participation in school, work, and leisure activities. Patient and parent interviews captured the history of multiple concussions and other sports-related injuries. Neurological screening and activities of daily living were baseline measured. Post-Concussion Symptom Checklist and Headache Impact Test-6™ were utilized to track symptom severity. Treatments applied included craniosacral therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, and glymphatic techniques. Eleven treatment sessions were administered over 3 months. Results indicated restoration of oxygen saturation, normalized pupil reactivity, and satisfactory sleep. Post-concussion syndrome symptom severity was reduced by 87% as reflected by accumulative Post-Concussion Symptom Checklist scores. Relief from chronic headaches was achieved, reflected by Headache Impact Test-6 scores. Restoration of mood and quality of life were reported. A 6-month follow-up revealed symptoms remained abated with full re-engagement of daily activities. The author hypothesized that post-concussion syndrome symptoms were related to compression of craniosacral system structures and lymphatic fluid stagnation that contributed to head pressure pain, severe sleep deprivation, and multiple neurological and psychological symptoms. Positive outcomes over a relatively short period of time without adverse effects suggest these therapies may offer viable options for the treatment of post-concussion syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,SAGE open medical case reports,10.1177/2050313X20952224,PMC7829464,Post-concussion symptoms (PCS); craniosacral system compression; craniosacral therapy; glymphatic system; interstitium; manual lymphatic drainage; traumatic brain injury (TBI),Case Reports,England,eng

Treatment of ESES is assumed to improve cognitive outcome. The aim of this study is to create an overview of the current evidence for different treatment regimens in children with ESES syndrome. A literature search using PubMed and Embase was performed. Articles were selected that contain original treatment data of patients with ESES syndrome. Authors were contacted for additional information. Individual patient data were collected, coded, and analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The three predefined main outcome measures were improvement in cognitive function, electroencephalography (EEG) pattern, and any improvement (cognition or EEG). The literature search yielded 1,766 articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 112 articles and 950 treatments in 575 patients could be analyzed. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs, n = 495) were associated with improvement (i.e., cognition or EEG) in 49% of patients, benzodiazepines (n = 171) in 68%, and steroids (n = 166) in 81%. Surgery (n = 62) resulted in improvement in 90% of patients. In a subgroup analysis of patients who were consecutively reported (585 treatments in 282 patients), we found improvement in a smaller proportion treated with AEDs (34%), benzodiazepines (59%), and steroids (75%), whereas the improvement percentage after surgery was preserved (93%). Possible predictors of improved outcome were treatment category, normal development before ESES onset, and the absence of structural abnormalities. Although most included studies were small and retrospective and their heterogeneity allowed analysis of only qualitative outcome data, this pooled analysis suggests superior efficacy of steroids and surgery in encephalopathy with ESES.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Epilepsia,10.1111/epi.13128,,Continuous spikes and waves during sleep; Epilepsy; Landau-Kleffner syndrome; Meta-analysis; Systematic review,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Systematic Review",United States,eng

Encephalitis manifested with persistent hiccups, seizures and impairment of consciousness. After 2 weeks, the initial neurologic symptoms subsided and the patient progressively developed movement disorders (rigidity and bradykinesia, resistant to L-DOPA), lethargy and behavioral hypersomnia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thalamic and hippocampal signal abnormalities, immunohistochemistry on a mouse brain substrate revealed serum autoantibodies binding to the brainstem neuropil. Polysomnographic monitoring was consistent with a very severe disruption of sleep: the sleep-wake cycle was fragmented, and the NREM-REM ultradian cycle was irregular. Intravenous immune globulin therapy resulted in the complete reversal of the movement and the sleep disorders. Our observation confirms that parkinsonism and sleep disorders may be consequences of encephalitis, that an immune-mediated pathogenesis is likely, and, consequently, that immunotherapy can be beneficial in these patients. The polysomnographic monitoring suggests that lethargia, rather than a mere hypersomnia, is the result of a combination between sleep disruption and altered motor control.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059416645706,,encephalitis; encephalitis lethargica; hypersomnia; immunoglobuline; polysomnography; post-encephalitic parkinsonism; sleep,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report a patient who was admitted to the hospital with anxiety and depressive disorder and was eventually diagnosed with REP. A 48-year-old patient who had undergone over 2 years of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma was admitted to the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine of our hospital because of recurrent fear, low mood, and waking up from dreams. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the left temporal lobe with a large peripheral edema. After multidisciplinary consultation, the possibility of tumor recurrence could not be excluded. Resection of the lesioned brain tissue to obtain pathological tissue showed glial cell proliferation and small focal areas of degeneration and necrosis, which indicated that the lesions were inflammatory. Postoperative MRI showed no abnormal signal, and the patient's condition improved.

Symptoms are improved by movement. Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Lesion-related RLS has been reported, mainly in cases of stroke-related RLS involving the brainstem and lenticulostriate nuclei. Only few data of RLS in a context of spinal cord injury have been reported. We report the case of a woman with secondary RLS due to hemorrhage of a spinal cord cavernoma located at T9-T10. Following recovery from the acute phase of the hemorrhage, the patient began to complain about restlessness in her legs causing impaired sleep and daytime somnolence. Polysomnographic investigations found a high index of periodic leg movements during sleep (71/hour), but no sleep disordered breathing. Iron stores were normal. Relief of symptom's severity was obtained with gabapentin 600mg in the evening. We hypothesize a possible involvement of the diencephalospinal pathway in the patient's RLS pathophysiology. A systematic study of focal lesions associated with RLS may contribute to improving our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition. The frequency of RLS associated with lesions of the spinal cord might be underestimated.

This case report describes the course of a 26-year-old female who presented with new-onset seizures and insomnia, complicated by encephalitis. The initial workup ruled out common causes of encephalitis, while a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not identify a mass. Based on the suspicion that she may have autoimmune encephalitis, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange, but continued to deteriorate. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan identified a small hypermetabolic pelvic mass. Shortly thereafter serum and cerebral spinal fluid NMDAR antibody titers were reported as positive, prompting repetition of the TVUS, which confirmed the presence of an ovarian teratoma. The patient had a laparoscopic oophorectomy with subsequent resolution of her symptoms, further confirming the diagnosis. Despite the sensitivities of TVUS and CT of up to 94% and 98%, respectively, the teratoma was unusually small, necessitating the addition of a PET scan to identify the lesion. These neoplasms are thought to have low uptake on PET; however, it is possible that focal inflammation may have enhanced the detection. It is unlikely that the teratoma grew during hospitalization as the average growth rate is 1.8 mm per year. Regardless, the lesson that can be learned is that imaging modalities beyond CT and TVUS, such as PET, can be helpful, as identification of a resectable tumor may alter management and ultimately improve outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,The neuroradiology journal,10.1177/1971400918763578,PMC6111422,NMDA receptor; PET; Seizures; encephalitis; psychosis; teratoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31632341,Anti-IgLON5 Disease: A Case With 11-Year Clinical Course and Review of the Literature.,"Nissen, Mette Scheller; Blaabjerg, Morten",Nissen,"<b>Background:</b> Anti-IgLON5 disease is a novel disorder with a complex interplay between inflammation and neurodegeneration. Patients develop antibodies against IgLON5 but also deposition of neuronal tau protein. Symptoms often have an insidious onset, slow progression and mimic other neurological disorders. Here we report a case with severely prolonged 11-year disease course and provide a review of current reported cases with focus on presentation, work-up, treatment, and outcome. <b>Method:</b> All reported cases of anti-IgLON5 disease were evaluated. Cases reported twice (in case series and as single case reports), were carefully excluded. <b>Results:</b> Most patients display a characteristic sleep disorder with severe insomnia, non rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnia, with finalistic movements and sleep disordered breathing (stridor and obstructive sleep apnea). Other symptoms are bulbar involvement, gait instability, movement disorders, oculomotor abnormalities, dysautonomia, and peripheral symptoms. Antibodies are present in both serum and CSF and there is a strong correlation with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1<sup>*</sup>10:01 and HLA-DQB1<sup>*</sup>05:01. Neuropathological examination reveals neurodegeneration with neuronal tau deposits in regions that correlate with the clinical presentation (e.g., predominantly hypothalamus and tegmentum of the brain stem). Majority of cases respond partially to immunotherapy. Cases, who received no treatment or treatment with IV corticosteroids alone, had a higher mortality than cases treated with more potent immunotherapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> The clinical spectrum of Anti-IgLON5 disease continues to expand. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology, therapeutic strategies and outcome in this novel disorder. Aggressive immunotherapy seems to increase survival.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2019.01056,PMC6783555,IgLON5; autoimmune encephalitis; immunology; inflammation; tau,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) was diagnosed and treated. Because of persistent EDS, snoring and nycturia, a nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) was performed. PSG showed high sleep fragmentation related to a moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) was proposed. Because of the persistence of abnormal nocturnal behaviours, characterized by screaming, punching and falling out of bed, a video-PSG with CPAP treatment was performed. The recording showed typical chin electromyography (EMG) activity increase associated with violent movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorders (RBD). Clinical neurological examination found no parkinsonian syndrome, no dysautonomic sign and no neurological focal sign. Dopamine transporter imaging [123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] did not find any presynaptic dopaminergic pathways degeneration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a vascular lesion suggestive of cavernoma located in the pons. The present case illustrates the complexity of sleep disturbance diagnosis with a possible entanglement of aetiologies responsible for nocturnal agitation, and confirms that an isolated pons cavernoma should be considered among the rare causes of RBD.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of sleep research,10.1111/jsr.12364,,Nocturnal agitation; vascular malformation,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In clinical practice, diagnosis of DIC can often be made by laboratory values, including prolonged coagulation times, thrombocytopenia, or high levels of fibrin degradation products. DIC is frequently observed after neurotrauma, but rarely occurs in patients with primary brain tumors. There are only few case reports of DIC in patients with primary brain tumors, all sharing the highly elevated mortality. We report the case of a young patient presenting with secondary glioblastoma, who developed multiorgan failure induced by DIC after extensive intraoperative bleeding. A 30-year-old patient was admitted in poor general condition with insomnia, severe headache, and vomiting. She had undergone surgery for secondary glioblastoma twice. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left temporoparietal mass lesion with indication for resection. Surgery then was complicated by diffuse intraoperative bleeding due to a high content of microvascular proliferation as shown in the histopathologic workup. Subsequently, an uncontrollable multiorgan failure developed, causing the patient's death 4 days after surgery. Although a rare complication, excessive intraoperative bleeding, especially in surgery for brain tumors located next to the ventricular system, DIC should be kept in mind as a possible diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.02.077,,Bleeding; Disseminated intravascular coagulation; Glioblastoma,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

20420173,[Anti-VGKC antibody-associated limbic encephalitis/Morvan syndrome].,"Misawa, Tamako; Mizusawa, Hidehiro",Misawa,"Anti-voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (anti-VGKC-Ab) cause hyperexcitability of the peripheral nerve and central nervous system. Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability is the chief manifestation of Issacs syndrome and cramp-fasciculation syndrome. Morvan syndrome is characterized by neuromyotonia with autonomic and CNS involvement. Manifestations involving the CNS without peripheral involvement are characteristic of limbic encephalitis and epilepsy. The clinical features of anti-VGKC-Ab-associated limbic encephalitis are subacute onset of episodic memory impairment, disorientation and agitation. Hyponatremia is also noted in most patients. Cortico-steroid therapy, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are effective in treating to not only the clinical symptoms but also hyponatremia. Unlike other anti-VGKC-Ab-associated neurological disorders, paraneoplastic cases are rare. Thus, anti-VGKC-Ab-associated limbic encephalopathy is considered to be an autoimmune, non-paraneoplastic, potentially treatable encephalitis. Morvan syndrome is characterized by widespread neurological symptoms involving the peripheral nervous system (neuromyotonia), autonomic system (hyperhidrosis, severe constipation, urinary incontinence, and cardiac arrhythmia) and the CNS (severe insomnia, hallucinations, impairment of short-term memory and epilepsy). Many patients have an underlying tumor, for example thymoma, lung cancer, testicular cancer and lymphoma; this indicates the paraneoplastic nature of the disease. Needle electro-myography reveals myokimic discharge. In nerve conduction study, stimulus-induced repetitive descharges are frequently demonstrated in involved muscles. Plasma exchange is an effective treatment approach, and tumor resection also improves symptoms. Both VGKC-Ab-associated limbic encephalitis and Morvan syndrome can be successfully treated. Therefore, when these diseases are suspected, it's important to measure the anti-VGKC-Ab level.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Stroke patients who develop depression have slower recovery, greater disability, and higher mortality rates. The pathophysiology of post-stroke depression is not yet clearly defined, but studies suggest contributions from both psychosocial factors and stroke-related factors, such as lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits. Early treatment has a positive impact on post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and survival. We present the case of an 82-year-old man with no psychiatric history who was brought to the psychiatric emergency department after two suicide attempts in the span of 7 days. He was severely depressed, with feelings of hopelessness, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. He had suffered a stroke the week before, affecting the anterior portion of the left cingulate gyrus, causing right hemiparesis and paresthesia.

In this paper, 14 adult patients with hypothalamic hamartoma and epilepsy, of whom three developed epilepsy only in adult life, are presented. The later onset of epilepsy appears to be associated with a milder epilepsy syndrome, less severe learning difficulties and behaviour problems, and better occupational and social status. Gelastic seizures are less prominent in this age group. Of particular interest, one patient had prominent sleep disturbances characterized by a reduction in total slow wave and REM sleep without daytime sleepiness. The milder epilepsy and preserved cognitive and social functioning have implications for management. A number of patients were controlled by anticonvulsant medication, and were functioning satisfactorily. For such patients minimally invasive surgical procedures, or medical therapy should be considered.",{},,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A variety of neurological symptoms may occur in association with the disease, including movement disorders. We report on a 79 year old woman with an unremarkable past medical history who progressively developed psychomotor agitation and insomnia through a period of four months, followed by an acute onset complex hyperkinetic syndrome with chorea, focal left foot dystonia, oral dyskinesias and severe speech impairment. Brain MRI showed multiple subcortical lesions without basal ganglia involvement, and a large cortical lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe that appeared to be ischemic. These findings along with a strongly elevated titer of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I antibodies and positive Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC) suggested a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Syndrome, confirmed 14 weeks later as a Primary syndrome.

Considering the localization of the neuroradiological findings in the pontine reticular formation, where rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is generated, the authors suggested a causal relationship between narcolepsy and MRI abnormalities. Frey and Heiserman, however, found pontine MRI abnormalities in only two of 12 patients with narcolepsy both of whom had long-standing hypertension (2). Pullicino et al. noted similar pontine MRI abnormalities in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy-like ischemic rarefaction of the pons (3). Thus, the changes noted by Plazzi et al. may have been caused by small-vessel disease rather than narcolepsy. To assess whether altered pontine MRI signals are a regular feature of idiopathic narcolepsy, we selected randomly from our database seven patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy.

The participant was a male with severe TBI and cognitive-communication impairments, who subsequently developed sleep and mood disturbance and excessive daytime sleepiness. The Daily Cognitive-Communication and Sleep Profile (D-CCASP), Clinical Interview, Epworth and Stanford Sleepiness Scales and polysomnography assessed sleep and wakefulness. Cognitive-communication was also assessed by the D-CCASP. His sleep, wake and mood difficulties were pharmacologically managed. Baseline polysomnography indicated abnormal sleep. There was a clear positive relationship between quality of sleep, language processing, attention and memory, seen across the phases of the medication intervention (p < 0.01). A comprehensive pharmacological management programme addressing the multi-factorial underlying aetiology was successful in improving sleep, arousal and mood. The D-CCASP was found to be clinically and statistically sensitive to reported changes in cognitive-communication function in relation to improvements in sleep and daytime arousal. These findings suggest that management of sleep/wake disturbances and mood post-traumatic brain injury can potentially facilitate improvements in cognitive-communication function which may, in turn, facilitate participation in rehabilitation and community integration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2011.608215,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The proposed model includes three phases - (1) assessment and education, (2) targeted interventions for specific symptoms and comorbidities (e.g., sleep disturbance, headache, depression), and (3) psychotherapy to address mental health issues. While this is generally the order in which they will occur, the approach is not necessarily linear but rather provides a recommended schema. Media attention on concussion has greatly increased in the last several years, as interest in the possible contribution of concussion(s) to CTE grows. This media attention has some adverse effects in that it creates a false perception about the current state of the science and may engender iatrogenic effects.

A 79-y-old man with right-sided paralysis was admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with cerebral infarction. Nocturnal leg cramps appeared in the affected side and caused sleep disturbance. Supplementation with l-carnitine reduced the number of nocturnal leg cramps and alleviated sleep disturbance. It also plays an important role in nerve protection and treatment for carnitine deficiency. Patients with stroke-induced paralysis experience muscle wasting, which might reduce pooled carnitine in the affected side.

Despite treatment, infection in immunocompromised patients can be lethal, including those with T-cell dysfunction or deficiency. Whether innate immunodeficiencies also predispose to these infections remains less clear. Here, we report a case of disseminated C. neoformans and VZV meningitis in a young male with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and hypocomplementemia and no history of HIV infection, malignancy, or transplant. The patient presented with a pulsating headache, myalgia, joint pain, insomnia, night sweats, and subjective fever, along with clusters of vesicular lesions on his neck and back. A lumbar puncture and an MRI of the brain confirmed C. neoformans and VZV meningitis. Vesicular skin lesions proved to be VZV, and blood culture confirmed fungemia, suggesting disseminated disease. We investigated his medical history further to determine the underlying cause of his prior hypereosinophilia and current meningitis. The patient had idiopathic hypereosinophilia with high IgE levels, low complement levels, high rheumatoid factor levels, and an intermittent rash dating back two years, which had been treated intermittently with prednisone and hydroxyurea, with the most recent admission three weeks prior to this admission. Prior to admission, the patient had a peak absolute eosinophil count of 18.6 x10<sup>3</sup>/uL. The patient was discharged on a daily dose of 60 mg of prednisone without hydroxyurea. In further evaluating his immune status, we found he was HIV-negative, with a normal CD4 count and high IgE. We also tested lymphocyte subsets and proliferation, which showed a low CD16/56 level, suggesting possibly reduced natural killer (NK) cell quantity. The patient responded well to acyclovir, amphotericin, and flucytosine therapy.

Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6-12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF.

But the patient's mental and physical state further deteriorated in subsequent months. During an attack of pneumonia the patients became somnolent and went into status epilepticus. Repeat virological examination of CSF now revealed IgG and IgM antibodies against HSV, confirming encephalitis. Her condition markedly improved over 12 days on aciclovir, 750 mg 3 times daily intravenously. 6 weeks later the pneumonia recurred, as did the encephalitis, with apnoeic phases and massive left heart failure. The patient died a few days later. Immunohistochemical tests of brain tissue were positive for HSV type II. This case report demonstrates that an investigation on dementia must include a complete liquor analysis. If HSV encephalitis is suspected, an antiviral therapy must be administered immediately. Even in adults who seem to have normal immunity HSV type II can cause HSV encephalitis.",{},,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),10.1055/s-2008-1055476,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Germany,ger

A brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed bilateral damage in the dorsolateral midbrain, amygdala, and paramedian thalami. Videopolysomnography disclosed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and a Multiple Sleep Latency Test showed a mean sleep latency of 7 minutes and 4 sleep-onset REM periods. The level of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid was low (49 pg/mL). This observation illustrates that REM sleep behavior disorder and narcoleptic features are 2 REM-sleep abnormalities that (1) may share the same autoimmune-mediated origin affecting the brainstem, limbic, and diencephalic structures and (2) may occur in the setting of the paraneoplastic anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis.",{},,Sleep,10.1093/sleep/30.6.767,PMC1978347,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Self-reactivity arises due to similarities in molecular structures between pathogenic microorganisms and regular body structures with consequent immune-cross reactions. Reactivation of latent Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) infections can cause neurological sequalae, including cerebellitis, post-herpetic neuralgias, meningo/encephalitis, vasculopathy and myelopathy. We propose a syndrome caused by auto-immune reactivity triggered by molecular mimicry between VZV and the brain, culminating in a post-infectious psychiatric syndrome with childhood VZV infections. Two individuals, a 6-year-old male and 10-year-old female developed a neuro-psychiatric syndrome 3-6 weeks following a confirmed VZV infection with intrathecal oligoclonal bands. The 6-year-old male presented with a myasthenic syndrome, behavior deterioration and regression in school, he was poorly responsive to IVIG and risperidone, however had a pronounced response to steroid treatment. The 10-year-old female presented with marked insomnia, agitation, and behavioral regression as well as mild bradykinesia. A trial of neuroleptics and sedatives resulted in a mild unsustained reduction in psychomotor agitation and IVIG was also unsuccessful, however the patient was very responsive to steroid therapy. Psychiatric syndromes with evidence of intrathecal inflammation temporally related to VZV infections that are responsive to immune modulation have not been described before. Here we report two cases demonstrating neuro-psychiatric symptoms following VZV infection, with evidence of persistent CNS inflammation following the resolution of infection, and response to immune modulation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",10.1016/j.bbih.2023.100602,PMC9969201,"ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, CNS – Central Nervous System; Auto-immune encephalitis; CSF – Cerebral Spinal Fluid, IVIG – Intravenous Immunoglobulin; Cross reactivity; Molecular mimicry; NG – Nasogastric, NMDA - N-methyl-D-aspartate; Neuropsychiatric syndrome; PANDAS - Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcus), PANS - Pediatric Acute onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome; PET- FDG - positron emission tomography - fluorodeoxyglucose, VZV - Varicella Zoster Virus; Pediatric varicella zoster virus",Case Reports,United States,eng

In this case study presentation the patient suffered a head trauma, without unconsciousness, and began to experience unusual episodic behaviours. Symptom presentation differed from the typical clinical manifestations of idiopathic narcolepsy leading to an 8-year search for a definitive diagnosis. Key relevant aspects that led to diagnostic ambiguities were the order of symptom development, negative for the antigen HLA DR2, significance of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) mean sleep latency versus number of sleep onset rapid eye movement periods, the somewhat atypical features of cataplexy, the coexistence of sleep apnoea, and the mildness of the original head injury. It is argued that cases of post-traumatic narcolepsy should be considered in the context of their clinical development over time and that practitioners should be aware that this form of narcolepsy can differ from the typical clinical history of idiopathic narcolepsy.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050310001617433,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe the clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings of the study patient and briefly review the relevant literature. A 41-year-old woman was referred to our center for evaluation of worsening mental status changes, a newly diagnosed suprasellar mass, and possible endocrine dysfunction. Three years earlier, a physician at another institution diagnosed idiopathic DI and prescribed desmopressin. At that time, laboratory workup and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no brain lesions or other hormonal irregularities. Slow, progressive symptomatology in the following 3 years included mental status changes, nonhealing skin lesions, recurrent infections, temperature dysregulation, and midsection weight gain. She became withdrawn and emotionally labile and developed a flat affect, short-term memory loss, poor concentration, and sleep disturbance. MRI revealed a 2.2 x 2.1 x 1.9-cm suprasellar region lesion. Biopsy samples from the third ventricular lesion revealed a circumscribed glial tumor. Chordoid glioma is a rare tumor, and the 50 previously reported cases have been located in the suprasellar region. This is the third reported case of a chordoid glioma positive for neurofilament protein, which brings into question the hypothesis of a single phenotype for glial tumors. Tumors in this region frequently result in endocrine dysfunction that prompts patients to seek medical attention. There is no formally recognized treatment protocol for chordoid glioma, and postoperative mortality and morbidity is high. Our report emphasizes the necessity of close follow-up of patients after a diagnosis of idiopathic DI.

His nocturnal behavior was screaming, thrashing of arms, punching or kicking his spouse, and falling out of bed associated with nightmares of being attacked by what he described as, ""terrible animals frightening me."" No remarkable neurological signs were found. Brain MRI was performed on this patient and it revealed a lacunar ischemic infarct in the right paramedian pons. On the nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), there was phasic submental and limb electromyographic (EMG) tone and an absence of electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity during REM sleep. Hence, this patient was diagnosed with pontine infarction and RBD. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25mg nightly resulted in the disappearance of nocturnal events.

To overcome these limitations, interest in traditional East Asian medicine has increased. A 72-year-old Asian woman originally admitted for an intracerebral hemorrhage presented with complaints of an unpleasant sensation throughout the body that appeared at night. The patient was diagnosed with chronic persistent RLS based on the 2012 Revised International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group Diagnostic Criteria. The patient was treated with extracts of the traditional herbal medicines Dangguijakyak-san (DS) and Shihogyeji-tang (ST). After 47 days of therapy, all herbal medicines were discontinued, and symptoms had not returned by the last follow-up 244 days after the initial treatment. One week after initiating herbal treatment with DS and ST, the RLS symptoms began to improve, and the total hours of sleep had increased from 2 to 9 hours by day 21, with a Korean version of the international restless legs scale score of 11 points. On day 36, ST was discontinued, given the continued improvement of symptoms. On day 47, symptoms had disappeared (Korean version of the international restless legs scale score: 0), and sleep disturbances caused by RLS had completely resolved. After day 47, DS was also discontinued. There were no adverse effects associated with the administration of DS and ST, and the symptoms had not recurred by the last follow-up on day 244. In this case, RLS related symptoms, which had been present for approximately 60 years, were improved using only the traditional herbal medicines DS and ST (without dopamine replacement), and no symptoms recurred for 244 days. This case suggests that if replacement therapy is difficult or not desired, herbal medicinal therapies may be an effective alternative. This also suggests that the effect of herbal medicine on RLS might be semi-permanent.

Occasionally, they present with focal neurologic deficits, a dementia-like syndrome, hemorrhage, or ischemic infarction. This study is based on the case of a 71-year-old gentleman who presented with 6 months of progressive forgetfulness, inattention, and hypersomnolence. Four weeks prior to presentation, he developed symptoms of left-sided pain, numbness, and worsening weakness. Neurologic examination demonstrated hypersomnolence, a score of 30/38 on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and left hemiparesis. MRI brain revealed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities with associated enhancement. MR venogram (MRV) showed a vascular malformation in the posterior fossa and occlusion of the straight sinus. Conventional cerebral angiogram confirmed a tentorial dAVF. The dAVF was definitively treated with transarterial embolization, followed by clip ligation of the arterialized draining vein. Twelve weeks later, there was clinical resolution of left hemiparesis and improvement in cognitive status. MRI revealed complete resolution of the thalamic hyperintensities. MRV demonstrated recanalization of the straight sinus. Intracranial dAVFs are uncommon but potentially life-threatening acquired vascular malformations. The initiating factor is venous hypertension, causing retrograde flow, venous congestion, ischemia, and sometimes infarction. The spectrum of clinical manifestations in dAVFs reflects the degree of venous congestion present. If retrograde venous flow is surgically obliterated, then venous hypertension may be reversible. Bilateral thalamic venous congestion can present as a thalamic dementia. We conclude that intracranial dAVFs with thalamic venous congestion should be considered in the diagnostic differential for patients who present with subacute cognitive decline and T2 hyperintense thalamic signal change.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9746-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Clinical application of these levels of infrared energy for this patient with TBI yielded highly favorable outcomes with decreased depression, anxiety, headache, and insomnia, whereas cognition and quality of life improved. Neurological function appeared to improve based on changes in the SPECT by quantitative analysis. NIR in the power range of 10-15 W at 810 and 980 nm can safely and effectively treat chronic symptoms of TBI.",{},,Advances in mind-body medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, respiratory care for patients with CAHS caused by lateral medullary infarction (CAHS-LMI) remains an important unsolved problem. We describe 2 patients with CAHS-LMI and review the case reports for 17 previously described patients. Patient 1 was a 78-year-old man who was referred to our hospital because of dizziness. After admission, Wallenberg syndrome developed. Magnetic resonance imaging showed left LMI. He had hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis the next afternoon and temporarily received mechanical ventilation. A tracheotomy was performed on the 12th hospital day, and the patient was weaned from the ventilator on the 18th hospital day. Patient 2 was 72-year-old man who was referred to our hospital because of dizziness and gait disturbance. Wallenberg syndrome was diagnosed after admission, and magnetic resonance imaging showed right LMI. His consciousness deteriorated, and hypercapnia developed on the ninth hospital day. The patient received ventilatory support, and a tracheotomy was performed on the 12th hospital day. He was weaned from the ventilator by the 16th hospital day. Consistent with our findings, most previously reported cases of CAHS-LMI were initially associated with mild symptoms, which subsequently worsened. Five of the 19 patients (26.3%) died within 1 month after onset, and 7 patients (36.8%) died within 1 year. Tracheotomy was performed in 12 patients, 2 of whom died 1 month after onset (16.7%); another patient died of chronic renal failure after 2 years. Tracheotomy seemed to be an effective procedure in patients with CAHS-LMI. We speculate that tracheotomy assists alveolar ventilation by reducing dead space ventilation.

Although left hemiplegic due to cerebral hemorrhage and impaired consciousness due to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) appeared postoperatively, anticoagulant therapy quickly improved CVST and impaired consciousness. However, various unexplained symptoms such as insomnia, hallucination, impulsivity, impaired consciousness, and a new type of drug-resistant cluster seizures gradually developed over a 2-month period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the gradual extension of a hyperintense area from the right frontal lobe on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse was initiated from postoperative day (POD) 74, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, although white blood cell counts were normal in all three cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations. After IVIg therapy, the above unexplained symptoms promptly improved. On POD 103, antibodies against NMDAR were revealed in both the serum and CSF collected before these immunotherapies.

Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2020). Presented here is a case of Bing Neel syndrome (BNS) found in a 69-year-old man who died by suicide by jumping off a 135' bridge. His medical history was significant for traumatic brain injury, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. Bing Neel syndrome is a rare central nervous system complication of WM. His wife reported an abrupt mental deterioration starting 5 years before his death, characterized by paranoia, depression, and insomnia. He had been a high-functioning university professor. His decline culminated with the loss of independence in his activities of daily living. At autopsy, it was found that he experienced blunt force injuries related to the fall, causing his death. A neuropathologic examination revealed a brisk and fulminant clonal CD20 + /immunoglobulin M+ lymphocytic infiltrate, involving all sampled regions of his brain, consistent with WM. This workup was critical to obtaining an accurate pathologic diagnosis of BNS and understanding his full clinical status before death. Although BNS was not the proximate cause of death, this diagnosis aided the death investigation as a causal factor in his suicidality and was vital to providing his family closure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,10.1097/PAF.0000000000000824,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Recently, a paradoxical arousing effect of zolpidem in patients with severe brain damage has been repeatedly reported. A placebo-controlled magnetic resonance study was conducted to evaluate its effect on BOLD and metabolites spectral signals in a patient with severe brain injuries and an age-matched healthy volunteer. A multi-modal analysis was used to assess aspects in the pharmacologically-induced changes in the resting-state brain metabolism. A significantly increased BOLD signal was transiently localized in the left frontal cortices, bilateral anterior cingulated areas, left thalamus and right head of the caudate nucleus. The healthy subject showed a deactivation of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. BOLD signal changes were found to significantly correlate with concentrations of extravascular metabolites in the left frontal cortex. It is discussed that, when zolpidem attaches to modified GABA receptors of neurodormant brain cells, brain activation is induced. This might explain the significant correlations of BOLD signal changes and proton-MRS metabolites in this patient after zolpidem. It was concluded that proton-MRS and BOLD signal assessment could be used to study zolpidem-induced metabolic modulation in a resting state.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.794961,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The sleep-wake cycle and daily mood was measured for 11 consecutive days. The patient met diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder (excluding the requirement that the disturbance must not be due to a medical disorder) and delayed sleep-phase syndrome. Across 11 days, the patient exhibited elevated positive, but not negative, mood. Correlational analyses indicated a possible association between mood and sleep disturbance. This pattern of findings implicates the temporal lobe in positive mood regulation and sleep-related impairments.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050701644111,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

1341692,Magnetic fields mimic the behavioral effects of REM sleep deprivation in humans.,"Sandyk, R; Tsagas, N; Anninos, P A; Derpapas, K",Sandyk,"The discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep by Aserinsky and Kleitman in 1953 initiated the impetus for sleep research and specifically the investigations of the effects of REM sleep deprivation (RSD) on animal and human behavior. The behavioral effects of RSD include the enhancement of motivational and ""drive""-related behaviors. In laboratory animals, RSD has been reported to increase appetite, sexual behavior, aggressiveness, and locomotor activity. Moreover, RSD reportedly improves mood in patients with endogenous depression and heightens appetite and sexual interest in normal subjects. Since ""drive""-related behaviors are thought to involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites, RSD may enhance motivational behaviors through an action on limbic dopaminergic functions. In the present communication, we present two patients (one with multiple sclerosis and the other with Parkinson's disease) in whom treatment with magnetic fields produced behavioral effects which paralleled those observed in REM-sleep-deprived animals and humans. We propose, therefore, that the behavioral and mental effects of treatment with magnetic fields may be mediated via RSD and, by inference, involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459209003278,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Brain magnetic resonance (MR) images showed acute infarctions involving the right dorsolateral medulla, bilateral cerebellar vermis and paramedian cerebellar hemispheres. MR angiography showed nonvisualization of the right vertebral artery. Transcranial Doppler sonography showed a high resistance flow profile in the right vertebral artery and normal flow patterns in the basilar artery and left vertebral artery. These findings suggest that the medullary and bilateral cerebellar infarcts were caused by stenosis/pseudo-occlusion of the right vertebral artery.

We included patients with moderate and severe TBI determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale, sleep disturbance was assessed using actigraphy, and agitation was assessed using the Agitated Behavior Scale. Patients (n = 29) were more severely ill and had poorer six-month outcomes in Eastern vs. Western Denmark. Recovery was similar at one-year follow-up. Protocol improvements were needed in relation to inclusion criteria, intervention delivery, patient assessment, and follow-up outcomes. In TBI-rehabilitation studies, we suggest adding the severity of disease score to the initial GCS score and a delirium detection score to the ABS score.

TM suffered significant brain damage as a result of a large subarachnoid haemorrhage of his right anterior cerebral artery complicated by midline shift and subsequent infarction of his left middle cerebral artery. In addition to challenging behaviour and cognitive impairment, TM presented with a recurrent disturbed sleep-wake pattern that significantly worsened his quality-of-life. He was diagnosed as suffering of non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder. Challenge was recorded using the Overt Aggression Scale Modified for Neuro-Rehabilitation (OASMNR). Typical hypnotics had no or ill effects. Agomelatine prescription (25 mg) led to significant OASMNR and sleep efficiency change with effects apparent at 1.5 years later.

She was immunosuppressed with high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchange and rituximab, and showed signs of neurological improvement clinically and radiologically. Unfortunately, she succumbed to septic shock from prolonged intensive care. This is the first report of NMDARE in an indigenous patient from the eastern SSA.

This 44-year-old retired NFL player manifested a premortem history of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, which included in part, chronic depression, suicide attempts, insomnia, paranoia, and impaired memory before he finally committed suicide. A full autopsy was performed with Polymerase Chain Reaction-based analyses of his blood to determine the apolipoprotein genotype. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on topographical gross sections of the brain. Autopsy confirmed a fatal gunshot wound of the head. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3 and the brain tissue revealed diffuse cerebral taupathy (Neurofibrillary Tangles and Neuritic Threads). This will be the third case of CTE in a national football player, which has been reported in the medical literature. Omalu et al., reported the first two cases in 2005 and 2006. This case series manifested similar premortem history of neuropsychiatric impairment with autopsy evidence of cerebral taupathy without any neuritic amyloidopathy. For a definitive diagnosis of CTE to be made, and for medicolegal purposes, a full autopsy must be performed with histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses of the brain to identify the presence of Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) and Neuritic Threads (NTs). Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to confirm the common denominators and epidemiology of CTE in professional American football players, which have been identified by this case series.",{},,Journal of forensic nursing,10.1111/j.1939-3938.2009.01064.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It is seldom encountered in the radiotherapy clinic but can pose significant technical challenges and safety concerns in the delivery of a prescribed radiation course. We report a unique case of successful delivery of radiotherapy for ependymoma in a patient with Ondine׳s curse. A 53-year-old gentleman presented with vertigo when lying down. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing mass in the floor of the fourth ventricle. He underwent maximal safe resection. Pathology revealed ependymoma. The patient was referred for radiotherapy. Computed tomography simulation was performed in supine position with 3-point thermoplastic mask immobilization. Sequential TomoTherapy plans were developed. At first scheduled treatment, shortly after mask placement, his arms went limp and he was unresponsive. Vitals showed oxygen saturation 83%, pulse 127, and blood pressure 172/97mmHg. He was diagnosed with Ondine׳s curse thought secondary to previous brainstem damage; the combination of lying flat and pressure from the mask was causing him to go into respiratory arrest. As supine positioning did not seem clinically advisable, he was simulated in prone position. A RapidArc plan and a back-up conformal plan were developed. Prescriptions were modified to meet conservative organs-at-risk constraints. Several strategies were used to minimize uncertainties in set-up reproducibility associated with prone positioning. He tolerated prone RapidArc treatments well.

Sleep studies in 1 patient showed hypercarbia and hypoxia accompanying sleep. In both cases autopsy showed plaques of multiple sclerosis in the medulla oblongata, incompletely involving the neuroanatomic areas of the medullary reticular formation controlling automatic breathing. A systematic analysis of the location of the plaques in relation to areas known to be important in breathing control revealed that the regions corresponding to the ventral nuclear complex of respiratory control in animals were incompletely and unilaterally involved in both cases. Close correlation with nuclei that have been demonstrated in animal experiments to be important in descending respiratory control of phrenic and intercostal musculature was not possible due to possible differences in anatomy between animals and humans, and the fact that plaques of MS affect axons of passage and spare neuronal cell bodies. Nevertheless, the cases clearly illustrate that patchy, unilateral lesions of the medullary reticular formation in humans can give rise to sleep disordered breathing. The cases also illustrate the risk of death during sleep in MS patients with demyelination in the medulla oblongata, and demonstrate the need to carefully examine the medulla in MS patients if they die unexpectedly during sleep.",{},,Clinical neuropathology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A brain MRI showed a hyperintense area in the lower right brainstem laterally within the medulla, which corresponds to the area of the pathways descending from the autonomic breathing control center. During hospitalization, the patient had several episodes of prolonged apnea, mainly when asleep, having often to be ""reminded"" to breath. A tracheostomy was then performed with the patient under mechanical ventilation. Treatment with medroxyprogesterone, fluoxetine and acetazolamide was also started. He was discharged after 64 days breathing environmental air with no apparent episodes of apnea. He returned to the emergency room in the following day with a clinical picture of aspiration bronchopneumonia, followed by septic shock and death. the Ondine's curse is one of the posterior stroke's presentation characterized by loss of automatic breathing and for the unpredictability of clinical evolution and prognosis. Such a syndrome has rarely been reported in adults and the diagnostic criteria are not consensual in the reviewed literature. Thus any diagnostic confirmation should be flexible.

While most of the nocturnal bruxism cases seen in the general population are apparently idiopathic, it has been reported to be associated with a range of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease, cranio-cervical dystonia and post-anoxic brain damage, but not multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe three cases of MS patients who have had moderate to severe complaints of bruxism in the two weeks following their relevant MS attacks. None of the three patients had a diagnosis of bruxism prior to her attack. The diagnosis was confirmed in one out of three by a polysomnography. One patient did not have any complaints related to bruxism previous to her attack, whereas two had mild and infrequent complaints. The symptoms of the relevant attacks were left hemihypesthesia in all and hemiparesis in two. None of the patients had spasticity that could result in severe teeth clenching. All three patients presented with morning headaches and jaw pain or tightness and were treated successfully with botulinum toxin (Btx) injections applied to their masseter and temporalis muscles. The cause of bruxism is controversial but lesions of the cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cotrical loops are thought to be most likely. However, acute or chronic lesions in those pathways were not demonstrated in the 3 patients.

During his hospitalization at the Department of Neurology, he developed visual hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, insomnia, and strong emotional response. An extensive laboratory screening was performed and showed no abnormal findings. Suspecting peduncular hallucinosis due to the brainstem lesion, treatment with quetiapine and melatonin was administered to the patient and symptoms resolved completely within days. Subsequently, gradual neurological clinical improvement was also noted and two weeks after his admission, a repeated brain CT and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed partial absorption of the brainstem hemorrhage.

7201114,Sleep-stage-dependent Cheyne-Stokes respiration after cerebral infarct: a case study.,"Power, W R; Mosko, S S; Sassin, J F",Power,"Polysomnographic studies of nocturnal sleep were performed on a 63-year-old women. Sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia dated back to a cerebral infarction at age 53, which resulted in bilateral cerebral injury. Two patterns of respiration were observed, and both were sleep-stage-dependent. Classic Cheyne-Stokes respiration predominated during slow-wave sleep and stages 1 and 2. REM sleep, in contrast, was associated almost exclusively with normal respiration. Recurrent brief arousals, temporally linked to the Cheyne-Stokes pattern of respiration, markedly disturbed sleep stages 1 and 2 and appeared related to the patient's subjective sleep complaints. During waking, REM, and NREM sleep, respiration is known to have different sensitivity to CNS and peripheral controls. The selective association of Cheyne-Stokes respiration with NREM sleep in this patient supports the view that anatomically separate CNS mechanisms regulate respiration in REM and NREM sleep.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.32.7.763,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The diagnostic clinical criteria for EL like illness include subacute hypersomnolence and ophthalmoparesis followed by Parkinsonism, oculogyric crisis, neuropsychiatric disorders and central respiratory abnormality. Recently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which depicts hypersignal intensity on T2 weighted, and FLAIR images at midbrain, tegmentum, and basal ganglia, have been very helpful diagnostic tests in EL like illness. Nevertheless, EL like illness has never been reported in Thailand. A 17 year-old man presented with hypersomnolence one week before admission. Physical examination revealed drowsiness and ophthalmoparesis. MRI showed bilateral hypersignal intensity lesions on T2 weighted and FLAIR images at midbrain, basal ganglia and temporal lobes. CSF studies showed normal profiles. CSF-PCR for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Pan-Enterovirus and Westnile virus were negative. CSF Dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus hemagglutination test were negative. He was treated with intravenous dexamethasone and immunoglobulin. Somnolence and ophthalmoparesis were improved. Two months later, he developed schizophreniform features and Parkinsonism. MRI revealed improvement of midbrain and basal ganglia lesions. CSF studies showed normal CSF profiles while oligoclonal bands were positive. Autoimmune profiles and serological tests for post-streptococcal infection as well as syphilis were negative.

We present details on a patient with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome who initially visited an ophthalmologist because of visual symptoms. A 34-year-old Japanese woman complained of sustained headache and insomnia starting 2 days after her first childbirth. In addition to the severe headache, a visual field defect was also observed 10 days later. Best corrected visual acuity at the initial visit was 20/20 and 20/25 for the right and left eye, respectively. Exudative retinal detachment was noted surrounding both optic heads. Visual field testing revealed left homonymous hemianopsia, while magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of edema and infarction of the bilateral basal nuclei and right occipital lobe. The homonymous hemianopsia and exudative retinal detachment recovered immediately after treatment with a free-radical scavenger and anticoagulant.

The patient was studied with long-term video-stereo-electroencephalographic monitoring by means of stereotactically implanted intracerebral electrodes. Video-stereo-electroencephalography demonstrated that minor events and paroxysmal arousals, as well as major attacks, were correlated with a discharge in the right supplementary motor area and central cingulate gyms. The increasing complexity of these sleep-related ictal motor behaviors reflected a different pattern of discharge, with a progressive spread to other frontal and extrafrontal areas in the fully developed attacks. Surgical resection of the right supplementary motor area and central cingulate gyrus was performed. In the 5 years since the operation, the patient has remained completely seizure free. This study clearly demonstrates the ictal origin of minor events in nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.

Some cases of Wernicke encephalopathy are related to appetite loss; however, the degree to which loss of appetite leads to thiamine deficiency is not known. A 63-year-old female with advanced cancer of the external genitalia was referred for psychiatric consultation because of disorientation, insomnia, and bizarre behaviors. Her symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for delirium. Routine laboratory examinations did not reveal the cause of the delirium. Thiamine deficiency was suspected because appetite loss had continued for 19 days since she had been admitted to hospital. Intravenous administration of thiamine resulted in recovery from the delirium within three days. Serum thiamine level was found to be 16 ng/ml (normal range: 24-66 ng/ml). The clinical findings, the low level of thiamine in the serum, and the effective alleviation of delirious symptoms after thiamine administration fulfilled Francis's criteria for delirium induced by thiamine deficiency. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of Wernicke encephalopathy in cancer patients, especially in those with loss of appetite for longer than 18 days. The degree of appetite loss in such patients might serve as a reference. Early detection and intervention may alleviate the symptoms of delirium and prevent irreversible brain damage.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Palliative & supportive care,10.1017/S1478951515000875,,Cancer; Delirium; Thiamine deficiency; Wernicke encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It is a case of pathologically confirmed, and clinico-pathologically assessed limbic encephalitis with cerebellar degeneration. The patient was a 63-year old male, with a well followed up medical history of gastric cancer 8 years earlier. Four weeks after he presented himself at our hospital his memory and disorientation progressively declined. A neurological examination revealed gaze nystagmus, with potential secondary dementia. However, no abnormal findings were detected from systemic radiological examination, or from chemical analyses. Two months later, after the onset of the disease, he presented additional symptoms, including seizure, gait disturbance, and insomnia. On admission, neurological examinations revealed gaze nystagmus and progression of dementia; however, his thought process was relatively preserved. No paroxysmal synchronized discharge was seen on electroencephalogram. Chest X-rays showed an inflammatory infiltration. In spite of anti-biotic medication, he died due to respiratory failure. The autopsy was limited to the brain. Histologically, limited lymphocytic infiltration into the hippocampus through the entorhinal cortex, with marked neuronal loss and gliosis was observed. Neuronophagia, microglial nodules, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration were also seen. Additionally, most of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were lost, with Bergmann's gliosis and sparse lymphocytic infiltration. No tumor was observed in the brain. Pathological findings of the brain were compatible with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and cerebellar degeneration, though no neoplasm, clinically or pathologically, was detected in this patient. Consequently, it is suggested that when a senile patient presents sub-acute onset of progressive dementia, with a variety of neurological symptoms, paraneoplastic syndrome is to be taken into consideration, even if a tumor or an auto-antibody is not detected since the resection of the tumor is still the best therapeutic means.

The CTE surveillance at the Brain Injury Research Institute was therefore expanded to include deceased military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old United States Marine Corps (USMC) Iraqi war veteran, an amphibious assault vehicle crewman, who committed suicide by hanging after two deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. He experienced combat and was exposed to mortar blasts and improvised explosive device blasts less than 50 m away. Following his second deployment he developed a progressive history of cognitive impairment, impaired memory, behavioral and mood disorders, and alcohol abuse. Neuropsychiatric assessment revealed a diagnosis of PTSD with hyperarousal (irritability and insomnia) and numbing. He committed suicide approximately 8 months after his honorable discharge from the USMC. His brain at autopsy appeared grossly unremarkable except for congestive brain swelling. There was no atrophy or remote focal traumatic brain injury such as contusional necrosis or hemorrhage. Histochemical and immunohistochemical brain tissue analysis revealed CTE changes comprising multifocal, neocortical, and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads (ranging from none, to sparse, to frequent) with the skip phenomenon, accentuated in the depths of sulci and in the frontal cortex. The subcortical white matter showed mild rarefaction, sparse perivascular and neuropil infiltration by histiocytes, and mild fibrillary astrogliosis. Apolipoprotein E genotype was 3/4. The authors report this case as a sentinel case of CTE in an Iraqi war veteran diagnosed with PTSD to possibly stimulate new lines of thought and research in the possible pathoetiology and pathogenesis of PTSD in military veterans as part of the CTE spectrum of diseases, and as chronic sequelae and outcomes of repetitive traumatic brain injuries.",{},,Neurosurgical focus,10.3171/2011.9.FOCUS11178,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The neurorehabilitation of TBI focuses on enhancing recovery and improving quality of life. Zolpidem, traditionally used for short-term management of insomnia, has shown potential in improving cognitive functions and language in TBI patients. Advances in neuroimaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), have facilitated the exploration of the effects of therapeutic interventions on brain activity and functional connectivity in TBI patients. We present the case of a 34-year-old male who sustained a TBI from a traffic collision. Despite severe impairments in cognitive and language functions, administration of 10 mg of zolpidem resulted in temporary but significant improvements in these areas, as evidenced by increased Mini-Mental State Examination scores and observed behavioral changes. fNIRS assessments before and after zolpidem administration revealed notable changes in cerebral cortex activity, including increased left hemisphere activation and a shift in functional connectivity to the bilateral frontal lobes, corresponding with the patient's improvement. This case study highlights the potential of zolpidem, a medication traditionally used for insomnia, in enhancing cognitive and verbal functions in a patient with TBI, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for zolpidem in neurorehabilitation, supported by changes in brain activity and connectivity observed through fNIRS. However, further investigation is warranted to validate these findings and elucidate zolpidem's long-term effects on cognitive and functional outcomes in TBI patients.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000038964,PMC11245188,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In the literature, there are reports of CSA caused by brainstem infarcts. We report two patients (38 and 53 years old) with longstanding history of central sleep apnoea who died during sleep. In both cases the autopsy revealed acute bilateral hypoxic lesions at the level of the solitary tract nuclei. In one case, symmetrical selective neuronal necrosis was found in the dorsal part of the solitary tract nuclei. A chronic obstructive vasculopathy was also found, with thickening and fibrosis of the smallest vessels of the medullary tegmentum. In the other case, bilateral infarctions were found with the base at the ependymal lining of the 4th ventricle floor and the apex towards the solitary tract. An acute intramural hemorrhagic lesion in the premedullary segment of the left vertebral artery was also found. Episodes of hypoxemic hypoxia during sleep may worsen the effects of focal oligohemic hypoxia in the medullary tegmentum. Selective stroke of the solitary tract nuclei may be the acute fatal lesion in patients with both central sleep apnoea and lesions of the vertebro-basilar system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neuropathologic report of acute medullary ischemic-hypoxic lesions which may not be considered the cause of the CSA because of their recent onset. Our findings suggest that CSA, besides being caused by ischemic events at the level of the medulla, may also contribute to pathogenesis of strokes, through hypoxia or hemodynamic oscillations.",{},,Clinical neuropathology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A narcolepsy-cataplexy episode with associated hypertension and bradycardia was triggered during examination. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the episode. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were compatible with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affecting the mesencephalon, pons and rostral medulla oblongata. The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities. Although very rare, symptomatic narcolepsy/cataplexy can occur in dogs and can be secondary to brainstem encephalitis. Cardiovascular changes can occur in association with narcolepsy/cataplexy and should be considered when dealing with patients presenting with these specific clinical signs.</b>","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6892,,CSF (cerebrospinal fluid); MUO (meningoencephalitis of unknown origin); REM (rapid eye movement),Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, some other symptoms, such as mental disorder or abnormal behavior, are atypical, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of epilepsy, sleepwalking, infarction, or mental disorder, among others. We report a case of a patient with type 2 diabetes who presented with abnormal nocturnal behavior due to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia was diagnosed based on a blood glucose level of 2.1 mmol/L when the patient turned up disoriented unresponsive, unable to understand what was said to him, and producing nonsensical speech. After the patient ate a piece of chocolate, his consciousness returned to normal and all mental symptoms disappeared. Polysomnography (PSG) was synchronously performed. The results of the PSG did not show any signs of abnormality during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We regulated his dose of insulin. No additional episodes occurred during the 3-month follow-up. Therefore, the abnormal nocturnal behavior of this patient was determined to be due to hypoglycemia, while the cause of the hypoglycemia was insulin overuse. For physicians, if the cause of abnormal behavior cannot be detected, hypoglycemia should be suspected.

During apnea episodes simultaneous recordings revealed reduced intra-arterial oxygen but increased carbon dioxide saturation. This resulted in an increased CBFV (220 to 320 cm/s) and suggested intermittent hemodynamic relevance of a structurally only moderate MCA stenosis. Intracranial artery stenosis can become hemodynamically significant due to episodic hypercapnia in patients with SA.

Combined lesion of the paramedian thalamus and mesencephalon bilaterally is extremely rare. Little is known about the breathing disturbances of the particular region due to the lesion. The following describes the specific case of a woman, age 62, with bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic stroke. Initially, the patient's complaints exhibited altered vigilance and vertical gaze palsy. Notably, following the acute phase, fluctuating hypersomnia was detected. The MRI (brain) revealed an ischemic lesion in the medial part of the mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus, bilaterally. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the involvement and characteristics of sleep-related breathing abnormalities in the clinical manifestation of the combined paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic stroke. Polysomnographic recordings were accomplished seven times with 1-week interval between the consecutive recordings, toward investigating the early changes of sleep and sleep-related breathing abnormalities. Sleep structure examination featured a decrease in N3 and REM ratio and an increase in N1 and N2 ratio with minimal improvement during the recovery period. In contrast, significant changes were found in the breathing pattern: the initial central apnea dominance was followed by obstructive apneas with a gradual decrease of the total pathological respiratory events. In addition to the structural abnormality of the sleep regulating network, sleep-disordered breathing is another possible cause of hypersomnia in patients afflicted with the present localization of the lesion.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,10.1007/s11325-015-1212-0,,Central apnea; Hypersomnia; Mesencephalon; Obstructive apnea; Paramedian thalamus; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

General autopsy failed to identify a primary neoplasm or an anatomic cause of death. Investigation of sudden respiratory cessation was a consideration when undertaking an anatomic study of the brain. Review of patient records and careful examination of the brain following autopsy were carried out. The patient had terminal episodes of hypersomnia but episodes of sleep apnea were not observed. She received no respiratory support and no respiratory difficulties were recorded until she was pronounced dead at 7 a.m. Autopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma in a pattern suggestive of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, including multiple cerebral metastases, although no significant pulmonary lesions of any type were found. A 0.2 cm metastatic adenocarcinoma was found in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). No other tumor was present in the brain stem. Unilateral destruction of the NTS in the medulla would have severely disturbed the most critical point of convergence of autonomic and voluntary respiratory control and of cardiocirculatory reflexes in the central autonomic network. It is postulated that this caused respiratory arrest during a state transition from sleeping to waking. Few metastases to the medulla are reported, most are relatively large, and several have caused respiratory symptoms before death. The very small metastasis in our patient could be the direct anatomic cause of death, and as such it is an unusual complication of metastatic disease of which clinicians should be aware. It is speculated that dysfunction of direct NTS connections to the pons or of connections passing close to the metastatic deposit resulted in terminal hypersomnia.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography showed an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right internal carotid artery, close to the circadian pacemaker structure (the suprachiasmatic nuclei), which was later occluded.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2004.059295,PMC1739733,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
24705834,[Case of herpes simplex encephalitis with hypersomnia and low orexin level in the cerebrospinal fluid].,"Mukaino, Akihiro; Kinoshita, Ikuo; Fukushima, Naomi; Otsubo, Mayumi; Kanbayashi, Takashi",Mukaino,"A 60-year-old woman suffered from high fever (38°C) and abnormal behavior, was admitted to our hospital on the seventh day of the fever. At admission, she was stuporous, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed pleocytosis (55/μl, monocytes). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images showed high-intensity signals in the medial temporal lobe, inferior surface of the frontal cortex, right cerebellar vermis, and left thalamus. We diagnosed herpes simplex encephalitis, based on the finding of an elevated titer of herpes simplex virus antibody in the CSF (2.90). She was started on treatment with acyclovir and steroid pulse therapy, which was followed by rapid clinical improvement. After recovering from the stupor, the patient exhibited the symptoms of hypersomnia with low orexin level in the CSF. Thus, we should bear in mind that other than consciousness disturbance, patients with herpes simplex encephalitis can also present with rare complications due to the extent of the lesions.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.54.207,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
21485169,[Hemiparkinsonism due to a solitary infarction of the right external segment of the globus pallidus: a case report].,"Hirota, Naomi; Sakajiri, Kenichi; Nitta, Eishun; Komuro, Ryutaro",Hirota,"Three months prior to presentation, a 76-year-old woman suffered from insomnia and was prescribed some antidepressants and hypnotics. At that time, brain MRI showed no cerebral infarcts. Having developed an action tremor of the left hand, bradykinesia, and unstable gait, she visited our hospital. Neurological examination revealed rigidity of the neck and left limbs, clumsiness of the left hand, action tremor, and decreasing swing of the left arm while walking. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy showed no decrease of the heart/mediastinum ratio. The second MRI showed an old cerebral infarct located just in the right external segment of the globus pallidus. Since drug-induced parkinsonism was suspected, paroxetine and trazodone were discontinued, but her symptoms did not improve. We concluded that her hemiparkinsonism was due to the cerebral infarct in the right external segment of the globus pallidus, because her symptoms did not respond to dopamine agonist and L-dopa therapy, and the onset of symptoms corresponded with the time of appearance of the cerebral infarct. This is a rare case that is important for understanding the mechanism of parkinsonism.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.51.215,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
26656284,Altered functional connectivity in lesional peduncular hallucinosis with REM sleep behavior disorder.,"Geddes, Maiya R; Tie, Yanmei; Gabrieli, John D E; McGinnis, Scott M; Golby, Alexandra J; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan",Geddes,"Brainstem lesions causing peduncular hallucinosis (PH) produce vivid visual hallucinations occasionally accompanied by sleep disorders. Overlapping brainstem regions modulate visual pathways and REM sleep functions via gating of thalamocortical networks. A 66-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed abrupt-onset complex visual hallucinations with preserved insight and violent dream enactment behavior. Brain MRI showed restricted diffusion in the left rostrodorsal pons suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was diagnosed on polysomnography. We investigated the integrity of ponto-geniculate-occipital circuits with seed-based resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) in this patient compared to 46 controls. Rs-fcMRI revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the lesion and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), and between LGN and visual association cortex compared to controls. Conversely, functional connectivity between brainstem and visual association cortex, and between visual association cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in the patient. Focal damage to the rostrodorsal pons is sufficient to cause RBD and PH in humans, suggesting an overlapping mechanism in both syndromes. This lesion produced a pattern of altered functional connectivity consistent with disrupted visual cortex connectivity via de-afferentation of thalamocortical pathways.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.10.015,PMC4820074,Hallucinations; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Lesion; Lewy body dementia; Pareidolia; Parkinson's disease; Prefrontal cortex; Resting state fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Immunohistochemistry for distemper virus antigen showed positive staining of the cytoplasm of many neurones of the pons and cerebral cortex. The pathological pattern was suggestive of post-vaccinal distemper encephalitis and the localization of the lesions was consistent with the neurological syndrome shown by the animal.

We report the case of a patient who, after three weeks of fever, presented an anamnestic syndrome, associated with confusion and partial seizures. MRI showed left hyperintensity of mesial temporal structures on Flair images and right hippocampal atrophy on T1 weighted sequences. Laboratory tests only showed high level of anti-TPO antibodies. Thus, the patient was considered as having Hashimoto's encephalopathy. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone with no improvement of symptoms. On the contrary, the patient suffered from insomnia, deep diurnal drowsiness and complete disappearance of REM sleep. Episodes of hypothermia and severe hyponatremia were recorded. Serum VGKC antibodies were found at high level. After intravenous immunoglobulin treatment followed by methylprednisolone, we noted remarkable improvement of clinical status. Polysomnography showed reappearence of REM sleep. This case report broadens the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with VGKC antibodies and suggests that VGKC are implicated in regulation of sleep. The potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking sleep disturbances and VGKC antibodies are discussed.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2007.08.007,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Initially total duration of sleep was brief (less than 4 h) with a high REM/NREM ratio and a short paradoxical sleep (PS) latency. In addition, periodic breathing and tremor were observed. Slow injection of delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) improved sleep both quantitatively and qualitatively, although PS latency remained short. These effects were reversible.

Case-control study of patients with OSA attending a specialist sleep clinic and matched control subjects drawn from the normal community. Forty-five sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness, matched to 45 control subjects without excessive sleepiness or evidence of OSA on a sleep study. Matched variables included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease. N/A. All subjects underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings (before treatment in OSA patients) and sagittal T1, axial T2, and coronal dual echo cerebral MRI imaging to detect clinically silent abnormalities related to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease; areas of high signal foci in deep white matter (DWM), lacunae, and periventricular hyperintensity. Lacunae/high signal foci in DWM and/or periventricular hyperintensity were present in 15 (33%) OSA subjects and 16 (35%) controls, despite significant increases in mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (4.6mmHg, p<0.05), and both nighttime diastolic (7.2mmHg, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressures (9.2mmHg, p<0.05) in OSA subjects. These data exclude more than a 17% excess prevalence of MRI detected minor cerebrovascular disease in the OSA patients, with 95% confidence. Sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease is prevalent in both clinic patients with OSA and their matched control subjects.
