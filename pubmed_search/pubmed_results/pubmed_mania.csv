31996626,Autonomic Hyperactivity.,"Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Rabinstein,"Autonomic hyperactivity is a relatively common consequence of severe acute brain injury and can also be seen with spinal cord and peripheral nerve disorders. This article reviews basic pathophysiologic concepts regarding autonomic hyperactivity, its various forms of clinical presentation, and practical management considerations. Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is most common after traumatic brain injury but can also occur after other forms of severe acute diffuse or multifocal brain injury. Formal criteria for the diagnosis and severity grading of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity have now been proposed. A growing body of literature is beginning to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this disorder, but treatment remains based on observational data. Our mechanistic understanding of other distinct forms of autonomic hyperactivity, such as autonomic dysreflexia after traumatic spinal cord injury and dysautonomia after Guillain-Barré syndrome, remains rudimentary, yet clinical experience shows that their appropriate management can minimize the risk of serious complications. Syndromes of autonomic hyperactivity can result from injury at all levels of the neuraxis. Much more research is needed to refine our understanding of these disorders and guide optimal management decisions.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000811,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Strokes are often associated with psychiatric symptoms, particularly depressive and, more rarely, manic. We herein report a case of bipolar disorder secondary to cerebrovascular disease in a 67-year-old man with no personal or family history of psychiatric illness who, at the age of 64, had a bilateral ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. About 20 days after this stroke, he experienced a manic episode. Three years later, he experienced a second manic episode, with another hospitalization in a psychiatric ward. With this case, we intend to emphasize that, although rare, the diagnosis of mania after stroke should not be forgotten, and most important, one should be aware of the recurrence of affective episodes just as in non-medical-caused bipolar disorder.",{},,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,10.1097/NMD.0000000000001410,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It typically manifests with petechial rash, deteriorating mental status, and progressive respiratory insufficiency, usually occurring within 24-48 h of trauma with long-bone fractures or an orthopedic surgery. The diagnosis of FES is based on clinical and imaging findings, but requires exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Although there is no specific treatment for FES, prompt recognition is important because it can avoid unnecessary interventions and clarify prognosis. Patients with severe FES can become critically ill, but even comatose patients with respiratory failure may recover favorably. Prophylactic measures, such as early stabilization of fractures and certain intraoperative techniques, may help decrease the incidence and severity of FES.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-017-0463-y,,Cerebral fat embolism; Coma; Fat embolism syndrome; Magnetic resonance imaging; Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The frequency of nonrecognition is due to a lack of diagnostic criteria. In addition, the lack of evidence-based treatments has further complicated approaches to management. This case describes a patient who presented with a new-onset seizure and intracerebral hemorrhage requiring burst suppression and decompressive craniotomy to attenuate intracranial hypertension (ICH). The patient continued to display paroxysmal dysautonomia requiring a multimodal regimen for control of episodes. He demonstrated neurological improvement and complete resolution of dysautonomic activity prior to being discharged to a rehabilitation facility. A delayed diagnosis, ICH, and refractory PSH status postdecompressive craniotomy presented unique challenges. Given that the number of episodes of paroxysmal ""storms"" directly correlates with morbidity and mortality, early detection is critical, and lack of recognition makes this a difficult disorder to diagnose and manage.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.19086,PMC8610432,autonomic nervous system diseases; brain injury; dysautonomia; intracerebral hemorrhage; paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng

It is currently approved for partial seizures, and trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness against mania and chronic pain in adults. Psychosis is a rare side effect with an incidence of 2%. Our patient, a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of osteoarthritis and chronic pain only relieved by zonisamide is brought to the emergency department (ED) after a two-day history of altered mental status, agitation and visual hallucinations. One month prior, she had undergone total knee arthroplasty complicated with right knee cellulitis managed by IV (intravenous) long-term antibiotics of vancomycin and ertapenem. Physical examination was remarkable for disorientation to person, place, and time with intact remainder of the neurological exam. Initial laboratory work was unremarkable and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient was treated as ertapenem-induced with altered mental status and the antibiotic was switched to meropenem upon discharge. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED with similar non-resolving complaints. As the patient's symptoms didn't improve after ertapenem discontinuation, the decision was made to stop zonisamide and carefully monitor for possible withdrawal symptoms. Progressively, our patient had a timely resolution of symptoms with a full return to baseline within a week. This case demonstrates the potential severity of zonisamide-induced psychosis. Additional studies are warranted to analyze the mechanism explaining its neurological side effect profile.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.16400,PMC8363161,altered mental status; anti-epileptic drug; anticonvulsant; encephalopathy; hallucinations; neurological complication; neurological manifestations; partial seizure; psychosis; zonisamide,Case Reports,United States,eng

He reacted promptly to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. However, he experienced his first episode of hypomania after 6 months of antidepressant therapy. Adjunctive therapy with valproic acid and low-dose paroxetine was eventually added, resulting in complete improvement of both emotional incontinence and hypomania after 4 additional months of treatment.

It usually causes liver abscesses, which spread through the bloodstream to other parts such as the eyes, brain, lungs. 5.5% of all paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity syndrome are associated with infection, hydrocephalus, brain tumors, and some unknown causes. Younger patients with focal lesions of the brain parenchyma are at higher risk of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH). This case report details the clinical features of Klebsiella pneumoniae diagnosed in a healthy individual. In addition to liver abscesses, bacteremia, and hyperglycemia, there are also brain abscesses, hernias, and postoperative paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, an unexpected association between diseases or symptoms. The patient stabilized after comprehensive treatment, including early drainage of abscesses, rapid pathogen diagnosis, and timely and appropriate antibiotics. At a two-month follow-up, no signs of infection recurrence were noted, and the patient regained neurological function and could participate in regular physical activity. Symptoms of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection usually appear gradually, and misdiagnosis is common. When young patients suddenly develop high fever and abscess at a particular site, Klebsiella pneumoniae infection should be considered routine. Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity syndrome caused by infection is rare, but a clinical score (PSH assessment measure, PSH-AM score) should be performed when clinical features appear. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of infection in developing countries,10.3855/jidc.18686,,Klebsiella pneumoniae; central nervous system infection; invasive liver abscess syndrome; paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

32313749,Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Hypomania.,"Espiridion, Eduardo D; Mitchell, Cassandra; Kadakia, Shreeja",Espiridion,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a behavioral syndrome associated with various neurological conditions that typically manifests as uncontrollable laughing or crying. PBA can significantly impact the quality of life of patients affected as these spells can be inappropriate to the social setting or incompatible with the patient's emotional state. The underlying mechanism of PBA appears to be associated with disinhibition in neuronal pathways involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. One hypothesis for the pathology of PBA is that it is the result of disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar circuits, impairing cerebellar modulation of affect, and leading to uncontrolled emotional lability. Stroke, and other neurological disorders, interrupt these neuronal circuits causing disinhibition of the voluntary control of emotional expression. It is extremely important to recognize and appropriately diagnose the condition. We present a case report of an 85-year-old female patient who presented with a thalamic stroke, and she subsequently developed hypomania with symptoms of decreased need for sleep, mood lability, pressured speech, and religious preoccupation.

Delayed recognition of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) after brain injury may increase morbidity and long-term disability. Despite its significant clinical impact, the scientific literature on this syndrome is confusing; there is no consensus on nomenclature, etiological information for diagnoses preceding the condition is poorly understood, and the evidence base underpinning our knowledge of the pathophysiology and management strategies is largely anecdotal. This systematic literature review identified 2 separate categories of paroxysmal autonomic overactivity, 1 characterized by relatively pure sympathetic overactivity and another group of disorders with mixed parasympathetic/sympathetic features. The PSH group comprised 349 reported cases, with 79.4% resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI), 9.7% from hypoxia, and 5.4% from cerebrovascular accident. Although TBI is the dominant causative etiology, there was some suggestion that the true incidence of the condition is highest following cerebral hypoxia. In total, 31 different terms were identified for the condition. Although the most common term in the literature was dysautonomia, the consistency of sympathetic clinical features suggests that a more specific term should be used. The findings of this review suggest that PSH be adopted as a more clinically relevant and appropriate term. The review highlights major problems regarding conceptual definitions, diagnostic criteria, and nomenclature.

Pharmacological agents that have been studied in the management of this disorder include opiates, γ-aminobutyric acid agents, dopaminergic agents, and β blockers. Although paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is a relatively common complication after acquired brain injury, there is a paucity of recommendations or comparisons of agents for the management of this disorder. To evaluate all relevant literature on pharmacological therapies used to manage patients with paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity to help elucidate possible best practices. Of the 27 studies evaluated for inclusion, 10 studies received full review: 4 retrospective cohort studies, 5 single case studies, and 1 case series. Monotherapy is usually not effective in the management of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity and multiple agents with different mechanisms of action should be considered. α2-Agonists such as dexmedetomidine may hold some slight clinical efficacy over agents like propofol, and with respect to oral medications, propranolol might convey some slight advantage compared to others. However, with the limited data available, these results must be interpreted with caution. As the treatment of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is reactive to symptomatic evolution over time, critical care nurses play a vital role in the monitoring and treatment of these patients. Limited data exist on the management of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity and larger robust data sets are needed to guide decision-making.

Moreover, there still exists a shortfall in demonstrating specific clinical manifestations of the brain involvement of the virus. Here, we presented a 33-year-old female patient with COVID-19, reporting acute-onset paranoid delusions symptoms, insomnia and irritability. Cranial MRI showed an hyperintense signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, which might possibly indicate the presence of cytotoxic edema related to the brain involvement of the infection. Following the completion of SARS-CoV-2 treatment, both cytotoxic edema and psychiatric symptoms resolved. In light of this report, we suggest that either heightened immune response and direct viral infection that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to such psychiatric manifestations and neuropsychiatric monitoring should be performed in patients with COVID-19. Prompt recognition of psychiatric consequences of COVID-19 may help clinicians provide guidance for differential diagnosis and manage them accordingly.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2021.02.012,PMC7919506,Affective psychosis; COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Neuropsychiatric symptoms; Psychosis; SARS-CoV-2; Viral encephalitis,Case Reports,Scotland,eng
34395118,The Role of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Insular Cortex in Suicidal Memory and Intent.,"Parisi, Sara; Gunasekara, Ravindi; Canale, Cecilia; Hasta, Felicia; Azizi, Heela",Parisi,"Research on the brain regions involved in suicidal behavior has led to the identification of a number of regions as being implicated in the neurobiology of suicide. Some of the brain regions identified have a clear correlation between the levels of activity and suicidal behavior. For some regions, such as the insular cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), both hyperactivity and hypoactivity have been correlated with suicidal behavior. More studies are needed to characterize more clearly the activity of the insular cortex and ACC when it comes to suicidal behavior. The case report presented adds to the literature seeking to clarify the correlation between ACC and insular activities and suicidal behavior. Structural damage of the insular region and ACC, thus leading to a decline in their activity level, was found in a patient who had resolution of suicidal intent after hypoxic brain injury. We discuss the significance of our findings for the neurobiology of suicide.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.16335,PMC8357017,cingulate cortex; hypoxia; insular activity; suicidal behavior; suicide,Case Reports,United States,eng

On admission, the patient was dysphasic and had tonic-clonic seizures. Neurological examination showed mental confusion, euphoric mood, mania, paranoia, and mild motor dysphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed twice but no abnormalities were revealed. His acute confusional state, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein, epileptic seizure and electroencephalogram showing intermittent frontal slowness were all suggestive of encephalitis. The patient was treated with acyclovir without significant improvement in his condition. Testing for herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Limbic encephalitis was suspected and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for five days. Venereal disease research laboratory and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay were both tested positive in serum and CSF. Neurosyphilis was diagnosed, and the patient received a 14-day course of penicillin G with gradual improvement. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (anti-NMDAR) antibodies were positive in serum, confirming the presence of encephalitis. The atypical clinical presentation of neurosyphilis with symptomatology mimicking encephalitis and no MRI abnormalities made the diagnosis challenging. Coexistence of neurosyphilis with anti-NMDAR encephalitis has been reported only in one recent study.

29367224,The effect of a therapeutic lithium level on a stroke-related cerebellar tremor.,"Orleans, Rachel A; Dubin, Marc J; Kast, Kristopher A",Orleans,"Lithium is a mood stabiliser used in the treatment of acute mania, bipolar disorder and as augmentation for unipolar major depression. Tremor is a common adverse effect associated with lithium at both therapeutic and toxic serum levels. We present a case of dose-dependent changes in the quality and intensity of a stroke-related, chronic cerebellar tremor with lithium treatment at serum levels within the therapeutic range. On admission, the patient in this case had a baseline fine, postural tremor, which increased in frequency and evolved to include myoclonic jerks once lithium therapy was initiated. Although the patient's serum lithium level was never in the toxic range, his tremor returned to baseline on reduction of his serum lithium level. This case highlights that a pre-existing, baseline tremor may lower the threshold for developing myoclonus. It also suggests that caution may be warranted with lithium therapy in the setting of known cerebellar disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2017-222920,PMC5786966,drugs: psychiatry; mood disorders (including depression); psychiatry (drugs and medicines); unwanted effects / adverse reactions,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here we present a patient who experienced secondary mania while being hospitalized in a convalescent rehabilitation ward following cerebral infarction. The patient was a 70-year-old man who was hospitalized at our hospital for convalescent rehabilitation after suffering mild right hemiplegia and higher brain dysfunction following cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, the patient experienced a progression-free course. Upon awakening on day 26 after hospitalization, the patient suddenly showed signs of mania. The symptoms included elevated mood, pressured speech, hyperactivity, insomnia, and agitation; these symptoms caused problems in his daily life at the hospital. On day 29 after hospitalization, the patient was referred to a psychiatric hospital as an outpatient. He was diagnosed with organic manic disorder and was hospitalized. The patient was administered lithium carbonate (Limas<sup>®</sup>; 400 mg daily) and risperidone (Risperdal<sup>®</sup>; 2 mg daily). Because the mania persisted for more than 1 week, he was diagnosed with secondary mania. His manic state gradually improved, and he was transferred to our hospital. He was able to undergo rehabilitation without any problem and with no exacerbation of mania. The patient was discharged on day 139 after readmission. In cases where patients with cerebrovascular disorders display abnormal behavior, it becomes necessary to differentiate between secondary mania and social behavior disorder. Because mania has a negative impact on the patient's hospitalization and convalescence, if secondary mania is suspected, early consideration of psychiatric treatment is required.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Progress in rehabilitation medicine,10.2490/prm.20180021,PMC7365193,cerebral infarction; convalescent rehabilitation; late-onset mania; secondary mania; social behavior disorder,Case Reports,Japan,eng

Although there is documentation of this reaction in previous reports, very little is still known about the exact mechanism of action. In addition, there are no established guidelines of the next steps needed when a patient does develop this reaction. Therefore, this case report highlights what is known as well as the areas of research still needed. Our patient was a 57-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history of bipolar I disorder, opioid use disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, and Crohn's disease who was admitted to our behavioral health unit for suicidal ideation. She had been experiencing multiple panic attacks for 2.5 weeks along with poor sleep, increased energy, excessive spending, and feelings of helplessness. The patient was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, manic episode without psychotic features, and benzodiazepine use disorder. She was started on valproic acid, citalopram, propranolol, and quetiapine. By day 6 of her hospitalization, the patient had altered mental status, varying levels of consciousness, confusion, and ataxic gait. Her ammonia levels were found to be elevated. All of her medications were discontinued, and lactulose was initiated. She returned to her baseline mentation within 48 hours and was discharged with lithium and quetiapine. The treatment team concluded that this patient had valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy, a rare but reversible reaction to valproate. Fortunately, rapid identification of this rare condition led to a favorable outcome in our patient. This case report illustrates the course of treatment in a patient who experienced this reaction and reviews current knowledge as well as areas of needed research in regard to valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-020-2343-x,PMC6982381,Hyperammonemia; Valproate; Valproic acid,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To examine the impact of amygdalohippocampotomy upon symptoms and biomarkers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Two patients with well-documented chronic post-traumatic stress disorder who subsequently developed late-onset epilepsy underwent unilateral laser amygdalohippocampotomy.

After laser ablation targeting the nondominant (right) amygdala, both patients experienced not only reduced seizures, but also profoundly abated post-traumatic stress symptoms. Prospective evaluation of biomarkers in patient 2 showed robust improvements in hyperarousal symptoms, fear potentiation of the startle reflex, brain functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to fear-inducing stimuli, and emotional declarative memory.

While depression and delirium are frequent in cancer patients, hypomania during chemotherapy is rare. We describe a rare case of hypomania during S-1 plus cisplatin treatment for recurrent gastric cancer. A 66-year-old woman, with no previous psychiatric disorder, received S-1 plus cisplatin for recurrent gastric cancer. She showed peculiar behavior. Physical examination, urine, blood and imaging findings were normal. There was no gastric cancer progression. During psychiatric consultation, she behaved inappropriately. However, she behaved normally while performing daily activities. She manifested a persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood, clearly different from her usual non-depressed state, meeting hypomania diagnostic criteria. Her condition did not require chemotherapy discontinuation or additional medication. During the second and subsequent S-1 plus cisplatin cycles, symptoms were stable. Cancer patients often have adjustment disorders, depression and delirium, but rarely hypomania. Our patient showed no significant changes in blood biochemistry and brain and whole body imaging. While S-1 plus cisplatin-induced hypomania cannot be excluded, hypomanic symptoms did not improve during the chemotherapy rest period, nor was there deterioration during subsequent cycles, suggesting drug-induced mania to be unlikely. Possible onset mechanisms include manic defense phenomena, common with stressful life events. There are no reports of recurrent gastric cancer patients experiencing hypomania during S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin therapy, i.e. our patient represents a rare course. Clinicians should recognize psychosis or mood disorders during gastric cancer treatment. Further accumulation of such rare cases might elucidate pathological mechanisms underlying hypomania in cancer patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,10.1093/jjco/hys127,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

However, despite the increased rate at which mood disorders affect this population, there remains little information on management of these disorders. TBI has also been implicated in the development of Parkinson disease, increasing the likelihood that patients may be treated with dopaminergic agents. Management of coexisting pathologies can become challenging, especially when confounded by medication side effects. A case is presented of a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in a manic state 15 years after having suffered a closed head injury. Several psychiatric admissions during the past 2 years were noted, with various diagnoses including different iterations of bipolar disorder. Among his medications, levodopa-carbidopa was present for an unsubstantiated Parkinson disease diagnosis. His mania resolved after discontinuation of the agent. This case is presented with a review of the relevant literature pertaining to the use of levodopa-carbidopa in this context, the use of other dopaminergic agents, and a biological hypothesis for the potential increased likelihood of manic symptoms in TBI patients who receive levodopa-carbidopa.

The patient was treated with aripiprazole and benzodiazepine with poor effect and, after 4 days, the patient's condition significantly worsened requiring transfer to the intensive care unit where deep sedation with propofol was started. Our findings are in contrast with the traditional literature description of self-resolving and harmless mild encephalitis with reversible splenial lesion. Moreover, rapid clinical recovery and the progressive improvement of psychiatric symptoms after deep sedation with propofol in this case-considering propofol's neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects-supports the notion of propofol-mediated deep sedation for the treatment of severe manic symptoms associated with life-threatening conditions. Little is known about neural markers of the manic state, and the corpus callosum has been described to be involved in bipolar disorder.

Pain, swelling, stiffness, and hypoesthesia are observed as manifestations. The presence of a trophic ulcer is accompanied by a range of severe manifestations. The assaults occur in three distinct phases, namely vasospastic, plethoric, and erythema. Various approaches improve the overall well-being of a patient. It is possible to differentiate between primary and secondary Raynaud's syndrome, the latter being linked to systemic diseases. The application of botulin toxin is commonly indicated in several medical conditions including focal dystonia, spasticity with or without contractures, paraparesis in children with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, brain injuries, involuntary muscle hyperactivity of a non-dystonic nature, pain management, strabismus, nystagmus, sialorrhea, and esthetic medicine.

Identifying commonality in lesion localization in patients with PSH is challenging, but intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) represents a focal injury that might provide insight. We describe a series of patients with IPH that developed PSH, and review the literature. Patients with IPH who developed PSH were identified from OHSU hospital records. A literature review was conducted to identify similar cases through PUBMED, OVID, and Google Scholar. Three cases meeting criteria for PSH were identified. Hemorrhage volume ranged from 70 to 128 mL, and intracranial hemorrhage score ranged from 2 to 3. The laterality of the hemorrhage and significant volume of hemorrhage was similar in each of the patients, specifically all hemorrhages were large, subcortical, and right-sided. A literature search identified six additional cases, half of whom reported a right hemisphere hemorrhage and the majority also had subcortical localization. Our literature review identified six cases of IPH associated with PSH with five cases having subcortical lesion locations, echoing the areas of disruption in our three cases. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that injuries along the pathway from the insular cortex to downstream sympathetic centers may remove tonic inhibition leading to unchecked sympathetic outflow. Prospective investigations of lesion location in patients with IPH and PSH are warranted to test this hypothesis, especially with advanced neuroimaging techniques.",{},,Annals of clinical and translational neurology,10.1002/acn3.44,PMC4043289,,Case Reports,United States,eng

The most common causes of RESLES include infection, antiepileptic drug use and withdrawal, and severe metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, cases of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are uncommon. A 26-year-old female computer programming engineer with no previous medical or psychiatric history reported to the psychiatric hospital due to a 3-day episode of irritability, babbling, limb stiffness, sleepwalking, hallucinations, and paroxysmal mania. Brain MRI revealed abnormal signals of the SCC. Lumbar puncture was performed and further testing for auto-antibodies was conducted in both the CSF and serum. CSF of the patient was positive for anti-NMDAR (titer of 1:3.2) antibodies, and serum was also positive for anti-NMDAR (titer of 1:32) as well as mGluR5 (titer of 1:10) antibodies. Enhanced CT of the pelvis showed an enlarged pelvic mass; bilateral ovarian teratomas (mature teratoma and immature teratoma) were evaluated, which were pathologically confirmed after transabdominal left adnexal resection, right ovarian biopsy, and ovarian cystectomy. The patient considerably improved after intravenous administration of steroids, immunoglobulin, oral prednisone, surgical treatment, and chemotherapy. A follow-up MRI revealed completely resolved lesions. During a 3-month follow-up, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms without any sign of recurrence and tumors. The titer of the anti-NMDAR antibody decreased to 1:10 in serum. Herein, we report a rare case of AE with overlapping auto-antibodies, along with RESLES and bilateral ovarian teratomas. The current case provides the possibility of the concurrence of mGluR5 antibodies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Furthermore, we provide additional evidence that overlapping antibodies-related pathology may be one of the many causes of RESLES. Nonetheless, caution should be observed in interpreting the observation, considering that this is a single-case study.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1029294,PMC9878315,anti-N-methyl-D-aspartame receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis; anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; ovarian teratomas; reversible splenial lesion syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple strokes occurred in many elderly people. Among them, poststroke mood disorders such as depression are relatively common. However, restlessness with manic episodes has rarely been reported. We experienced an elderly patient who became manic shortly after recovering from COVID-19 infection, which turned out to be right-sided multiple strokes. The manic state improved as the strokes stabilized, suggesting that impaired blood flow was the cause of the manic symptoms. Primary mania increases blood flow in the left hemisphere, whereas right-sided strokes may relatively increase blood flow in the left hemisphere, which may have induced manic symptoms in this case. Multiple right-sided strokes after COVID-19 infection can cause mania, and the mechanism of poststroke mania needs to be investigated in the future.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain circulation,10.4103/bc.bc_103_22,PMC10419738,COVID-19; manic episode; multiple strokes; right-left imbalance of blood flow,Case Reports,India,eng

It presents with cyclic and simultaneous fever, posturing, and other symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity. Lack of diagnostic tests or biochemical markers and its propensity to mimic other common causes of fever in the neurotrauma intensive care unit (ICU) result in clinical dilemmas and management delay. We present a case series of four patients (two adults and two pediatrics) with TBI who developed PSH during ICU stay. These patients presented with fever along with variable symptoms of sympathetic hyperactivity. However, the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) was not elevated, and management of PSH was started. Serial monitoring of PCT helped in differentiating fever due to PSH from sepsis and thus the institution of appropriate and timely treatment of PSH and also helped to use antibiotics rationally. The use of serum PCT in differentiating sepsis from systemic inflammatory reaction and its role in the initiation and titration of antibiotics are well described. PSH is a common entity after TBI, causing episodic fever and sympathetic hyperactivity, often confused with infectious pathology. Our report proposes the role of serum PCT in differentiating PSH from infectious etiology and management of two different clinical entities. Bindra A, Chowdhary V, Dube SK, Goyal K, Mathur P.

There is a paucity of data about this condition in children. This study was planned to analyze the incidence of PSH among children requiring neurocritical care and its association with the outcome. The study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital over a period of 10 months. Children of age 1 month to 12 years admitted with neurocritical illnesses were included. Children who were declared brain dead after initial resuscitation were excluded from the study. The criterion laid by Moeller et al. was used for the diagnosis for PSH. During the study period, 54 children requiring neurocritical care were included in the study. The incidence of PSH was 5/54 (9.2%). Additionally, 30 (55.5%) children had less than four criteria for PSH and were termed as ""incomplete PSH."" Children with all four criteria for PSH had a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation, PICU stay, and higher PRISM III scores. Children with less than four criteria for PSH also had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and stay. However, there was no significant difference in mortality. Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity is common in children with neurological illnesses admitted to the PICU and is associated with longer mechanical ventilation and stay in PICU. They also had higher illness severity scores. Timely diagnosis of the condition and appropriate management is required to improve the outcome of these children. Agrwal S, Pallavi, Jhamb U, Saxena R.

Follow-up imaging of this opioid-associated amnestic syndrome (OAS) has revealed persistent hippocampal abnormalities. Given these observations, as well as neuropathological studies demonstrating excessive tau deposition in the hippocampi and other brain regions of individuals with opioid misuse, we describe longitudinal imaging of a patient with a history of OAS from presentation through 53 months later, when tau positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. Our patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorder, including opioids (intravenous heroin), who was hospitalized for acute-onset, dense anterograde amnesia. Her urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates. On presentation, her brain MRI showed restricted diffusion as well as T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity of the hippocampi and globi pallidi. On day 3, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a right hippocampal region of interest showed a mild reduction of N-acetyl aspartate/creatine, slight elevation of choline/creatine, and the appearance of lactate/lipid and glutamate/glutamine peaks. At 4.5 months, there was resolution of restricted diffusion on MRI, although a minimal anterior T2 and FLAIR hyperintense signal in the right hippocampus persisted. However, by 53 months, when mild memory loss was reported, the hippocampi appeared normal on MRI, and [ 18 F]T807 (tau) PET showed no uptake suggestive of tau deposition.

We also reviewed previously reported six patients with paroxysmal OTR. One patient showed contraversive torsional nystagmus during the paroxysms in association with vertical gaze limitation and vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus, which are consistent with baseline dysfunction and paroxysmal irritation of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) during the attacks. The other patient exhibited ipsiversive torsional nystagmus during the attacks, along with slowed vertical saccades and decreased amplitude of ipsitorsional nystagmus during the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex between the attacks. These findings are best explained by underlying dysfunction and paroxysmal irritation of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF).

32426021,A case report of mania with abnormal cerebral blood flow and cognitive impairment 24 years after head trauma.,"Yoshino, Hiroki; Aoki, Chieko; Kitamura, Soichiro; Yamamuro, Kazuhiko; Tanaka, Shohei; Kishimoto, Toshifumi",Yoshino,"Mania usually occurs secondary to organic etiologies such as head trauma within a short time of the primary condition's onset; however, there have been a few cases reported in the literature of long time spans before the manifestation of mania. The orbitofrontal cortex has been reported to be associated with manic states in bipolar disorder and with mania-inducing lesions. Head trauma commonly disrupts various cognitive functions, including attention and information processing. Traumatic brain injury patients have been shown to have greater posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus functional connectivity to the rest of the default mode network. We describe a case of secondary mania after head trauma 24 years ago with low blood flow in the orbitofrontal cortex, high blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex, and impaired cognitive functioning, including impaired attention and lowered processing speed. We describe a 30-year-old Japanese man with secondary mania and a medical history of head trauma 24 years ago. After head trauma at 6 years of age, the patient first showed apathy as a sign of frontal lobe impairment. After recovering, he experienced no psychiatric problems during adolescence, although he did show disinhibited behavior. At the onset of mania, low blood flow in the OFC and high blood flow in the PCC were observed as well as impaired cognitive function, including inattention and lowered processing speed. Abnormal cerebral blood flow was less prominent and cognitive dysfunction was partially recovered following recovery from mania, but his processing speed remained low. Although functional recovery from head trauma in childhood is better than that in adulthood, the brain may remain vulnerable for a long time. The risk of psychotic symptoms such as mania should be considered, even if sufficient superficial brain functional recovery is shown.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of general psychiatry,10.1186/s12991-020-00282-7,PMC7218518,"Brain injuries, traumatic; Manic state; Orbitofrontal cortex; Posterior cingulate cortex",Case Reports,England,eng

Catatonia is a common feature of the syndrome. The authors describe a case of recurrent delirium/mania with prominent catatonic features after a cerebellar and pontine stroke, and subsequent successful treatment with lorazepam. Symptoms quickly resolved after antipsychotics were discontinued, with continuation of valproate and lorazepam treatment. Failure to recognize this patient's syndrome as a form of catatonia could have had severe, even life-threatening, consequences. The use of neuroleptic medications in cases of delirium/mania with catatonic signs may result in marked clinical deterioration, whereas high-dose lorazepam can ameliorate catatonic signs.",{},,Psychosomatics,10.1176/appi.psy.50.3.285,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We aimed to describe the clinical features, diagnostic process, and outcome of 3 cases of anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R encephalitis in patients with a history of prior aHSCT for MM. A case series of 3 patients. Anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R antibody was tested at the University of Pennsylvania Laboratory. The patients were all male, aged 52 (case 1), 61 (case 2), and 62 (case 3) years at encephalitis symptom onset. The duration between completion of aHSCT and the onset of encephalitis was 43, 18, and 9 months, respectively. All 3 patients presented with new seizures and altered cognitive function. Other symptoms included headache and visual obscurations in cases 1 and 2 and intractable vertigo and mania in case 3. Brain MRI demonstrated nonenhancing multifocal T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery cortical and subcortical hyperintensities in all 3 patients. Cases 2 and 3 underwent brain biopsy before initiating immunomodulatory therapy, which demonstrated nonspecific encephalitis with astrogliosis in the white matter; these 2 patients were started on immunotherapy for the treatment of anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R encephalitis after 22 days and 3 months, respectively, from the first presentation. Case 1 was started on empiric immunotherapy within 8 days of presentation without requiring brain biopsy, given characteristic MRI imaging. CSF analysis demonstrated the presence of anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R antibodies in all 3 cases. Cases 1 and 3 also tested positive for anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R antibodies in the serum (serum test was not performed in case 2). Cases 1 and 2 recovered to work full-time within 1 year. Case 3 reported occasional myoclonic-like movement. We highlight the importance of considering anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R encephalitis in patients with seizures, multifocal nonenhancing brain lesions, and a history of aHSCT for MM. Awareness in recovered post-aHSCT patients with MM may be crucial because prompt recognition can avoid brain biopsy and delays in treatment. The rapid initiation of immunotherapy while awaiting autoantibody results will likely improve functional outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,10.1212/NXI.0000000000200024,PMC9417160,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The treatment of PSH is not well established. We present a case of a patient with multiple opiate overdoses who presented with altered mental status. He was diagnosed with catatonia and subsequently treated with ECT. His clinical condition worsened, and a revised diagnosis of PSH was established. The patient's condition improved with medical management. This case highlights the need to distinguish between these two related symptom clusters, as the incidence of DPHL and opioid overdose related neuropsychiatric problems increase.

11569896,Auditory laterality and attentional deficits after thalamic haemorrhage.,"Wester, K; Irvine, D R; Hugdahl, K",Wester,"Thalamic lesions have been shown to produce severe cognitive deficits involving language and memory. A majority of the studies have reported cognitive deficits after lesions in the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. We report five case studies of effects on language processing after postero-dorsal thalamic haemorrhages. Four of the patients had lesions on the right side, and one patient had a lesion on the left side. Effects on language processing were investigated with the dichotic listening test with consonant-vowel syllables. This test, in which conflicting auditory stimuli are presented simultaneously to the two ears, has been used to probe differences in language processing in the left and right hemispheres. The four patients with right-sided lesions reported almost none of the syllables presented to the left ear, and were unable to modify this massive right ear advantage by directing attention to the left or right ear. The patient with a left-sided lesion showed a weaker left ear advantage, and was able to modify his responses by shifting attention, to an extent similar to that of healthy reference individuals. When tested with monaural stimulus presentation, the scores of all patients rose to almost 100% correct for each ear. The pattern of effects with dichotic stimuli under different instructional conditions cannot be accounted for in purely structural terms, and indicates that lesions in the posterior part of the thalamus, including the pulvinar nucleus and medial geniculate body, produce deficits not only in processing of complex auditory stimuli but also in the allocation of attention to input from one ear or the other.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s004150170113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Brain imaging showed that multiple lesions in posterior circulation were involved in three patients. Although the prognosis of all patients was poor, PSH symptoms disappeared in all patients after endovascular treatment. These cases suggests that acute posterior circulation-related ischemic stroke should be considered with PSH occurring as the first symptom. Extensive disconnection due to multiple lesions in posterior circulation may play an important role in the occurrence and development of PSH.

We propose a syndrome caused by auto-immune reactivity triggered by molecular mimicry between VZV and the brain, culminating in a post-infectious psychiatric syndrome with childhood VZV infections. Two individuals, a 6-year-old male and 10-year-old female developed a neuro-psychiatric syndrome 3-6 weeks following a confirmed VZV infection with intrathecal oligoclonal bands.

Case 1 is a 79-year-old woman who became unconscious and suffered a large left mixed-type hemorrhage. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Two months postoperatively, she developed a high fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and decerebrate posture. After taking clonazepam, her symptoms improved, and she was transferred to another hospital. Case 2 is a 67-year-old man with right hemiplegia, a history of thrombectomy for left M1, occlusion and left carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic left severe carotid artery stenosis performed one year previously. Five hours after right corotid artery stenting, he became restless and hemiplegic on his left side. His computed tomography showed extensive cerebral hemorrhage in the right hemisphere necessitating emergency craniotomy. About a month after surgery, he had a high fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and decerebrate posture. Taking gabapentin improved his symptoms. Prolonged PSH may be a factor greatly impairing activities of daily living in stroke patients. It is important to diagnose and treat PSH early.",{},,No shinkei geka.

Although a contralesional release phenomenon has been implicated in post-stroke mania, empirical findings are lacking. We present a case report of post stroke mania. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was performed twice, during the manic state and during the remitted euthymic state. The first SPECT study performed during the manic state demonstrated hypoperfusion in the right temporal and frontal regions due to right putaminal hemorrhage. It also showed hyperperfusion in the inferior lateral prefrontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the medial and lateral parts of the parietal lobe in the left hemisphere. The second SPECT study performed during the euthymic state demonstrated moderate improvement in the hypoperfusion in the right fronto-temporal regions. Furthermore, compared to the findings on the first SPECT study, the second study showed that the focal hyperperfusion in the anterior insular cortex, inferior lateral prefrontal lobes, and superior-middle temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere had vanished. Increased left inferior prefrontal and anterior insular activity and reduced extensive right fronto-temporal lobe activity are involved in the development of post-stroke mania.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-12-68,PMC3482600,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The neurovascular cross-compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve by the contralateral vertebral artery tortuosity can cause VP.

24125463,[Natalizumab as induction therapy in multiple sclerosis].,"Corlobé, A; Charif, M; Mania, A; Outteryck, O; de Sèze, J; Labauge, P",Corlobé,"Current treatment options for first-line immunotherapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) are recombinant interferon-β and glatiramer acetate. However, these therapies are only partially effective and certain patients may fail to respond. For this reason, it is important to elaborate alternative treatment strategies. Induction therapy represents a more aggressive approach in which powerful drugs are used right from the beginning to tackle the disease process hard and early. Natalizumab is a powerful monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS and is known to silence disease activity. We describe here the early outcome at 1 month and at 6 months of three patients treated with natalizumab for relapsing-remitting MS. All three patients had a high disease activity before the initiation of natalizumab, with 4, 8 and 5 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain MRI respectively. On the MRI scans made at 1 month after the first infusion, and at 6 months, there was no more gadolinium-enhancement and no new T2-lesion. Clinically, they did not experience any relapse. In these three cases, natalizumab showed a dramatic efficacy: the patients became ""disease activity free"" right from the first infusion. To our knowledge, natalizumab is not classically used as an induction therapy, unlike mitoxantrone. However, this treatment has potential hematological and cardiac toxicity and its use can be limited. Thus, in JC virus negative patients, natalizumab could be an interesting alternative treatment. Our report suggests that induction strategy with natalizumab may be applicable in patients with aggressive multiple sclerosis.

The patient was an 11-year-old girl with secondary focal dystonia in her right hand. The dystonia was considered to result from a stroke lesion in the putamen due to vasculitis following varicella-zoster virus infection. We hypothesized that the infarction of the putamen resulted in hyperactivity in the thalamus, and, thus, performed a radiofrequency Vo thalamotomy. Markedly decreased muscle tone in her right hand was noted immediately after surgery. However, the improvement was temporary, as her symptoms returned to baseline level by the 6-month follow-up. Although the observed improvement was temporary in this case, our findings may elucidate the possible mechanisms of secondary focal dystonia.

The clinical and neuro-anatomic mechanisms that underlie the diverse locations of secondary mania are discussed. The cerebral components of secondary mania and disinhibition syndromes are very similar and it is proposed that disinhibition syndromes, secondary hypomania and secondary mania with and without psychotic symptoms are simply a continuum of severity of mood disorder and secondary mania with psychotic symptoms may be an extreme form. The concept of secondary mania in the elderly is not likely to disappear although several unresolved issues remain.

A 70-year-old patient first presented with behavioral disorder including hyperactivity, euphoria, with disinhibition and accelerated speech associated with severe insomnia and cognitive disorder. A manic episode was diagnosed and he received various psychotropic medications with no improvement. Invesitgations were negative (MRI showed T2 aspecific hyperintensities with no hyperintensities in limbic regions and EEG was normal). He was transferred to a nursing home, with a diagnosis of neurodegenerative condition. Later, he was referred to our unit for further investigations. A cerebral 18F-FDG-PET revealed an association of frontal hypometabolism and temporal and striatum hypermetabolism and CSF analysis revealed slightly increased white blood cell counts. Plasmatic anti-LGI1 antibodies were detected. The patient was treated with intra-venous immunoglobulin (IvIg) but showed no improvement. Second-line treatment (a combination of rituximab and cyclophosmphamide) was then administered for a year, leading to an improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms and normalization of metabolic impairment on 18F-FDG-PET. In this report, we describe a novel case of a patient withanti-LGI1 encephalitis with a predominant long-term psychiatric presentation. An atypical presentation (such as atypical psychiatric symptoms, neurocognitive disorder, and hyponatremia) should prompt further investigations such as CSF analysis, considering that MRI and EEG may be normal. FDG-PET might be of interest but few data are available in the literature. Early treatment of anti-LGI1 encephalitis is crucial for overall prognosis and may delay the development of dementia in some cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1168302,PMC10233061,FDG-PET; anti-LGI1 encephalitis; autoimmune manic syndrome; behavior; limbic encephalitis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Various myths embellish his various biographies. This is also true for his pathography: several articles written by authors from various specialties suggested him having suffered from psychiatric diseases, like cyclothymia or mania, and rheumatologic disorders, like arthritis, while others tended to interpret his recurrent palsies as typical sequelae of ischemic strokes. More recently, reports proposing lead poisoning as the main source of disease in Händel gained the attention of musical and lay press. During his last years of life, Händel was struck with blindness, which in his era had been interpreted as being due to cataracts. This led to three ""coucher"" operations, all of them without any lasting effect. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be proven from the original sources, the most plausible explanation for Händel's palsies and visual impairment may be based on one single context, i.e., cerebrovascular disease.

Hyperactivity of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is assumed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of OCD; however, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Several reports have described the development of OCD after traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the pathogenesis of post-TBI OCD remains unknown. Moreover, patients with TBI often have a variety of sequelae, including cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders, which make the diagnosis and treatment of OCD more complex. We report the case of a 17-year-old Japanese male who developed OCD after traffic trauma. The patient developed a fear of contamination and checking compulsion after injuring his right OFC and left temporal lobe when he ran into a running truck during a suicide attempt. We believe that the patient's fear of contamination can be diagnosed as true post-TBI OCD. However, his memory impairment was significant, and we considered his checking compulsion to be strongly influenced by cognitive dysfunction due to TBI. We attempted behavioral therapy for OCD; however, sufficient results were not achieved because of the interference from the sequelae of TBI. It is not rare for OCD symptoms to appear after TBI. Differentiating the OCD symptoms induced by brain injury or cognitive dysfunction associated with TBI is important to determine a treatment strategy.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,PCN reports : psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1002/pcn5.199,PMC11177174,cognitive dysfunction; obsessive–compulsive disorder; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

Because pathological generosity may lead to significant distress and financial burden upon patients and their families, it may warrant further consideration as a potential type of impulse control disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.826681,,Basal ganglia; Frontal lobe syndrome; Generosity; Impulse control disorder; Stroke,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
30098328,What bilateral damage of the superior parietal lobes tells us about visual attention disorders in developmental dyslexia.,"Valdois, S; Lassus-Sangosse, D; Lallier, M; Moreaud, O; Pisella, L",Valdois,"Neuroimaging studies have identified the superior parietal lobules bilaterally as the neural substrates of reduced visual attention (VA) span in developmental dyslexia. It remains however unclear whether the VA span deficit and the deficits in temporal and spatial attention shifting also reported in dyslexic children reflect a unitary spatio-temporal deficit of attention - probably linked to general posterior parietal dysfunction- or the dysfunction of distinct attentional systems that relate to different neural substrates. We explored this issue by testing an adult patient, IG, with a specific damage of the bilateral superior parietal lobules after stroke, on tasks assessing the VA span as well as temporal and spatial attention shifting. IG demonstrated a very severe VA span deficit, but preserved temporal attention shifting. Exogenous spatial orientation shifting was spared but her performance was impaired in endogenous attention. The overall findings show that distinct sub-systems of visual attention can be dissociated within the parietal lobe, suggesting that different attentional systems associated with specific neural networks can be selectively impaired in developmental dyslexia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.001,,Brain damage; Developmental dyslexia; Endogenous and exogenous spatial attention; Superior parietal lobule; Visual attention; Visual attention span,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

28953839,Antidepressants and Hyponatremia in a patient with Colectomy - a Case Report.,"Seshadri, Madhavan; Thalitaya, Madhusudan Deepak; Simon, Tuno; Odelola, Catherine; Enow, Humphrey",Seshadri,"Antidepressants are routinely used by General Practitioners (GP) as well as Psychiatrists to treat Depression. They are tolerated well. However, in certain patient populations, they are associated with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone Secretion) and Hyponatremia. Various research studies have shown that all antidepressants are associated with Hyponatremia. Hyponatremia as a side effect of antidepressant therapy is more commonly seen in old age, chronic Kidney disease and Hypothyroidism. Untreated Hyponatremia could lead to life threatening emergencies including Cerebral oedema, brain damage and coma. In this article, the authors discuss a 63 year old patient who suffered from Bipolar Disorder Type 2. He was treated with antidepressants (mainly Paroxetine) on and off for 30 years, without much side effects, until 2014. In July 2012, he underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis as a management of adeno carcinoma of Colon. In April 2013, Paroxetine was stopped as he was well. He developed first episode of mania in July 2014. This was managed with Olanzapine. However, he soon developed a Depressive episode and severe Anxiety. He was restarted on Paroxetine and the dose was increased up to 50 mg along with Olanzapine 15 mg per day. As he did not improve, he was switched to Sertraline with which he developed Hyponatremia. Further to this, he was tried on Venlafaxine and Lofepramine and he developed Hyponatremia with both of them. Considering the severity of Depression, he was started on Mirtazapine and the dose was titrated to 45 mg. With this dose his serum Sodium levels were stable but his Depression persisted. Fluoxetine augmentation at this stage by the GP led to another episode of Hyponatremia. Hence, he was started on Aripiprazole 5 mg as an augmentation agent. His Depression improved reasonably (though he did not remit fully). Recently, he has been started on Vortioxetine and the dose has been titrated to 15 mg OD and in addition, he is on Mirtazapine 45 mg OD and Aripiprazole 5 mg OD. His Sodium levels have been stable and his Depression has improved. This is the first time we have come across a patient with colectomy developing severe Hyponatremia. In this article, we have discussed possible reasons for Hyponatremia following colectomy and the management strategies that could help.",{},,Psychiatria Danubina,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Croatia,eng

She had concurrent hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. She suffered from central poststroke pain and reactive depression as poststroke complications, for which amitriptyline was prescribed. Unfortunately, she developed symptoms suggestive of mania and psychosis upon initiation of medications, which resolved upon withdrawal of amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is effective for treatment of poststroke pain and particularly useful in concomitant depression. Unexpectedly, this patient developed new psychopathologies after initiation of this medication. This case highlights the development of new psychopathologies that could be due to the antidepressant, underlying bipolar disorder or a complication of the stroke itself.

This syndrome is a clinical diagnosis based on the recurrent occurrence of tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, tachypnea, and occasionally high fever and dystonic postures. The episodes may be induced by stimulation or may occur spontaneously. Underdiagnosis is common, and delayed recognition may increase morbidity and long-term disability. Trigger avoidance and pharmacological therapy can be very successful in controlling this complication. Fat embolism syndrome is a rare but serious complication of long bone fractures. Neurologic signs, petechial hemorrhages and acute respiratory failure constitute the characteristic presenting triad. The term cerebral fat embolism is used when the neurological involvement predominates. The diagnosis is clinical, but specific neuroimaging findings can be supportive. The neurologic manifestations include different degrees of alteration of consciousness, focal deficits or seizures. Management is supportive, but good outcomes are possible even in cases with very severe presentation.

Single case report. A 22-year-old male patient presented with a 2-year history of manic and depressive symptoms. He was admitted to psychiatric in-patient care fulfilling sufficient criteria of bipolar disorder presenting with a hypomanic state. No neurological symptoms could be detected. Three months later, a MRI of the brain showed a hydrocephalus occlusus because of a space-occupying lesion of 5 mm in the lamina tecti obstructing the aqueduct of Silvius. The MRI also showed parahippocampal changes, which were probably related to the hydrocephalus. After the implantation of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, manic symptoms resolved, but the patient continued to suffer from adynamic symptoms. Follow-up MRIs over 3 years showed no progression of the lesion of unknown etiology. In this case, early routine neuroimaging might have reduced long-term brain damage.

Also termed autonomic storms, PSH can occur after a variety of cerebral insults, most commonly traumatic brain injury. Limited pediatric literature is available, especially in patients with brain injury from hypoxia. No consensus exists for the terminology, diagnostic criteria, or treatment algorithm for PSH. Thus, the optimal management, including medication selection and dosing, remains unclear. We present the detailed treatment of a 9-year-old, African American male with hypoxic brain injury after pulseless arrest following status asthmaticus, who subsequently developed PSH. The patient began to experience episodes of tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, diaphoresis, rigidity, and dystonic posturing on hospital day 5. After ruling out other potential causes, a diagnosis of PSH was made. Episodes of PSH failed to respond to lorazepam or labetalol but were aborted successfully with morphine. Management of PSH after hypoxic brain injury required medications for acute treatment as well as for prevention of PSH. Morphine was found to be highly effective and safe for aborting the autonomic crises. Other agents more commonly described in the literature did not result in an adequate response and were associated with significant adverse effects. A combination of clonazepam, baclofen, and either propranolol or clonidine aided in reducing the frequency of episodes of PSH. We suggest using morphine for aborting severe episodes of PSH that do not respond to antihypertensive agents or benzodiazepines.",{},,The journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics : JPPT : the official journal of PPAG,10.5863/1551-6776-20.4.335,PMC4557724,autonomic nervous system diseases; brain injuries; morphine; pediatrics,Case Reports,United States,eng
32754365,Cerebrospinal fluid fistula in a patient with chronic constipation related to an autonomic dysfunction and revealed by bacterial meningitis - A case report.,"Abboud, Hilal; Kharbouch, Hanane; Arkha, Yasser; Choukri, Mohamed",Abboud,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula represents a rare neurosurgical entity that can be defined as a communication between the subarachnoid space and nasal fossa or less commonly the ear cavity. It can be spontaneous without an evident etiology or secondary following a skull base surgery or trauma. The early diagnosis of spontaneous forms remains a challenge as clinical signs (e.g., unilateral rhinorrhea) can be absent or neglected by patients and can result in meningitis. Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old man with chronic constipation complicated by chronic intracranial hypertension, and resulting in rhinorrhea with bacterial meningitis. The etiological assessment of chronic constipation retained an autonomic dysfunction with sympathetic hyperactivity (e.g., pure autonomic failure) as an underlying cause. Beta-2 transferrin testing associated with cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan confirmed the diagnosis and localization of the fistula at the cribriform plate. The patient underwent an endoscopic endonasal approach with a repair of fistula. He presented with recurrent rhinorrhea 17 months later which required a surgical revision along with CSF diversion with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Although rare, autonomic dysfunction can result in chronic constipation in young patients, with intermittent or permanent intracranial hypertension, leading to CSF leaks. The early identification and treatment of the underlying etiology may prevent severe complications and improve the management and outcome of CSF fistula patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_147_2020,PMC7395540,Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea; Constipation; Meningitis; Pure autonomic failure,Case Reports,United States,eng

20866016,Consent to deep brain stimulation for neurological and psychiatric disorders.,"Glannon, Walter",Glannon,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna and subthalamic nucleus has restored some degree of motor control in many patients in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. DBS has also been used to treat dystonia, essential tremor (progressive neurological condition causing trembling), chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, major depressive disorder, obesity, cerebral palsy, and the minimally conscious state. Although the underlying mechanisms of the technique are still not clear, DBS can modulate underactive or overactive neural circuits and restore disrupted communication between and among groups of neurons in interacting regions of the brain.This can control and relieve many symptoms associated with a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. But the procedures of implanting and stimulating the electrodes are brain-invasive and entail significant risks. Some patients receiving DBS have experienced intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, cognitive disturbances such as impulsive behavior, and affective disturbances such as mania. It is not known whether continuous electrical stimulation of the brain would reshape synaptic connectivity and permanently alter neural circuits in ways that may not be salutary. The risk of these effects indicates that DBS should be used only when a patient's condition is refractory to all other interventions and when there is a high probability that the technique will benefit the patient and improve his or her quality of life. If a patient's quality of life is poor and all other treatment options have been exhausted, then the likelihood of benefit can justify physicians' exposing patients to some risk. The clinical and ethical significance of the risk in DBS underscores the obligation of physicians to obtain fully informed consent from patients undergoing the procedure.",{},,The Journal of clinical ethics,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Our experience emphasises the fact that limbic encephalitis is not easy to identify as most patients initially present with psychiatric symptomatology than neurological symptoms. Furthermore, immunological and laboratory testing takes a rather long time to determine the diagnosis. What is more, few psychiatrists consider autoimmune nature of the neuropsychiatric presentation.

He was then recommended to see a neurologist by his psychiatrist and underwent a series of investigations, which included the following: brain MRI with contrast, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) routine, CSF N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody analysis, and a CSF meningitis multiplex polymerase chain reaction, thyroid function, ammonia, lactate, creatine kinase, liver function, and metabolic screening of urine organic acids (UOAs), all of which revealed no abnormalities. Vitamin D was low at 38 ng/ml (>50). An electroencephalogram (EEG) done under standard conditions and provocative stimulation was abnormal with bilateral central and frontal discharge and more activity on the right side, revealing a background activity of moderately organized alpha waves (8-13 Hz) and bursts of sharp and slow wave activities that were accentuated by photic stimulation. Polysomnography showed poor sleep efficiency of 84.7%, and rapid eye movement (REM) stage was not reached due to interrupted sleep. He was then diagnosed with epileptic encephalopathy and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). The patient was prescribed sodium valproate, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and pulse steroids, with no major improvement, risperidone was added but was poorly tolerated, and the dose tapered off and eventually discontinued. Methylphenidate was the prescribed starting at 5 mg, and the dose was gradually increased to 20 mg/day given separately as 10 mg twice a day. A week later, melatonin 2 mg was added. Three months, later the EEG was repeated and was normal, and sodium valproate was tapered off and eventually discontinued. Later on that year, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and developed acute myositis as a complication, methylphenidate was stopped, and only sertraline and melatonin were continued. MRI was repeated only this time, showing evidence of viral/autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) sequela, and IV corticosteroids were given alongside IVIG. He was discharged on prednisolone, and a month later, major improvements were seen in all aspects.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.52133,PMC10855006,adhd; asd; autoimmune encephalitis; landau-kleffner syndrome; pediatric neurology; psychiatry,Case Reports,United States,eng

Right hemispheric brain tumors involving the orbitofrontal or basotemporal cortex are a rare cause of secondary mania. In such cases, early neurologic signs may be difficult to distinguish from bipolar symptoms. Breakthrough mania secondary to brain neoplasm in a bipolar patient stabilized on medication is an extremely rare phenomena which has not been previously reported. The clinical course of a bipolar subject stabilized on valproate who developed mania secondary to a right temporal lobe astrocytoma is described. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuropsychiatric evaluations were used to examine the relationship between the patient's brain mass and behavioral disturbances. Symptoms were those that accompanied prior episodes of mania. In addition, signs of temporal lobe dysfunction were evident including periods of detachment, déjà vu experiences, and olfactory hallucinations. In the context of mania, depersonalization was initially attributed to bipolar symptoms. Only several months later, when olfactory hallucinations and alterations in consciousness became evident, was a temporal lobe lesion suspected. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities responded to a combination of surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and topiramate, however the tumor was advanced and invasive at diagnosis resulting in a poor prognosis. This case suggests that clinicians examining unexplained cases of breakthrough mania should be vigilant for early signs of temporal lobe dysfunction, which could aid in detecting treatable lesions.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/00146965-200312000-00005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

A patient with subarachnoidal and cerebral hemorrhage was treated with pregabalin for neuropathic pain. Upon withdrawal of the medication she experienced spontaneous and painful supination in the right foot and internal hip rotation when standing up. When pregabalin was reinstituted, these dystonic symptoms subsided, but reappeared when the medication was again discontinued. One possible explanation for these symptoms could be neuronal hyperactivity within still-functioning pathways in connection with the motor cortex. Preponderance of activity in potentially compensatory structures could be suppressed by pregabalin: therefore, its potential benefit in subacute secondary dystonia in cases with orbital brain involvement is suggested.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-011-0737-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The psychopharmacological treatment of patients with acquired brain injury frequently includes numerous trials of psychotherapeutic drugs such as antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and lithium, in an effort towards affective and behavioural improvement. In this report we describe and graphically depict the striking efficacy of valproic acid in reducing and improving destructive and aggressive behaviours in five patients with acquired brain injury. In all cases valproic acid was effective after other pharmacological interventions were not. Also, the addition of valproic acid was followed by neurobehavioural improvement rather quickly, often within 1-2 weeks. Advantages of valproic acid, in addition to its possible unique efficacy, include a lower propensity towards sedation and cognitive impairment, and thus a more robust potential for rehabilitation participation. Behaviours associated with affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.

So far, few have been written for the association between parasitic infection and bipolar disorder. Filariasis is a parasitic disease acting ruthlessly via mosquitos and affecting more than 120 million people worldwide. We present here, to our knowledge, the first description of a filariasis infected manic bipolar disorder patient fully improved in terms of psychiatric symptoms by anti-heminthic treatment. The patient is a 31 years-old man native of Congo. At inclusion, he presented a severe manic episode with dangerous behaviour unresolved by classic treatments. A diagnosis of filariasis bancrofti infection was made after the discovery of a systemic hypereosinophilia. Therefore, a bi-therapy of anthelmintics was conducted allowing a successful improvement with clear reduction of agitation and aggressive behaviours that could not be attributed to a modification of psychotropic treatments or filarial encephalopathy or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The ineffectiveness of psychotropic treatment of a manic episode requires the evaluation of co-morbid medical conditions such as infections which can interfere with adequate mood stabilizing medication. Filariasis by inducing chronic inflammation and immunopathologic reactions seems to play a major role in infected affective disorders patients by changing levels of cytokines of the Th1 system or indirectly damaging the brain tissue. The beneficial combination of antihelmintics and mood stabilizers, in this case, could be explained by the potential of such association to downregulate neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity processes.Altogether, these data pinpoint the requirement to explore the parasitic infectious status in case of bipolar disorder patients resistant to classic treatments and originating or living in endemic geographical areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/1471-244X-13-81,PMC3623878,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A consensus set of diagnostic criteria named PSH-Assessment Measure (PSH-AM) has been developed recently, which is consisted of two components: a diagnosis likelihood tool derived from clinical characteristics of PSH, and a clinical feature scale assigned to the severity of each sympathetic hyperactivity. We herein present a case series of patients with PSH who were diagnosed and followed by using PSH-AM in our tertiary institutional medical and surgical ICU between April 2015 and March 2017 in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PSH-AM. Among 394 survivors of 521 patients admitted with acquired brain injury defined as acute brain injury at all levels of severity regardless of the presence of altered consciousness, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, infectious disease, and encephalopathy, 6 patients (1.5%) were diagnosed as PSH by using PSH-AM. PSH-AM served as a useful scoring system for early objective diagnosis, assessment of severity, and serial evaluation of treatment efficacy in the management of PSH in the ICU settings. In conclusion, critical care clinicians should consider the possibility of PSH and can use PSH-AM as a useful diagnostic and guiding tool in the management of PSH.",{},,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,10.1620/tjem.243.11,,acquired brain injury; critical care; dysautonomia; paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity; sympathetic storm,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

The first Italian report of a case of ""Binswanger's disease"" was published in 1958 by Donegani and Grattarola, who described a patient with a history of manic episodes followed by progressive mental deterioration. Pathological examination revealed changes mainly located in the hemispheric white matter, and the authors defined the patient as being affected by Binswanger's encephalopathy. Re-evaluation of this report indicates that the term ""Binswanger's disease"" has been applied to cases with non-specific clinical and pathological characteristics in the past.

The patient experienced 6 years of cognitive and mood decline, and his wife corroborated increasing memory loss, attentional difficulties, and depressed mood without suicidal ideation. He had been unable to maintain full-time employment because of progressive decline. Based on his presentation, he had been previously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder, type II. Neuropsychological tests indicated domain-specific cognitive impairment, and longitudinal volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed progressive brainstem, diencephalic, and frontal lobe atrophy. This regional volume loss correlated with the increased signal seen on tau and amyloid imaging (FDDNP-PET scan) of a separate case of suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Visual assessment of the MRI also showed evidence of old petechial hemorrhages in the frontal and temporal-parietal lobe white matter.

Most of the studies relating NSAs with psychosis are retrospective and only focused on the N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR). Our goal was to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against the NMDAR NR1 subunit (NMDAR-Abs) along with five additional NSAs in 61 first psychotic episode patients and 47 matched controls. We found two patients positive for NMDAR-Abs (3.3%). One of them was eventually considered to have been misdiagnosed and reclassified as encephalitis. The other met the criteria for bipolar I disorder, presented no neurological symptoms and had a comorbid HIV infection of vertical transmission. This is the first reported case of an HIV-infected patient with psychosis associated with NSAs. This study shows that patients presenting with clinically incomplete forms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, with predominant or isolated psychiatric symptoms, can remain undetected if no ancillary tests are performed. To improve patient diagnosis and treatment of individuals with a first psychotic episode, more detailed neurological examinations might be needed.

However, a brain tumor synchronous with immunosuppressant neurotoxicity has never been reported in a kidney transplant recipient. Herein, we report the first case of possible tacrolimus neurotoxicity with a meningioma manifesting as manic-like psychosis after kidney transplantation. A 63-year-old male presenting with acute psychotic mania was admitted to a psychiatric ward approximately 2 years after kidney transplantation. On brain magnetic resonance imaging, a tuberculum sellae meningioma was found, and hyperintense white matter lesions with possible tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity were seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Interestingly, the patient showed no visual field defects, and his blood tacrolimus concentration was within therapeutic ranges. After 3 weeks of adjunctive treatment with blonanserin, most of the symptoms had abated. The present case highlights the fact that neuroimaging studies are necessary to investigate underlying causes, as well as immunosuppressant neurotoxicity, which should all be considered when atypical psychiatric symptoms develop after organ transplantation. Further, this case suggests that the additional use of atypical antipsychotics while maintaining immunosuppressants may be effective for manic-like psychotic symptoms secondary to possible immunosuppressant neurotoxicity synchronous with a meningioma.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Annals of general psychiatry,10.1186/s12991-019-0242-6,PMC6727347,Immunosuppressant; Kidney transplantation; Meningioma; Neurotoxicity,Case Reports,England,eng

New onset of major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) post-concussion has not been investigated. BPD typically presents with an initial depressive episode followed by mania and concurrent depressive and manic states. Multiple theories explaining the etiology of BPD exist, including the diathesis-stress model (DiSM), though an accepted theory is not established.

New onset BPD was diagnosed one-year after a concussion following an involuntary admission and led to the patient self-terminating his medications and suffering a hypertensive crisis and aortic dissection, and stroke. One year later, the patient was again involuntarily admitted for a suicide attempt. Bipolar disorder persisted unchanged indefinitely. This case study may serve as a real-world example of the DiSM in the etiology of BPD post-concussion.

Carbamazepine offered only temporary relief, and relief from injections of botulinum toxin was insignificant. He was referred for surgical treatment. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of his posterior fossa contents revealed no obvious evidence of any compressive vessel along the facial nerve, but a compressive vessel along the hypoglossal nerve was apparent. The presence of preoperative tongue spasms encouraged interoperative monitoring of tongue motor responses. The facial nerve exit zone was explored, but microsurgical inspection of the seventh/eighth cranial nerve complex did not reveal any compressive vessel. However, at the anterolateral aspect of the medulla oblongata, the hypoglossal nerve was clearly compressed and distorted laterally by a large tortuous vertebral artery. When the artery was mobilized away from the nerve, the abnormal late electromyographic response to transcranial electrical stimulation disappeared; immediately after shredded Teflon was interpositioned between the artery and the nerve, the abnormal spontaneous tongue fasciculation also disappeared.

Excess serotonergic activity in the CNS and peripheral serotonin receptors results in neuromuscular hyperactivity, mental changes and autonomic symptoms. Hyperthermia is a characteristic feature of the syndrome. We describe neuropathological findings from two cases of lethal serotonin syndrome, both patients presenting with hyperthermia and neuromuscular symptoms.

They died, respectively, 10 days and 2½ months after the onset of serotonin syndrome symptoms. Post-mortem examination of the brains showed subtotal loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells in both cases. In the case with shorter survival time, areas with partial loss of cerebellar granule cells were observed, whereas in the case with longer survival time general and extensive loss of granule cells was found. Cells in other areas of the brain known to be sensitive to hypoxic injury were not affected. Selective loss of Purkinje cells has previously been described in neuroleptic malignant syndrome and heatstroke, conditions that are characterized by hyperthermia.

The rarely reported phenomenon of visual anti-extinction describes the opposite behavior, in which patients show greater difficulty in reporting a stimulus presented in isolation than they do in reporting 2 simultaneously presented stimuli. S. J. Goodrich and R. Ward (1997, Anti-extinction following unilateral parietal damage, Cognitive Neuropsychology, Vol. 14, pp. 595-612) suggested that visual anti-extinction is the result of a task-specific mechanism in which processing of the ipsilesional stimulus facilitates responses to the contralesional stimulus; in contrast, G. W. Humphreys, M. J. Riddoch, G. Nys, and D. Heinke (2002, Transient binding by time: Neuropsychological evidence from anti-extinction, Cognitive Neuropsychology, Vol. 19, pp. 361-380) suggested that temporal binding groups contralesional and ipsilesional stimuli together at brief exposure durations. We investigated extinction and anti-extinction phenomena in 3 brain-damaged patients using an extinction paradigm in which the stimulus exposure duration was systematically manipulated. Two patients showed both extinction and anti-extinction depending on the exposure duration of stimuli. Data confirmed the crucial role of duration in modulating the effect of extinction and anti-extinction. However, contrary to Humphreys and colleagues' (2002) single case, our patients showed extinction for short and anti-extinction for long exposure durations, suggesting that different mechanisms might underlie our patients' pattern of data.

The manic episode could have been secondary to brain injury and/or triggered by antidepressant medications. This case raises the possibility of the sensitizing role of brain injury for antidepressant-induced mania. Further studies are needed to assess the role of brain injury as a risk factor for antidepressant-induced mania.

In this study, we assessed autonomic function in patients prior to brain death. In 5 patients (2 women, median 60 years, age range 52-75 years) with fatal cerebral hemorrhage or stroke and negative prognosis, we monitored RR-intervals (RRI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation. Adjustment of mechanical ventilation remained constant. We assessed autonomic function from spectral powers of RRI and BP in the mainly sympathetic low- (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and parasympathetic high-frequencies (HF, 0.15-0.5 Hz), and calculated the RRI-LF/HF-ratio as index of sympathovagal balance. Three patients required norepinephrine (0.5-1.6 mg/h) for up to 72 h to maintain organ perfusion. Norepinephrine was reduced to 0.2-0.5 mg/h within 2 h before brain death was diagnosed according to the criteria of the German Medical Association. Wilcoxon test compared average values of ten 2-min epochs determined 2-3 h (measurement 1) and 1 h (measurement 2) before brain death. We found higher systolic (127.3 ± 15.9 vs. 159.4 ± 44.8 mmHg) and diastolic BP (60.1 ± 15.6 vs. 74.0 ± 15.2 mmHg), RRI-LF/HF-ratio (1.2 ± 1.6 vs. 3.9 ± 4.0), and BP-LF-powers (2.7 ± 4.8 vs. 23.1 ± 28.3 mmHg²) during measurement 2 than during measurement 1 (p < 0.05). The increase in BPs, in sympathetically mediated BP-LF-powers, and in the RRI-LF/HF-ratio suggests prominent sympathetic activity shortly before brain death.

The symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome can include hyperthermia, mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity and neuromuscular abnormalities, all of which can be concealed in the critically ill patient owing to concomitant therapies. The objective of this case report is to describe a probable drug-drug interaction between buspirone and linezolid, and to highlight the potential confounding effects of hypothermia in this case. We present a case of a 28-year-old man who potentially developed serotonin syndrome after coadministration of buspirone and linezolid while being therapeutically cooled for traumatic brain injury. The patient developed hyperthermia, hypertension and tachycardia when buspirone and linezolid were administered concomitantly for 2 days. Symptoms resolved within 24 h after discontinuation of both medications. Caution should be used in patients receiving multiple serotonergic agents in addition to therapeutic hypothermia. The use of therapeutic hypothermia may mask the symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome, thus delaying the diagnosis and treatment of this potentially deadly condition. If a patient requires the combination of such medications, close monitoring for the symptoms of serotonin syndrome is warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,10.1111/j.1365-2710.2012.01344.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

20600184,Impaired fixation to eyes following amygdala damage arises from abnormal bottom-up attention.,"Kennedy, Daniel P; Adolphs, Ralph",Kennedy,"SM is a patient with complete bilateral amygdala lesions who fails to fixate the eyes in faces and is consequently impaired in recognizing fear (Adolphs et al., 2005). Here we first replicated earlier findings in SM of reduced gaze to the eyes when seen in whole faces. Examination of the time course of fixations revealed that SM's reduced eye contact is particular pronounced in the first fixation to the face, and less abnormal in subsequent fixations. In a second set of experiments, we used a gaze-contingent presentation of faces with real time eye tracking, wherein only a small region of the face is made visible at the center of gaze. In essence, viewers explore the face by moving a small searchlight over the face with their gaze. Under such viewing conditions, SM's fixations to eye region of faces became entirely normalized. We suggest that this effect arises from the absence of bottom-up effects due to the facial features, allowing gaze location to be driven entirely by top-down control. Together with SM's failure to fixate the eyes in whole faces primarily at the very first saccade, the findings suggest that the saliency of the eyes normally attract our gaze in an amygdala-dependent manner. Impaired eye gaze is also a prominent feature of several psychiatric illnesses in which the amygdala has been hypothesized to be dysfunctional, and our findings and experimental manipulation may hold promise for interventions in such populations, including autism and fragile X syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.06.025,PMC2949539,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

15357324,Subacute necrotizing encephalopathy in a pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) that resembles mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans.,"Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle; Bellanca, Rita U; Crockett, Carolyn M; Curnow, Eliza; Eiffert, Kathy; Gillen, Maggie; Glanister, Debra; Hayes, Eric; Kelley, Stephen; Minoshima, Satoshi; Vogel, Keith",Bielefeldt-Ohmann,"A male pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), approximately 5 years old, was found to be vision-impaired and to have profound behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity and self-injurious behavior that was not amenable to amelioration by environmental enrichment. Facial and skeletal dysmorphisms also were noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning revealed areas of possible infarction in the occipital lobes and megaventriculosis. At necropsy, following euthanasia for humane reasons, severe polio- and leukoencephalomalacia accompanied by megaventriculosis were seen in both occipital lobes and in several sulci of the parietal and frontal lobes. Light microscopic findings included loss of neocortical structure, with necrosis, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, vascular proliferation, mild spongiosis, and demyelination. The extent and severity of lesions were most pronounced in the occipital lobes and were greater in the left than in the right hemisphere. Other lesions included mild bilateral atrophy of the optic nerves, thymic involution, necrotizing dermatitis due to trauma, and a spectrum of spermatozoal abnormalities. The imaging and gross and light microscopic changes found in this animal resemble the mitochondrial encephalopathies of humans; this was corroborated by results of immunohistochemical analysis demonstrating decreased expression of enzymes of the mitochondrial oxidative complex ([OC]-I, -III, and -IV) in brain and muscle, and detection of fibrinogen immunoreactivity in neurons and glial cells. The spermatozoal defects may represent yet another aspect of a mitochondrial defect.",{},,Comparative medicine,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng
6705320,Brain involvement in generalized argyria.,"Dietl, H W; Anzil, A P; Mehraein, P",Dietl,"Cutaneous argyria was diagnosed in a 59-year-old woman. Manic depressive psychosis developed at about the same or a short time thereafter. The patient died 6 years later from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. At autopsy silver deposits were seen in skin, mucous membranes, heart, kidney, and liver. In the central nervous system the leptomeninges and choroid plexuses contained silver granules. In addition, silver granules were visualized in the walls of many intraparenchymal vessels, particularly of the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. Progressive glial changes and cellular gliosis were evident in many areas of the brain. With the electron microscope the deposition of silver granules in basal membrane structures of the choroid plexus and intracerebral vasculature was amply confirmed. Furthermore, silver deposition was seen in brain parenchymal cells inside bodies of apparently lysosomal nature. The silver content of various brain regions was determined by absorption spectrophotometry.",{},,Clinical neuropathology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
8201801,An autopsy case of Binswanger's disease without hypertension and associated with cerebral infarction in the terminal stage.,"Iijima, M; Ishino, H; Seno, H; Inagaki, T; Haruki, S",Iijima,"We report here an autopsy case of Binswanger's disease (BD) without hypertension and associated with cerebral infarction in the terminal stage. The female patient, who was 74 years old at the time of death, had initially demonstrated manic-depressive disorder-like mental disorder, followed by dementia and neurological deficits. A brain CT scan showed white matter low attenuation bilaterally and symmetrically. BD was clinically diagnosed despite the lack of hypertension. In the terminal stage, she suffered an infarction in the left anterior cerebral artery region, and died of pneumonia. Neuropathologically, we found the infarction of the left anterior cerebral artery region, demyelination, fibrillary gliosis, lacunae and arteriosclerosis of the small arteries and arterioles in the white matter.",{},,The Japanese journal of psychiatry and neurology,10.1111/j.1440-1819.1993.tb01839.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

31082621,Persistent isolated mydriasis as an early sign of internal carotid artery dissection: Pourfour du petit syndrome.,"Sánchez-de la Torre, José Ramón; Drake-Pérez, Marta; Casado, Alfonso; Palacio-Portilla, Enrique Jesús; Revilla, Marian; Vázquez-Higuera, José Luis; Infante, Jon",Sánchez-de la Torre,"The dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is commonly associated with miosis in Bernard-Horner syndrome (BHS). The presence of mydriasis is exceptional but can occur in the context of Pourfour du Petit syndrome (PDPS), a rare entity opposite of BHS accompanied by eyelid retraction and hyperhidrosis and caused by hyperactivity of the sympathetic cervical chain. To report on a case of PDPS as the first manifestation of an ICA dissection. A 54-year-old man presented with isolated left mydriasis with no other abnormalities in the examination. Six months later, he suffered an ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory secondary to a left ICA dissection. The initial study with Intracranial computed tomographic angiography and brain magnetic resonance imaging ruled out compressive cause of the third cranial nerve or structural lesion in the midbrain. The absence of hypersensitivity to Pilocarpine discarded postganglionic parasympathetic involvement. In the presence of unilateral mydriasis and once common causes are ruled out an imaging examination of the supra-aortic trunks should be completed, since it could represent the first sign of carotid pathology in the context of PDPS.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2019.04.030,,Cerebrovascular diseases; Internal carotid artery dissection; Mydriasis; Neuroophthalmology; Pourfour du Petit syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
