9533994,Effortful echolalia.,"Hadano, K; Nakamura, H; Hamanaka, T",Hadano,"We report three cases of effortful echolalia in patients with cerebral infarction. The clinical picture of speech disturbance is associated with Type 1 Transcortical Motor Aphasia (TCMA, Goldstein, 1915). The patients always spoke nonfluently with loss of speech initiative, dysarthria, dysprosody, agrammatism, and increased effort and were unable to repeat sentences longer than those containing four or six words. In conversation, they first repeated a few words spoken to them, and then produced self initiated speech. The initial repetition as well as the subsequent self initiated speech, which were realized equally laboriously, can be regarded as mitigated echolalia (Pick, 1924). They were always aware of their own echolalia and tried to control it without effect. These cases demonstrate that neither the ability to repeat nor fluent speech are always necessary for echolalia. The possibility that a lesion in the left medial frontal lobe, including the supplementary motor area, plays an important role in effortful echolalia is discussed.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70737-8,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Rarely it occurs in seizure disorders as ictal or post-ictal manifestation. We report a case of epileptic palilalia in a 71-year-old patient with a previous history of intracerebral haemorrhage in the left frontal region, characterized by the continuous repetition of the same speech sequence for few minutes. EEG recordings during NREM sleep and wakefulness showed recurrent and prolonged focal subclinical epileptiform paroxysms in the left mesial frontal region. Our case confirms the role of the left frontal lobe, reliably of the supplementary motor area (SMA), as neuroanatomic origin of ictal palilalia.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2012.06.009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

She alternated between mutism with prolonged staring and posturing, and a state of agitation with elation and echolalia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was elevated and electroencephalogram showed mild slowing with bitemporal slow and sharp waves. We suspected catatonia secondary to possible autoimmune encephalitis but her condition persisted despite intravenous methylprednisolone. After identifying a positive serum anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) antibody, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, oral corticosteroids and rituximab led to gradual improvement. Patients with catatonia may show reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor density and there are two other reports of catatonia with anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> antibodies.

Several reports have noted that palilalia can occur in response to external verbal stimuli. Here, we report, for the first time, a patient with palilalia induced by gait, which we call ""movement-related palilalia."" Eleven months after the onset of cerebral infarction sparing the right precentral gyrus and its adjacent subcortical regions, a 63-year-old, left-handed Japanese man was referred for psychiatric consultation because of a complaint of irritability caused by the stress of compulsive repetition of a single meaningless word, ""wai."" The repetition of a word, palilalia, in this case, was characterized by its predominant occurrence during walking and by its melodic tones. The palilalia during walking disappeared almost completely after 5 months of treatment with carbamazepine 600 mg. Palilalia induced by gait can occur in patients with a history of cerebral infarction. This palilalia during walking may be due to the reorganization of networks in areas nearby or surrounding cerebral infarcts.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in human neuroscience,10.3389/fnhum.2024.1361585,PMC11252822,carbamazepine; cerebral infarction; hemiplegia; network reorganization; palilalia,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

At the age of 54, he presented with resting tremor in the hand and foot on the left, and gradual slowness in voluntary movements. Two years later, resting tremor involved the right foot, and an expressionless face and frozen gait occurred. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was made and treatment with L-dopa and carbidopa resulted in conspicuous improvement. At the age of 57, he developed compulsive repetitions of syllables, words and phrases, and sentences infrequently when he spoke. They have been persisting for four years. Repetitions increased in spontaneous speech while they decreased in oral reading and repetition of sentences. These repetitions in speech were symptomatologically diagnosed as palilalia and acquired stuttering. Brain CT showed slight brain atrophy, and brain MRI disclosed a few lesions indicating lacunae in the left substantia nigra, left putamen, and right internal capsule. SPECT showed a slight decrease in blood flow in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia bilaterally. Full IQ on WAIS was 105, and neither agnosia nor apraxia was detected. Palilalia and acquired stuttering, though the pathomechanism has not been clarified, have been reported to occur usually secondary to cerebral vascucular lesions and very rarely in Parkinson's disease. In the present case, they may have been produced by the parkinsonian nigro-striatal lesions. Alternatively, they may have been induced by the small vascular lesions demonstrated by MRI.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
29237665,Intermittent catatonia and complex automatisms caused by frontal lobe epilepsy in dementia.,"George, Robynne; Langford, Alex",George,"An 82-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department following bizarre behaviour. Police had noticed him driving erratically through his village. He did not stop when instructed, drove slowly home and appeared 'vacant' on questioning. While in hospital, he had approximately 15 episodes of catatonia, involving rigidity, negativism, mutism except echolalia and perseveration, automatic obedience and utilisation phenomena, lasting 2-20 min each. Between episodes, he was amnestic but otherwise well. Electroencephalography demonstrated bifrontal slowing with left-sided emphasis, and captured two focal onset partial seizures with the clinical correlate of the syndrome described above. He improved rapidly on levetiracetam and lorazepam, was discharged and received a diagnosis of dementia by his community mental health team shortly afterwards, based on chronic short-term memory loss, functional decline and MRI changes.

36680921,Anti-Gad 65 encephalitis with rapidly progressive temporal atrophy reveals the involvement of the temporal lobe in the neuroanatomical basis of palilalia.,"Zilioli, Alessandro; Misirocchi, Francesco; Pancaldi, Beatrice; Mannini, Elisa; Mutti, Carlotta; Zinno, Lucia; Florindo, Irene; Spallazzi, Marco; Parrino, Liborio",Zilioli,"Palilalia is an acquired speech disorder characterized by the reiteration of words or sentences, historically divided in two main subtypes: ""palilalie heterolalique"" and ""palilalie homolalique"". In the former, the reiteration is characterized by rate increase and volume decrease, while in the latter these features remain unaltered. While the ""heterolalique"" subtype has been mainly observed in the context of basal ganglia diseases, the neuroanatomical basis of the ""homolalique"" subtype has never been completely clarified. Here we report the case of an 81 years-old woman who developed an extremely repetitive and perseverative language with ""homolalique"" subtype features and a rapidly progressive course with severe bitemporal atrophy, as a consequence of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibodies encephalitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of palilalia in the context of anti-GAD 65 encephalitis. Through the support of voxel-based morphometry and hippocampal subfields analysis, this case study provides a fascinating way of understanding the networks responsible for palilalia, shedding some light on the critical role of temporal areas in the onset of this rare language disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2022.12.010,,,Case Reports,Italy,eng

The patient suffered from double vision, coordination problems including unsteady gait and atactic dysarthria, concentration difficulties, as well as adynamia and impaired decision making. The patient clinically presented a cerebellar and dysexecutive syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast enhancing ponto-mesencephalic lesion with a volume of 4.8cm<sup>3</sup>. Neuropsychological tests showed pronounced executive dysfunctions, reduced visuoconstructive skills, attentional deficits, echolalia, and non-fluent speech production. After cortisone and plasmapheresis, the cerebellar syndrome improved but manual fine motor skills and executive dysfunctions persisted. After three months, symptoms remitted except for a slight gait imbalance. After six months, neuropsychological tests were normal except for a moderate attention deficit. MRI revealed a clear regression of the ponto-mesencephalic lesion to a volume of 2.4cm<sup>3</sup> without contrast enhancement.

However, minimal information is available regarding patterns of non-credible language symptoms. We present the case of a 36-year-old female civil litigant who displayed delayed onset, severe, relatively focal speech and language symptoms, including difficulties with articulation, dysfluent speech, expressive language impairments with minor receptive difficulties, and lack of prosody, subsequent to a minor head trauma. On neuropsychological evaluation 3 years post injury, the patient presented with the same speech/language characteristics, but additionally exhibited a vague ""foreign accent."" Cognitive scores generally were normal with the exception of poor performance on many language tasks and processing/motor speed. The patient showed passing performance on most measures of response bias, but she failed effort indicators requiring rapid letter discrimination (b Test), rapid verbal repetition (timed forward digit span), and sensory function (finger agnosia errors) while passing effort indicators falling within the domains of memory, math/number skills, visuo-constructional ability, and attention. Thus, the type of failed effort indicators predicted the categories of standard cognitive tests on which she underperformed. Personality testing revealed patterns generally consistent with hysterical personality orientation. Given her long-standing history of multiple unexplained medical symptoms, the patient was diagnosed with a somatization disorder, as well as a current conversion disorder involving language symptoms. However, given her compensation-seeking status, the possibility of additional conscious feigning of symptoms could not be ruled out. The need for validation of additional measures to detect feigned language impairment is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1080/13854046.2010.481636,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

SPECT, which was performed after language functions returned to normal, displayed left frontal, cingular and insular hypoperfusion. The postictal language dysfunction of the patient corresponded to MTCA.

The combination of these two features due to a focal lesion has never been reported previously.

Secondary symptoms such as facial grimacing were absent. In contrast to acquired cortical stuttering which is characterized by a preponderance of sound and syllable sentence initial repetitions, dysfluency was more closely characteristic of palilalia.

In the group of 50 subjects, 20 showed two or more perseverations in one or more language tasks. No difference in number of perseverations was found between fluent and nonfluent subjects, but perseverations in global aphasic subjects with stereotyped speech were less varied than they were in fluent aphasic subjects and were not unlike other types of recurrent utterances. Of the two patients who received treatment, subject 1 had severe semantic disruption and perseverated in all production and comprehension tasks, except in repetition, reading aloud, and writing to dictation, all of which could be performed by the undamaged sublexical routines. Treated subject 2 had writing disorders that were ascribed to damage to the output buffer. She perseverated in all writing tasks. Rehabilitation of the semantic system in subject 1 and of the output buffer in subject 2 greatly reduced the number of perseverations in both subjects.

On admission to the rehabilitation department, neurological examination revealed mild left hemiparesis, hyperreflexia on the left side and grasp reflex on the left hand. Neuropsychologically she showed general inattention, non-fluent aphasia, acalculia, constructional disability, and mild buccofacial apraxia. No other apraxia, unilateral spatial neglect or extinction phenomena were observed. An MRI demonstrated resected areas in the right superior frontal gyrus, subcortical region in the right middle frontal gyrus, anterior part of the cingulate gyrus, a part of supplementary motor area. Surrounding area in the right frontal lobe showed diffuse signal change. She demonstrated non-fluent aprosodic speech with word finding difficulty. No phonemic paraphasia, or anarthria was observed. Auditory comprehension was fair with some difficulty in comprehending complex commands. Naming was good, but verbal fluency tests for a category or phonemic cuing was severely impaired. She could repeat words but not sentences. Reading comprehension was disturbed by semantic paralexia and writing words was poor for both Kana (syllabogram) and Kanji(logogram) characters. A significant feature of her speech was mitigated echolalia. In both free conversation and examination setting, she often repeated phrases spoken to her which she used to start her speech. In addition, she repeated words spoken to others which were totally irrelevant to her conversation. She was aware of her echoing, which always embarrassed her. She described her echolalic tendency as a great nuisance. However, once echoing being forbidden, she could not initiate her speech and made incorrect responses after long delay. Thus, her compulsive echolalia helped to start her speech. Only four patients with crossed aphasia demonstrated echolalia in the literature. They showed severe aphasia with markedly decreased speech and severe comprehension deficit. A patient with a similar lesion in the right medial frontal lobe had aspontaneity in general and language function per se could not be examined properly. Echolalia related to the medial frontal lesion in the language dominant hemisphere was described as a compulsive speech response, because some other 'echoing' phenomena or compulsive behavior were also observed in these patients. On the other hand, some patients with a large lesion in the right hemisphere tended to respond to stimuli directed to other patients, so called 'response-to-next-patient-stimulation'. This behavior was explained by disinhibited shift of attention or perseveration of the set.

He involuntarily repeated one syllable or a word five to ten times in spontaneous speech, repetition of phrases being not so frequent as that of syllables or words. This speech abnormality was considered as palilalia, which Souques first reported in 1908. The palilalia of this patient was rarely noted when he repeated words spoken to him by the examiner. As he spoke, the rate of speech gradually increased, the loudness reduced, and finally he began to whisper (palilalie aphone). The palilalia continued for four months.

Thus, there is a need to reappraise the broad spectrum of SLDs in PSP to include other presenting phenotypes. Here we report findings from the study of two elderly patients with PSP presenting with DA and irrepressible echolalia. Both patients had markedly impoverished verbal production, but their performance in other tasks (repetition and naming) and auditory comprehension were preserved or only mildly impaired. Experimental tests of DA revealed impaired word and sentence generation in response to verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Additional language and cognitive testing revealed different types of echolalia (mitigated, automatic, and echoing approval) as well as impaired inhibitory control and social cognition (mentalizing). Both patients had negative neuropsychiatric alterations (i.e., apathy, aspontaneity, and indifference/emotional flatness). Brain magnetic resonance imaging in both patients showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and superior medial frontal cortex suggestive of PSP, yet further evaluation of the neural correlates using multimodal neuroimaging and neuropathological data was not performed. However, based on the already known neural basis of DA and echolalia in PSP and stroke, we suggest that, in the present cases, neurodegeneration in the midbrain tegmentum, superior medial frontal lobe, and caudate nucleus was responsible for DA and that decreased activity in these regions may play a permissive role for eliciting verbal echoing <i>via</i> disinhibition of the perisylvian speech-language network.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,10.3389/fnagi.2021.635896,PMC8129544,dynamic aphasia; echolalia; inhibition deficits; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Report of two cases.,"Quigg, Mark; Geldmacher, David S; Elias, W Jeff",Quigg,"Assessment of eloquent functions during brain mapping usually relies on testing reading, speech, and comprehension to uncover transient deficits during electrical stimulation. These tests stem from findings predicted by the Geschwind-Wernicke hypothesis of receptive and expressive cortices connected by white matter tracts. Later work, however, has emphasized cortical mechanisms of language function. The authors report two cases that demonstrate that conduction aphasia is cortically mediated and can be inadequately assessed if not specifically evaluated during brain mapping. To determine the distribution of language on the dominant cortex, electrical cortical stimulation was performed in two cases by using implanted subdural electrodes during brain mapping before epilepsy surgery. A transient isolated deficit in repetition of language was reported during stimulation of the posterior portion of the dominant superior temporal gyrus in one patient and during stimulation of the supramarginal gyrus in the other patient. These cases demonstrate a localization of language repetition to the posterior perisylvian cortex. Brain mapping of this region should include assessment of verbal repetition to avoid potential deficits resembling conduction aphasia.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2006.104.5.845,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

8835045,Association of a Tourette-like syndrome with ofloxacin.,"Thomas, R J; Reagan, D R",Thomas,"To describe the association between the use of the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin in an elderly man and an unusual acute encephalopathy with characteristics suggestive of Tourette's syndrome. An unusual syndrome was observed in a 71-year-old man temporally related to the initiation of ofloxacin therapy that resolved completely after discontinuation of the drug. The most remarkable phenomena were spitting and profuse swearing; other features were echolalia, echopraxia, orofacial and limb automatisms, hypersalivation, and amnesia for the episode on recovery. The clinical syndrome had several features in common with Tourette's syndrome and possibly with frontal lobe onset complex partial seizures. The electroencephalographic, neuroradiologic, and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were normal. The reported neurotoxic effects of the fluoroquinolones include insomnia, seizures, delirium, and psychosis, best explained by the gamma-aminobutyric acid-antagonistic properties of this class of drugs. This is the first reported case of a Tourette-like syndrome associated with the use of any quinolone, suggesting a possible interaction with central dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Use of drugs such as ofloxacin that have improved central nervous system penetration, disease- or age-related reductions in renal function, concomitant use of drugs such as theophylline and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and possibly increased pharmacodynamic sensitivity place the elderly at special risk for quinolone neurotoxicity. Dosing modifications and an awareness of possible central nervous system adverse effects are warranted.",{},,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,10.1177/106002809603000205,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neurological examination revealed grasp reflex in the right hand and underutilization of the right upper extremity. An MRI demonstrated lesions in the left medial frontal lobe including the supplementary motor area and the anterior part of the cingulate gyrus, which extended to the anterior part of the body of corpus callosum. Neuropsychologically she was alert and cooperative. She demonstrated transcortical motor aphasia. Her verbal output began with echolalia. Furthermore hyperlexia was observed in daily activities and during examinations. During conversation she suddenly read words written on objects around her which were totally irrelevant to the talk. When she was walking in the ward with an examiner she read words written on a trash bag that passed by and signboards which indicated a name of a room. Her conversation while walking was intermingled with reading words, which was irrelevant to the conversation. She also read time on analog clocks, which were hung on a wall in a watch store. In a naming task, she read words written on objects first and named them upon repeated question about their names. When an examiner opened a newspaper in front of her without any instructions she began reading until the examiner prohibited it. Then she began reading again when an examiner turned the page, although she remembered that she should not read it aloud. She showed mild ideomotor apraxia of a left hand. Utilization behavior, imitation behavior, hypergraphia, or compulsive use of objects was not observed throughout the course. Hyperlexic tendency is a prominent feature of this patient's language output. Hyperlexia was often reported in children with pervasive developmental disorders including autism. There are only a few reports about hyperlexia in adults and some of them were related to diffuse brain dysfunction. Hyperlexia of our patient was associated with echolalia but not with the other ""echo"" phenomena, which may be because the lesion was unilateral on the left side. Dysfunction of the left supplementary motor area could lead to disinhibition of regulatory mechanism of verbal output in response to auditory and visual stimuli.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

When asked about their symptoms, the patients replied 80% of the time with ""yes, yes"", ""that's right"", or ""exactly"" to positive questions and ""no, no"" or ""absolutely not"" to negative questions, regardless of their actual symptoms and oblivious to self-contradiction. In addition, when the examining doctor was speaking to a medical colleague in the patient's presence and using medical terminology that the patient did not understand, he/she agreed or disagreed with any sentence and technical word uttered in a way entirely dependent on the syntax or intonation used. To distinguish this speech disorder from echolalia or verbal perseverations, with which it may be superficially confused, we suggest that it be called ""echoing approval"", as it may be part one of the manifestations of the environment-dependency syndrome. This clinical picture was found to be associated with features of transcortical motor aphasia and frontal lobe signs. One patient had a bilateral callosofrontal malignant glioma and the other a probable multiple system atrophy with global deterioration, pre-eminent frontal release signs, diffuse leukoencephalopathy and multiple lacunes. On the basis of these clinical deficits and neuroimaging features, we are unable to delineate the common, or minimal, lesioned network required for this symptomatology to occur, especially in the absence of a series of patients, and with such a difference in both the location and causes of the lesions. However, bilateral frontosubcortical dysfunction was pre-eminent in the clinical picture in both patients, even though more diffuse brain pathology was seen in one, and it might be speculated that dysfunction of the bilateral orbitofrontal and frontomesial motor frontosubcortical circuits might be involved in the aetiology of this peculiar speech disorder.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00878658,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

9699950,Impaired word-stem completion priming but intact perceptual identification priming with novel words: evidence from the amnesic patient H.M.,"Postle, B R; Corkin, S",Postle,"We hypothesized that word-stem completion (WSC) priming and perceptual identification (PI) priming, two types of repetition priming, rely on different cognitive and neural mechanisms: WSC priming on a modification mechanism that influences lexical retrieval, and PI priming on plasticity in pre-lexical perceptual systems. We compared the priming performance of the amnesic patient H.M. with words that came into common usage after the onset of his amnesia, and thus were novel to him (post-1965 words), and with familiar (pre-1953) words. We also tested age- and education-matched normal control subjects (NCS) and a patient with anterograde amnesia of recent onset (P.N.). The modification hypothesis predicted that H.M. would fail to show WSC priming with post-1965 words because pre-existing lexical representations of the test stimuli would be necessary for priming to occur. H.M.'s WSC priming score in the post-1965 condition did not differ from 0, and was inferior to the performance of NCS and of P.N. In contrast, H.M. displayed normal WSC priming in the pre-1953 condition. H.M. also showed robust and equivalent levels of PI priming in both conditions. A final experiment demonstrated preserved post-1965 word PI priming in H.M. when his baseline performance was matched with his post-1965 WSC priming baseline score.
