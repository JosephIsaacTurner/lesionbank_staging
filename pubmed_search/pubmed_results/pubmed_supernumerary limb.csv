28111302,Post-traumatic Visualized Supernumerary Phantom Limbs: A Case Presentation.,"Lamb, S Courtney-Kay",Lamb,"The experience of supernumerary phantom limbs (SPLs) is a rare phenomenon known to occur following a variety of neurological ailments. This case report details visualized supernumerary phantom arms and legs in a polytrauma patient with suspicion of seizure as the primary contributing factor. Fewer than 30 cases of SPLs have been previously described. SPLs are usually confined to the phantom proprioception/sensation of the limb, with only 6 prior cases reporting visualized SPLs, all of which occurred in the setting of isolated stroke. This case presentation is notable because it is the first to describe visualized SPLs in a polytrauma patient.

The phantom limb phenomenon, which is a delusional belief of the presence of a non-existent limb, has a particular fascination in neurology. This positive phenomenon of the phantom limb raises theoretical questions about its nature. After a stroke, some patients experience the perception of an extra limb in addition to the regular set of two arms and two legs. This complex cognitive and perceptual distortion is called supernumerary phantom limb.

34054464,Intentional Supernumerary Motor Phantom Limb after Right Cerebral Stroke: A Case Report.,"Yamada, Mai; Sasahara, Yoshimi; Seto, Makiko; Satoh, Akira; Tsujihata, Mitsuhiro",Yamada,"A 47-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation after right basal ganglion hematoma. On day 57, he noticed a supernumerary motor phantom limb (SPL) involving his right arm, originating at the level of the elbow. The most notable finding of his SPL was the motor characteristic. When the subject had the intention to move the upper paralyzed limb simultaneously with the trainer's facilitating action, he said ""there is another arm."" The intention to move the paralyzed arm alone or passive movement of the paralyzed arm did not induce the SPL. He showed a severe left sensorimotor impairment and mild hemineglect, but no neglect syndromes of the body (e.g., asomatognosia, somatoparaphrenia, personification and misoplegia, or anosognosia) were observed. Brain MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the right temporal lobe subcortex, subfrontal cortex, putamen, internal capsule, and thalamus. Single-photon emission computed tomography images showed more widespread hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere in comparison to the lesions on MRI. However, the premotor cortex was preserved. Our case is different from Staub's case in that SPL was not induced by the intention to move the paralyzed limb alone; rather, it was induced when the patient intended to move the paralyzed limb with a trainer's simultaneous facilitating action. The SPL may reflect that an abnormal closed-loop function of the thalamocortical system underlies the phantom phenomenon. However, despite the severe motor and sensory impairment, the afferent pathway from the periphery to the premotor cortex may have been partially preserved, and this may have been related to the induction of SPL.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513302,PMC8138257,Intentional motor phantom limb; Premotor cortex; Stroke; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Functional neuroimaging during SPL movements documented increased response in the ipsilesional supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), thalamus and caudate. This suggested that motor circuits are important for bodily related cognition, but anatomical evidence is sparse. Here, we tested this hypothesis by studying an extremely rare patient with chronic SPL, still present 3 years after a vascular stroke affecting cortical and subcortical right-hemisphere structures. Anatomical analysis included an advanced in vivo reconstruction of white matter tracts using diffusion-based spherical deconvolution. This reconstruction demonstrated a massive and relatively selective disconnection between anatomically preserved SMA/PMC and the thalamus. Our results provide strong anatomical support for the hypothesis that cortico-thalamic loops involving motor-related circuits are crucial to integrate sensorimotor processing with bodily self-awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-017-5044-y,,Premotor cortex; Supernumerary phantom limb; Supplementary motor area; Thalamus,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

We report a case of SPL in a patient with a right basal ganglia hemorrhage and review the previous literature about this peculiar phenomenon. Two days after the event of a right basal ganglia hemorrhage, a 78-year-old male reported a phantom arm protruding from his left shoulder. He could not see or touch the phantom arm but he felt the presence of an addition arm lateral to his paretic arm. Pain or sensory discomfort were absent in either the paretic arm or the phantom arm. He stated that he could intentionally move the phantom arm independent of his paretic arm. The examination showed that the passive movement of his paretic arm did not elicit any movement of his phantom arm. We diagnosed the SPL as a complication of the hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage and treated him with anti-hypertensive medications. His phantom arm persisted for 3 weeks, and it gradually faded away. SPL had been reported as a rare complication of various types of cerebral lesions. Right hemispheric lesions were most frequently associated with the SPL. Considering the intentional movement of the phantom arm, we deduced that the SPL might result from the impairment of the sensory feedback system for both internal body image and motor movement.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-017-0962-7,PMC5591514,Basal ganglia hemorrhage; Intentional movement; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

38453698,Visual hallucinations after resection of cerebral metastases: two patients with complex phantom images.,"Ovchinnikov, A; Andereggen, L; Rogers, S; Gschwind, M",Ovchinnikov,"Complex visual hallucinations are rarely seen in neurooncology. They are commonly observed alongside psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia or dementia, in Parkinson's or Lewy-body disease, after opioid medications or anesthesia, and, in particular, they appear with visual impairments. Here we report two normal-sighted and mentally healthy patients with unusual visual hallucinations after the resection and irradiation of brain metastases, the main features of which were persistent colorful and meaningful images with hallucinatory perseveration. These cases demonstrate the occurrence of complex visual hallucinations after resection of visual cortices as an effect of deafferentation, so-called visual release hallucinations or phantom images, similar to phantom pain after amputation of a limb. This case serves to heighten awareness in the radiooncology practitioner of the occurrence of visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome) related to multidisciplinary treatment of brain metastases.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

39064108,A Unique Case of Supernumerary Teeth Erupting Inside a Maxillary Sinus Osteoma.,"Kataoka, Toshiyuki; Amemiya, Kei; Goto, Toshiyuki; Kina, Hatsuki; Tajima, Erica; Okamoto, Toshihiro",Kataoka,"<b>Introduction:</b> Ectopic foreign bodies in the maxillary sinus occur rarely. Ectopic tooth eruption rarely occurs in the orbit, nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and elsewhere. Ectopic eruption of teeth in the maxillary sinus is most commonly associated with wisdom teeth and is rarely associated with supernumerary teeth. This rare phenomenon may be accompanied by chronic recurrent sinusitis with headaches and facial pain. However, fibro-osseous lesions in the paranasal sinuses are discovered incidentally on X-ray images and are often asymptomatic. Osteoma is the most common fibro-osseous lesion that develops in the paranasal and nasal sinuses. Osteomas rarely cause serious symptoms such as orbital lesions and intracranial invasion. <b>Case Presentation:</b> We report a rare case of exostosis containing supernumerary teeth within the maxillary sinus. A characteristic pedicled bone lesion with a clear border on computed tomography was the undefined orthopantomogram radiopacity in the maxillary sinus, and the lesion contained supernumerary teeth. As the patient had chronic nasal congestion, the tumor was surgically removed. Pathologically, the surgical specimen revealed an osteoma. The patient's symptoms of chronic sinusitis disappeared. Because the patient had no history of midface trauma or surgery, the supernumerary teeth were speculated to have migrated during a reactive osteogenic process caused by chronic sinusitis. <b>Conclusions:</b> A foreign body in the maxillary sinus can be easily diagnosed by computed tomography. Surgical removal is recommended if the foreign body is symptomatic or occupies more than half of the maxillary sinus. This can help resolve chronic sinusitis symptoms and prevent serious complications in the future.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of clinical medicine,10.3390/jcm13144067,PMC11277642,ectopic eruption; maxillary sinusitis; osteoma; supernumerary teeth,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

In patients after a stroke, a similar but rarely occurring phenomenon consisting of the patient experiencing the presence of an additional limb has been described. This phenomenon, generally called supernumerary phantom limb (SPL), may be caused by lesions in the right or left cerebral hemisphere, but has been predominantly reported in patients who have had a right hemispheric stroke. We report two cases of atypical SPL and phantom limb pain (PLP) after pontine hemorrhage. The patients were treated conservatively and their symptoms lasted more than 1 month. This is the first report of SPLs after left pontine hemorrhage, and phantom perception and pain lasted longer than those in previously observed cases.

The spare limb was not deformed; it could be moved and controlled by the patient, and there was no sensation of pain. The patient did not show psychopathological or cognitive disorders.

The illusion is most often experienced as a somesthetic phantom, but rarer SPLs may be intentionally triggered or seen. Here, we report the case of a left visual, tactile, and intentional SPL caused by right subcortical damage in a nondeluded woman. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the multimodal nature of this phantom, which the patient claimed to be able see, use, and move intentionally. The patient participated in a series of sensorimotor and motor imagery tasks involving the right, the left plegic, and the SPL's hand. Right premotor and motor regions were engaged when she imagined that she was scratching her left cheek with her left plegic hand, whereas when she performed the same task with the SPL, additional left middle occipital areas were recruited. Moreover, comparison of responses induced by left cheek (subjectively feasible) versus right cheek scratching (reportedly unfeasible movement) with the SPL demonstrated significant activation in right somesthetic areas. These findings demonstrate that intentional movements of a seen and felt SPL activate premotor and motor areas together with visual and sensory cortex, confirming its multimodal dimension and the reliability of the patient's verbal reports. This observation, interpreted for cortical deafferentation/disconnection caused by subcortical brain damage, constitutes a new but theoretically predictable entity among disorders of bodily awareness.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.21647,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
2390236,Unawareness of visual and sensorimotor defects: a hypothesis.,"Levine, D N",Levine,"A theory is proposed to account for unawareness of blindness, hemianopsia, and hemiplegia, and for phantom limb after amputation. It is assumed that interruption of a sensory pathway at any level--from peripheral nerve to primary sensory cortex--is not associated with any immediate sensory experience that uniquely specifies the defect. Instead the sensory loss must be discovered by a process of self-observation and inference. Discovery is easy for defects that create major functional disability, such as total blindness. Hence unawareness of total blindness occurs only in association with severe intellectual impairment, precluding the required self-observation and inference. In contrast, hemianopsia is difficult to discover because several mechanisms automatically compensate the defect effectively. Thus unawareness of hemianopsia is common, even in intellectually normal individuals. Insensate fields are often the source of suggested (false) percepts, because no information from such a field specifies the absence of a sensory stimulus. The most powerful source of suggestion is sensory activity in uninvolved portions of the affected sensory field. Thus hemianopsics may perceive complete geometric forms when only incomplete forms are shown and the missing portion falls in the hemianopsic fields. Such perceptual completion also occurs in hemianesthetic hemiplegics, creating the illusion that there are normally functioning limbs on the affected side. This perceptual completion increases the difficulty of discovery of hemianesthetic hemiplegia, but the disability is still sufficiently obvious that some additional cognitive impairment is invariably present in patients with lasting unawareness of hemiplegia. Phantom limb after amputation is the product of perceptual completion without associated cognitive impairment. The patient with phantom limb is thus aware of the illusory quality of his phantom. Some insight into the neural basis of perceptual completion and of unawareness of sensory loss may derive from considering sensory systems and associative cortex as parallel-distributed processing mechanisms.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(90)90052-p,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 46-year-old man experienced increased volume in the right maxilla, elevation of the nasal ala, and swelling of the hard palate with a reddish hue for 3 months. Computed tomography revealed an expansive hypodense region and cortical bone destruction associated with an impacted supernumerary tooth and an endodontically treated tooth. Under the differential diagnoses of a radicular cyst, dentigerous cyst, and ameloblastoma, an exploratory aspiration and incisional biopsy were performed. This revealed the formation of blood vessels of various diameters lined by endothelium, forming intravascular papillae positive for CD-34. The definitive diagnosis was IPEH, and the patient was treated by embolization and surgery. Histological analysis confirmed the presence of IPEH associated with an odontogenic cyst. After 12 months of follow-up, no recurrence was observed. Also, we reviewed case reports of IPEH affecting the maxilla and mandible. Fourteen intraosseous cases were reported in the maxilla and mandible, with a preference for males and affecting a wide age range. Complete surgical excision was the treatment of choice, and recurrences were not reported. The pathogenesis of IPEH is controversial and may originate from trauma or inflammatory processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an association of IPEH with an odontogenic cyst. The importance of IPEH in the differential diagnosis of intraosseous lesions in the jaws is emphasized, and preoperative semiotic maneuvers are needed to prevent surgical complications.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Diagnostic pathology,10.1186/s13000-024-01505-1,PMC11167849,Blood vessels; Hyperplasia; Mouth neoplasms; Odontogenic cysts; Oral pathology,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

In the present research, we tested two right brain-damaged (RBD) patients to find out whether changing the position of the hands in space influences tactile extinction and denial of ownership to the same extent. Results showed that manipulation of the spatial position of the hands reduces tactile extinction but leaves denial of ownership of the left hand unaffected. Such a dissociation suggests that delusional misperceptions may be independent from somatic neglect and that representation of hands in space and attribution of ownership are dynamically mapped in at least partly separate neural substrates.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490894020,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This study is unique in that cutaneous receptive fields related to specific cortical sites were defined by mechanical stimulation, as is done in animals, in contrast to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves at fixed sites, as in scalp EP recordings. Observations were made on pre- and postcentral gyri, on the second somatic sensory-motor area, on the supplementary motor area, and on the supplementary sensory area. In two patients with phantom limb pain, the pain was elicited in one on stimulation of the postcentral arm area, and in the other on stimulation of the supplementary sensory leg area. Surgical removal of these areas had the immediate effect of abolishing the phantoms and the pain. Long-term follow-up review was not possible.

A case report.,"Baron, R; Maier, C",Baron,"A patient suffered multiple fractures of the right leg and a left brain-stem infarction involving the anterolateral fasciculus of the central nociceptive system following multiple trauma. Later, the right leg was amputated, resulting in spontaneous and touch-evoked phantom pain and mechanical stump allodynia. However, quantitative sensory testing revealed considerable impairment of sensations normally mediated by cutaneous nociceptors and central spinothalamic systems on the right body side, including the stump but nearly intact touch and vibration senses. Quantitative assessment of peripheral nociceptive C-fiber function (axon reflex vasodilatation and flare) showed no abnormalities on both sides. Sympathetic blocks did not change spontaneous and evoked pain. Epidural and spinal anesthesia abolished evoked pain but had no effect on spontaneous phantom pain. Extirpation of a neuroma of the sciatic nerve did not alter spontaneous and evoked pain. TENS resulted in an increase in pain. We concluded the following. (i) Painful somatosensory memories that are responsible for phantom limb pain are located in the brain, most probably in the thalamus or cortex. (ii) Touch-evoked phantom pain and stump allodynia are not mediated by cutaneous nociceptive C and A delta fibers and spinal nociceptive pathways (spinothalamic tract). Activity in the lemniscal system (low-threshold mechanoreceptive A beta afferents, dorsal columns and medial lemnicus system) may be transferred to central pain signaling neurons in the thalamus or cortex resulting in touch-evoked pain sensations. (iii) Ongoing activity in cutaneous nociceptive C fibers and spinal nociceptive systems is not necessary to maintain central processes that account for spontaneous and touch-evoked pain sensations.

3362565,Disappearance of phantom pain after focal brain infarction.,"Yarnitsky, David; Barron, Stephen A; Bental, Ephraim",Yarnitsky,A patient with hemiplegia and hemihypoesthesia is presented in whom preexisting phantom limb pain disappeared with the appearance of a stroke localized by CT scan to the posterior internal capsule. Differentiation between the cutaneous sensation and the sensation of phantom limb pain that appeared later seems to support the assumed existence of a polysynaptic sensory pathway that conveys the sensations of deafferentation.,{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(88)90040-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
19681684,Response of malignant scalp dermatofibrosarcoma to presurgical targeted growth factor inhibition.,"Mattox, Austin K; Mehta, Ankit I; Grossi, Peter M; Cummings, Thomas J; Adamson, D Cory",Mattox,"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon, locally aggressive, malignant cutaneous tumor that sparingly presents on the scalp. Dermatofibrosarcomas often result from the formation of a fusion oncogene on translocated or supernumerary ring chromosomes 17 and 22, causing the overexpression of PDGFRbeta driven by the COL1A1 promoter. Because of uncertainty surrounding appropriate treatment of aggressive scalp DFSP, the authors performed an extensive review of the available data from a MEDLINE (Ovid) search to describe the clinical presentation and treatment options for this rare tumor. Their search identified 39 different cases, including the illustrative case presented in this study. Adjuvant therapy for this malignant lesion is not universally established in the literature. In the present case, the authors successfully treated a locally invasive scalp DFSP with presurgical therapy that specifically inhibited the PDGFbeta receptor. Imatinib significantly shrank the DFSP tumor mass, reduced hypervascularity, reduced metabolic activity on PET scanning, and permitted a safe gross-total resection. Although wide excision and Mohs micrographic surgery remain the standard surgical treatments for DFSP, the authors illustrate that presurgical chemotherapeutic treatment by imatinib provides a critical adjunct to traditional therapy.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2009.7.JNS09522,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
8761629,[The man with 6 arms. An analysis of supernumerary phantom limbs after right hemisphere stroke].,"Sellal, F; Renaseau-leclerc, C; Labrecque, R",Sellal,"Consequently an infarct in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery, a 77-year old man had a complete left sensory motor hemiplegia, with left neglect. For several weeks, he described the existence of one and more supernumerary phantom limbs. The patient's adamant and delusional conviction of their reality caused him considerable distress. Without being anosognosic he was not completely aware of his disorder, and had slight difficulties in judging what was plausible. The mechanisms underlying this delusion concerning specific parts of the body probably involve multifactorial disorders: first, a sensory deafferentation source of a distorsion of the perceived body schema; second, a resulting discrepancy between the perception of the body schema and its innate representation; third abnormalities of self-awareness and of self-judgement, leading the patient to argue forcellully in favor of incongruous rationalizations.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
9210989,Psychomotor agitation following gabapentin use in brain injury.,"Childers, M K; Holland, D",Childers,"Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant structurally related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was recently reported to be effective in pain associated with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and in pain associated with neuropathy. Yet, to our knowledge, the use of gabapentin for neuropathic pain in the presence of cognitive impairment has not been reported. In this report, we describe two patients (one with a traumatic brain injury, one with a putative acquired brain injury) who presented to a neurorehabilitation unit complaining of pain that was diagnosed as neurologically mediated. Within one week of receiving a daily 900 mg dose of gabapentin, both patients complained of heightened anxiety and restlessness. Correspondingly, each reported a diminution of psychological symptoms within 48 hours of gabapentin cessation. These two cases suggest that gabapentin may cause agitation in cognitive impaired patients. Physicians treating brain-injured patients and prescribing gabapentin for neuropathic pain may wish to closely monitor patients for similar signs of restlessness or anxiety.",{},,Brain injury,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
