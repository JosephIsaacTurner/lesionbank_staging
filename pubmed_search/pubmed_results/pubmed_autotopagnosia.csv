30661390,Anton's Syndrome associated with autotopagnosia.,"Lo Buono, Viviana; De Salvo, Simona; Paladina, Giuseppe; Corallo, Francesco; Palmeri, Rosanna; Morabito, Rosa; Bramanti, Alessia; Marino, Silvia; Sessa, Edoardo",Lo Buono,"We describe an unusual case of a 68-year-old male affected by cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical blindness associated with Anton's syndrome. In addition, our patient presented with autotopagnosia, a form of agnosia characterized by loss of body spatial representation. Neuropsychological assessment evidenced cognitive impairment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed hemorrhagic foci in the left occipital and right occipito-parietal lobe, paratrigonal white matter, and post-ischemic parenchymal gliosis. The pattern-reversal of visual evoked potentials were indicative bilateral visual pathway of integrity of the. After a neurological damage, patients could show a denial of their own deficit; however, the association between anosognosia and autotopagnosia represents a rare neurological condition. The simultaneous onset of unusual neuropsychological syndromes could be related to involvement of a complex brain network.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Applied neuropsychology.

2004260,Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia.,"Sirigu, A; Grafman, J; Bressler, K; Sunderland, T",Sirigu,"Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/114.1.629,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng
10683386,A category-specific deficit of spatial representation: the case of autotopagnosia.,"Denes, G; Cappelletti, J Y; Zilli, T; Dalla Porta, F; Gallana, A",Denes,"Following a vascular lesion in the parietal cortex of the language dominant hemisphere (right in one case), two patients showed a striking dissociation between spared naming, recognition and use of their body parts and an inability in localising on verbal command the same body parts on themselves and on a mannequin (Autotopagnosia, AT). The patients were submitted to a modified version of Reed and Farah Test (1995), a test that taps the ability to encode changes of body position as opposed to changes of position of objects. Their performance differed from normal controls, showing a specific deficit in encoding body position. It is suggested that AT could be the consequence of a lesion in a specific neural circuit, located in the language dominant hemisphere, whose function is to encode the body position for both oneself and others.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00101-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
37786739,"Invisible doppelgänger and body image disorders in right superior parietal lobule stroke, a case series.","Kumral, Emre; Çetin, Fatma E; Dere, Birgül; Özdemir, Hüseyin N",Kumral,"Autoscopic phenomena or an ""invisible doppelgänger"" refer to the illusory reduplication of one's own body. Body image disorder involves distorted perception or decreased body awareness. In the literature, feeling of presence (FOP) is rarely presented with a circumscribed cerebral pathology due to acute vascular lesions, and concomitant FOP and disorders of the body image or the body schema (BIBS) have rarely been reported. We present three cases of both FOP and BIBS disorders. All patients reported the two types of symptoms almost simultaneously: The first patient had the symptom of somatoparaphrenia characterized by deny ownership of the hand and feeling that it does not belong to her, the second patient had the sign of fading limb presented with misuse of his left hand when it was not under visual control and could not mentally represent and locate this part of the body in space, and the third patient had autotopagnosia; he was unable to localize any touched area below the elbow and knee. All patients had right parietal ischemic lesions involving the superior parietal lobule, and two patients had an adjacent additional precuneal involvement. Based on the cases presented here, it is plausible that BIBS may develop in addition to FOP, especially in lesions involving the superior parietal lobule and precuneus.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Ibrain,10.1002/ibra.12057,PMC10528960,asomatognosia; autoscopic phenomena; fading limb; invisible doppelgänger; superior parietal lobule,Case Reports,United States,eng
31330470,"You or me? Disentangling perspectival, perceptual, and integrative mechanisms in heterotopagnosia.","Bassolino, Michela; Bouzerda-Wahlen, Aurélie; Moix, Viviane; Bellmann, Anne; Herbelin, Bruno; Serino, Andrea; Blanke, Olaf",Bassolino,"Heterotopagnosia-without-Autotopagnosia (HwA) is characterized by the incapacity to point to body parts on others, but not on one's own body. This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.05.017,,Body recognition; Body-related disorders; Heterotopagnosia; Self-other distinction; Stroke; Virtual reality,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
17190753,A case of impaired naming and knowledge of body parts. Are limbs a separate sub-category?,"Laiacona, Marcella; Allamano, Nadia; Lorenzi, Lorena; Capitani, Erminio",Laiacona,"A left hemisphere stroke patient presented a disproportionate difficulty for body parts knowledge without autotopagnosia. The deficit concerned the lexical-semantic representation of body parts and was most severe for limbs. The ability to gesture was spared and action naming was not more impaired than object naming. On the basis of normal naming latencies, we conclude that limbs are the most vulnerable component of the overall category of body parts. This vulnerability is not explained by unbalanced nuisance variables. More cognitive effort is probably required for the appropriate differentiation of limbs during semantic processing and lexical access.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790601125940,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11992662,Is autotopoagnosia real? EC says yes. A case study.,"Guariglia, C; Piccardi, L; Puglisi Allegra, M C; Traballesi, M",Guariglia,"We report a case of pure autotopagnosia (AT) following a left subcortical vascular accident. The absence of any language disorder, general mental deterioration or other cognitive impairments in this patient allowed an in-depth study of AT. Several tests of body representation and object and animal representation, as well as tests assessing semantic skills were administered to verify current interpretations of AT. Results showed a clear-cut dissociation between defective performances in body representation tests and normal performances on tests involving other kinds of stimuli. The patient's performances were particularly defective on tests relying on visuo-spatial body representation, but her semantic and linguistic knowledge seemed to be spared. This dissociation between different aspects of body representation supports Sirigu et al.'s hypothesis that multiple, partially independent systems are involved in body knowledge. In agreement with this hypothesis, in the present patient AT seems be due to a deficit in a system that processes the structural properties and relative position of single body parts. The present results, reporting the first observation of a subject not affected by any cognitive impairment other than AT, strongly support the existence of a system specifically devoted to body representation.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00013-1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
7863178,[Apraxia and autotopoagnosia without aphasia or agraphia with compulsive language activity in right hemispheric lesion].,"Verstichel, P; Cambier, J; Masson, C; Masson, M; Robine, B",Verstichel,"A 75 year-old woman was admitted with a left hemiplegia resulting from an infarct in the right middle artery's territory. Her manual preference was ambiguous from early childhood. She presented with severe bilateral apraxia, autotopoagnosia, finger agnosia, and left spatial neglect. There was, however, no aphasia nor agraphia. When the patient attempted to perform gestures on order, she compulsively produced oral or written language. In this very unusual case, dominance for gesture and dominance for language were strictly independent, each ensured by one hemisphere. The patient's performances in gestual activities, especially dissociation between automatic and voluntary movements, and compulsive linguistic productions, are discussed in relation to this functional lateralization. We suggest that the propositional nature of the responses required in test conditions could activate either voluntary language in the left cerebral hemisphere, or voluntary gestures in the right. A competition between the two hemispheres could explain the patient's linguistic apraxic or behavior in response to orders. Autotopoagnosia, an uncommon symptom, could interfere with apraxia, but is not directly responsible.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

6718913,[Right hemiasomatognosia and sensation of amputation caused by left subcortical lesion. Role of callosal disconnection].,"Cambier, J; Elghozi, D; Graveleau, P; Lubetzki, C",Cambier,"A 72-year-old right-handed hypertensive man presented with a right brachial monoplegia, and hypesthesia of the right half of the body to touch and pricking, sparing the face. A CT scan 2 weeks later showed a spontaneous hyperdense area corresponding to a left subcortical parietal hematoma. The patient used his spontaneous language to express body image disturbances: intense prolonged feeling of amputation related to the upper limb and foot on the right side, hemiasomatognosia without anosognosia, autotopagnosia. Also associated were a right-sided visual negligence and a more general inability to handle spatial data leading to a temporospatial disorientation. Mild language disorders were suggestive of subcortical aphasia: normal incitation and repetition; with semantic paraphasias, poor verbal fluency. Furthermore comprehension of orders or propositions concerning spatial data were poor. Finally, there were signs suggestive of callosal disconnection: paradoxical extinction of the left ear during dichotic listening, agraphia and anomia of the left hand, ideomotor apraxia of the left upper limb, difficulty in visual transfer. The lesion interrupted thalamic tracts to parietal regions and callosal fibers linking parieto-occipital association areas. This twofold lesion was analyzed for each of the neuropsychological disturbances observed. Certain aspect of cerebral function in this patient were reminiscent of ""split-brain"" disorders. The left hemisphere which ""speaks"" fails to understand the feelings of the right hemisphere: unfamiliarity of places, sensations of illness, resulting in an unadapted speech. The pathophysiology of feeling of amputation is discussed.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre
