36708258,Narcolepsy secondary to anti-Ma2 encephalitis: two case reports.,"Brunet de Courssou, Jean-Baptiste; Testard, Pauline; Sallansonnet-Froment, Magali; Brechemier, Marie-Laure; Ricard, Damien; Psimaras, Dimitri; Ferrand, Mickaël; Maillet, Thibault; Depierre, Patricia; Ohlmann, Charlotte; Capron, Jean; Arnulf, Isabelle; Gales, Ana",Brunet de Courssou,"Recent studies suggest that sleep disorders are present in two-thirds of patients with autoimmune encephalitis. In anti-Ma2 encephalitis, hypersomnia appears to be frequent. However, only few cases of type 1 narcolepsy have been reported to date with anti-Ma2 encephalitis. We report 2 new cases of patients with narcolepsy secondary to anti-Ma2 encephalitis. Patient 1, a 68-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 1, including sleep attacks, cataplexy, abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests and hypocretin-1 deficiency (< 50 ng/L) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), associated with a cerebellar syndrome. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF and antivoltage-gated potassium channel antibodies in the serum. He benefited from a treatment with pitolisant. Patient 2, a 42-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 2, including hypersomnolence, no cataplexy, intermediate CSF levels of hypocretin-1 (138 ng/L), abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, and a limbic encephalitis presentation. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF, and anti-Ma1 antibodies were in the CSF. For both, repeated polysomnographies were necessary to establish the precise diagnosis of central hypersomnia, emphasizing the importance of carrying out sleep investigations in a tertiary neurology center with sleep medicine expertise in patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

32664104,Case report: narcolepsy type 2 due to temporal lobe glioma.,"Liao, Yuangao; He, Yan; Yang, You; Li, Xiaojie; Huang, Fengzhen",Liao,"The orexin projection system includes the lateral hypothalamus, reticular activating structure, and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, and this system is related to the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe. A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more. The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out. General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications. We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3). The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area. The hippocampus might be another part of regulating the sleep-arousal pathway, and the glioma secretion might interact with the orexin projection system.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000021002,PMC7360319,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31961221,Symptomatic Narcolepsy/Cataplexy in a Dog with Brainstem Meningoencephalitis of Unknown Origin.,"Mari, Lorenzo; Shea, Anita",Mari,"<b>A 4 yr old, intact female cocker spaniel was presented for investigation of acute, progressive lethargy/hypersomnia; vestibular signs; and cataplexy. A narcolepsy-cataplexy episode with associated hypertension and bradycardia was triggered during examination. There was no evidence of arrhythmia on electrocardiography during the episode. Hematology, serum biochemistry, and thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable. MRI of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were compatible with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affecting the mesencephalon, pons and rostral medulla oblongata. The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities. Although very rare, symptomatic narcolepsy/cataplexy can occur in dogs and can be secondary to brainstem encephalitis. Cardiovascular changes can occur in association with narcolepsy/cataplexy and should be considered when dealing with patients presenting with these specific clinical signs.</b>","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association,10.5326/JAAHA-MS-6892,,CSF (cerebrospinal fluid); MUO (meningoencephalitis of unknown origin); REM (rapid eye movement),Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
22136879,[Hypothalamic involvement in multiple sclerosis].,"Darlix, A; Mathey, G; Monin, M-L; Sauvée, M; Braun, M; Schaff, J-L; Debouverie, M",Darlix,"Hypothalamic involvement is a rare condition in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report two patients with a long history of MS who presented with severe acute hypothermia with associated thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase levels. Several cases of hypothermia or hyperthermia in patients with MS have been reported in the literature. They could be linked with hypothalamic lesions, in particular in the pre-optic area. However, other anatomical locations seem to be involved in thermoregulation and can be affected by MS. Besides, some cases of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion have been reported in patients with MS. Finally, some sleep disorders, particularly hypersomnia or narcolepsy, could be related to hypothalamic lesions, through the fall in hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Hypocretin-1 is a neuropeptide that is secreted by some hypothalamic cells. It plays a role in the sleep-awake rhythm. We report one patient with narcolepsy and cataplexy before the first symptoms of MS appeared. Hypothalamic signs are rare in MS. However, several series of autopsies have shown a high frequency of demyelinating lesions in the hypothalamic area. Among these lesions, the proportion of active lesions seems elevated. Yet only few of them have a clinical or biological translation such as thermoregulation dysfunction, sleep disorders or natremia abnormalities. Thus, it seems unlikely that inflammatory hypothalamic lesions alone, even when bilateral, could be the explanation of these signs. A sufficient number of inflammatory demyelinating lesions, which we can observe in patients with a long history of MS and an already severe disability, is probably necessary to develop such a rare symptomatology. Hypothalamic signs might be a factor of poor prognosis for the disease course and progression of the disability.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2011.09.004,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

We describe the case of a 43-year-old man who presented with ongoing headache. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed subdural haematoma in the left fronto-temporo-parietal region, without subarachnoid haemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography showed an aneurysm measuring ≤ 5 mm in diameter, arising from the distal region of the left middle cerebral artery. During hospitalization, an acute change in mental status accompanied by slurred speech and narcolepsy prompted an emergency CT scan. This revealed an enlargement of the subdural haematoma. The patient underwent an emergency craniotomy, during which a large amount of bloody fluid was evacuated, and the aneurysm was coagulated and resected.

9351130,MRI findings in narcolepsy.,"Bassetti, C; Aldrich, M S; Quint, D J",Bassetti,"The neuropathology of narcolepsy is unknown. Recently, Plazzi et al. (1) reported magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the pontine tegmentum of three patients with long-standing idiopathic narcolepsy. Considering the localization of the neuroradiological findings in the pontine reticular formation, where rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is generated, the authors suggested a causal relationship between narcolepsy and MRI abnormalities. Frey and Heiserman, however, found pontine MRI abnormalities in only two of 12 patients with narcolepsy both of whom had long-standing hypertension (2). Pullicino et al. noted similar pontine MRI abnormalities in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy-like ischemic rarefaction of the pons (3). Thus, the changes noted by Plazzi et al. may have been caused by small-vessel disease rather than narcolepsy. To assess whether altered pontine MRI signals are a regular feature of idiopathic narcolepsy, we selected randomly from our database seven patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Of these seven, three agreed to have brain MRIs; their cases are described below.

1759095,Sleep-related eating disorders: polysomnographic correlates of a heterogeneous syndrome distinct from daytime eating disorders.,"Schenck, C H; Hurwitz, T D; Bundlie, S R; Mahowald, M W",Schenck,"Over a 5-yr period, 19 adults presented to our sleep disorders center with histories of involuntary, nocturnal, sleep-related eating that usually occurred with other problematic nocturnal behaviors. Mean age (+/- SD) at presentation was 37.4 (+/- 9.1) yr (range 18-54); 73.7% of the patients (n = 14) were female. Mean age of sleep-related eating onset was 24.7 (+/- 12.9) yr (range 5-44). Eating occurred from sleep nightly in 57.9% (n = 11) of patients. Chief complaints included excessive weight gain, concerns about choking while eating or about starting fires from cooking and sleep disruption. Extensive polysomnographic studies, clinical evaluations and treatment outcome data identified three etiologic categories for the sleep-related eating: (a) sleepwalking (SW), 84.2% (n = 16); (b) periodic movements of sleep (PMS), 10.5% (n = 2) and (c) triazolam abuse (0.75 mg hs), 5.3% (n = 1). DSM-III Axis 1 psychiatric disorders (affective, anxiety) were present in 47.4% (n = 9) of the patients, and only two patients had a daytime eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), each in remission for 3-7 yr. Nearly half of all patients fulfilled established criteria for being overweight, based on the body mass index. Onset of sleep-related eating was linked directly to the onset of SW, PMS, triazolam abuse, nicotine abstinence, chronic autoimmune hepatitis, narcolepsy, encephalitis or acute stress. In the SW group, 72.7% (8/11) of patients had nocturnal eating and other SW behavior suppressed by clonazepam (n = 7) and/or bromocriptine (n = 2) treatment. Both patients with PMS likewise responded to treatment with combinations of carbidopa/L-dopa, codeine and clonazepam. Thus, sleep-related eating disorders can generally be controlled with treatment of the underlying sleep disorder.",{},,Sleep,10.1093/sleep/14.5.419,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

8707478,Resolution of partial cataplexy in multiple sclerosis by treatment with weak electromagnetic fields.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Cataplexy, an ancillary symptom of narcolepsy, involves the sudden loss of muscle tone without altered consciousness usually brought on by sudden excitement or emotional influence and extreme exertions (Guilleminault et al., 1974; Parks et al., 1974; Guilleminault, 1976; Aldrich, 1992; 1993; Scrima, 1981; Baker, 1985). Attacks of generalized cataplexy produce complete atonic, areflexic partial or complete paralysis of striated muscles commonly involving the leg muscles resulting in collapse of the knees and falling while milder forms often termed partial cataplexy may manifest by sagging of the face, eyelid, or jaw, dysarthria, blurred vision, drooping of the head, weakness of an arm or leg, buckling at the knees, or simply a momentary sensation of weakness that is imperceptible to observers (Guilleminault, 1976; Aldrich, 1993). The duration of cataplexy is usually a few seconds, although severe episodes can last several minutes and rarely several hours or days in the case of ""status cataplecticus"" (Parkes et al., 1974; Guilleminault, 1976; Billiard & Cadilhac, 1985; Aldrich, 1992; 1993).

By definition secondary disorders of awakening are due to clearly identified causes of various origins. Two main types of secondary disorders of awakening have been distinguished: those depending on more or less voluntary sleep curtailment or on psychotropic or non psychotropic medications and those consecutive to different disorders, respiratory, neurologic, traumatic, psychotropic, infectious, metabolic, endocrinologic, and insomnia. Some of these disorders, frequent or very frequent, are polysomnographically investigated, night and day, enabling to assess in each case the type and severity of sleepiness. Others are only clinically evaluated.

We describe a 38-year-old woman with severe daytime sleepiness, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and bilateral delayed visual evoked potentials. Her multiple sleep latency test results demonstrated short sleep latencies and 4 sleep-onset rapid eye movement sleep periods, and her cerebrospinal fluid contained a low concentration of hypocretin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity along the walls of the third ventricle and aqueduct, which are consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. After treatment with steroids, this patient's subjective sleepiness, hypersomnia, and hypocretin deficiency partially improved. Autoimmune diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can produce narcolepsy.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy was made based on hypnagogic hallucination, sleep paralysis, changes of personality and the sleep onset sREM (SOREM). The elevation of anti-measles antibody and a positive oligoclonal band in CSF, low density areas in the bilateral internal capsule on CT scan, and high signal areas in the same region on T2-weighted MRI confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
