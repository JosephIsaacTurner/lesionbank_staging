33647851,Auditory agnosia with anosognosia.,"Klarendić, Maja; Gorišek, Veronika R; Granda, Gal; Avsenik, Jernej; Zgonc, Vid; Kojović, Maja",Klarendić,"A 66-year-old right-handed female medical doctor suffered two consecutive cardioembolic strokes, initially affecting the right frontal lobe and the right insula, followed by a lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient presented with distinctive phenomenology of general auditory agnosia with anosognosia for the deficit. She did not understand verbal requests and her answers to oral questions were fluent but unrelated to the topic. However, she was able to correctly answer written questions, name objects, and fluently describe their purpose, which is characteristic for verbal auditory agnosia. She was also unable to recognise environmental sounds or to recognise and repeat any melody. These inabilities represent environmental sound agnosia and amusia, respectively. Surprisingly, she was not aware of the problem, not asking any questions regarding her symptoms, and avoiding discussing her inability to understand spoken language, which is indicative of anosognosia. The deficits in our patient followed a distinct pattern of recovery. The verbal auditory agnosia was the first to resolve, followed by environmental sound agnosia. Amusia persisted the longest. The patient was clinically assessed from the first day of symptom onset and the evolution of symptoms was video documented. We give a detailed account of the patient's behaviour and provide results of audiological and neuropsychological evaluations. We discuss the anatomy of auditory agnosia and anosognosia relevant to the case. This case study may serve to better understand auditory agnosia in clinical settings. It is important to distinguish auditory agnosia from Wernicke's aphasia, because use of written language may enable normal communication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.12.025,,Amusia; Anosognosia; Auditory agnosia; Environmental sound agnosia; Verbal auditory agnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

He underwent fibrinolytic treatment. During the following days he progressively recovered and was discharged without neurological focal sign. Patent foramen ovale was found. When he got back to his house he noticed that he was unable to recognize the voice of his favoured singers and needed to ask who was the singer to his relatives. Neuropsychological examination revealed a selective impairment in famous voice recognition in the absence of alteration of voice perception, face perception and famous face recognition. All other neuropsychological domains were spared. In particular language, memory and executive functions were intact. Neuroimaging carried out by means of PET and MRI revealed two small ischemic lesions in the right subcortical region, involving lenticular and caudate nuclei and in the right temporal pole. To our knowledge, this is the first case described in literature of a patient showing a selective associative phonagnosia after right anterior temporal stroke. The present case helps to clarify the brain circuits underlying famous voice recognition and adds evidence in favour of a right hemisphere involvement in processing knowledge of familiar voices. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of brain organization of person-specific and general semantic knowledge.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.05.016,,Associative phonagnosia; Famous voice recognition; Right temporal pole,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
32386850,Cortical deafness of following bilateral temporal lobe stroke.,"Silva, Júlia; Sousa, Marisa; Mestre, Susana; Nzwalo, Isa; Nzwalo, Hipólito",Silva,"Cortical deafness is an extremely rare clinical manifestation that originates mainly from bilateral cortical lesions in the primary auditory cortex. Its main clinical manifestation is the bilateral sudden loss of hearing. Diagnosis is difficulty due to its rarity and similarity with other language and communication disorders, such as Wernicke's aphasia, auditory agnosia or verbal deafness. Herein, we present a case report of a young woman with a sudden bilateral loss of auditory comprehension. Initially, a psychiatric nature of the disorder was considered, but the persistence of the symptoms, lead to the diagnosis of cortical deafness secondary to bilateral ischemic lesions in both temporal lobes. Progressive improvement occurred and three months after the initial manifestations she manifested pure verbal deafness. Cortical deafness usually has a poor functional prognosis, with limited therapeutic options. Rehabilitation and speech therapy is recommended to improve the chance of patients achieving communication skills.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104827,,Auditory agnosia; Auditory cortex; Cortical deafness; Stroke; Verbal deafness,Case Reports,United States,eng

Here we describe the case of KH, a 60-year-old active professional woman who reports that she has always experienced severe voice recognition difficulties. Her hearing abilities are normal, and an MRI scan showed no evidence of brain damage in regions associated with voice or auditory perception. To better understand her condition and to assess models of voice and high-level auditory processing, we tested KH on behavioural tasks measuring voice recognition, recognition of vocal emotions, face recognition, speech perception, and processing of environmental sounds and music. KH was impaired on tasks requiring the recognition of famous voices and the learning and recognition of new voices. In contrast, she performed well on nearly all other tasks. Her case is the first report of developmental phonagnosia, and the results suggest that the recognition of a speaker's vocal identity depends on separable mechanisms from those used to recognize other information from the voice or non-vocal auditory stimuli.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.08.003,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

He had good visual and hearing acuity, no hemianopsia, unilateral spatial neglect and visual object agnosia. However, he was unable to remember faces of his rehabilitation therapists, and repeatedly misidentified other patients' visitors and therapists as his family members and friends, without recognizing his mistakes. General cognitive function was preserved with Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) 25/30 (cut-off score 20). In terms of recognition of faces, tasks not requiring recognition of facial identity, such as interpreting facial emotions, and gender and age assessment, were relatively preserved, but recognition of family members and celebrities was severely impaired, and matching unfamiliar faces was slightly impaired. Semantic information of family and friends was retained. Although his symptoms resembled associative prosopagnosia, they differed from general associative prosopagnosia in having phonagnosia. MRI lesions were localized in the frontal and temporal lobes including the right anterior temporal lobe, and not in the right occipital and temporal lobes considered to the lesion site of multimodal people recognition disorders manifesting inability of utilization of visual (face) and auditory (voice) cues for person identification. In addition to the facial cognitive impairment, impaired exploratory (monitoring) function of the frontal lobe on the temporal lobe may also contribute to the false recognition/misidentification of this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.12.005,,Associative prosopagnosia; Cerebral infarction; False recognition/misidentification; Frégoli syndrome; Multimodal people recognition disorders; Right fronto-temporal lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Research on the auditory function and speech sounds in PPA, including temporal, phonemic, and prosodic processing, revealed impairment in some of these auditory processes. Many patients with PPA who present with impaired word recognition subsequently developed non-fluent variant PPA. Herein, we present a patient with semantic variant PPA (svPPA) who demonstrated impaired verbal word discrimination. Audiological examinations revealed normal auditory brainstem responses and slightly impaired pure-tone perception. By contrast, verbal word discrimination and monosyllable identification were impaired, and temporal auditory acuity deteriorated. Analyses of brain magnetic resonance images revealed a significant decrease in the gray matter volume in bilateral superior temporal areas, predominantly on the left, compared with those of patients with typical svPPA, which appeared to be associated with impaired word recognition in our patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2022.873735,PMC9243420,auditory agnosia; nonverbal sound discrimination; primary progressive aphasia; semantic variant; verbal word discrimination; verbal word recognition; word discrimination,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia is the disproportionate difficulty comprehending spoken compared to written language, also typically greater than difficulties with spoken and written language expression, in the absence of a primary sensory deficit. The terms pure word deafness and auditory verbal agnosia are often used synonymously. However, the broader term of auditory agnosia more accurately reflects difficulty processing both speech and non-speech sounds whereas individuals with auditory verbal agnosia (pure word deafness) have preserved processing of environmental sounds. Auditory agnosia is reported in the stroke literature, but rarely reported in progressive neurologic disorders. Here, we report a case of a woman who presented with what is best described as a prominent auditory deficit in the context of an initially unclassifiable, or mixed, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with accompanying apraxia of speech. Her clinical presentation shared features with auditory agnosia, although sensory functioning was not formally assessed. We report clinical and neuroimaging data spanning 6 years and subsequent autopsy results. She presented at 65 years of age, 5 years post onset of symptoms that included insidious and progressive difficulties thinking of words, constructing sentences, pronouncing words, and understanding instructions. She had disproportionate difficulty with comprehension of spoken compared to written language. She eventually developed features of the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA, as well as an apraxia of speech. Imaging with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed progression of bilateral (left greater than right) hypometabolism involving the frontal, temporal (predominantly the lateral superior gyrus), and parietal lobes, that eventually included the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and caudate.

The experimental study consisted of administering standard tests of music and environmental sound recognition to 40 unselected patients with unilateral stroke. Among case reports, music was selectively impaired more frequently than environmental sounds, whereas the reverse occurred in the experimental study. In this, right hemisphere lesions tended either to disrupt the apperception of environmental sounds, sparing music entirely, or to disrupt both environmental sounds and melody, sparing rhythm, whereas left hemisphere lesions tended to spare melody and to disrupt rhythm, either selectively or in association with the semantic identification of environmental sounds.",{},,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,10.1196/annals.1284.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

We verified that the patient exhibited persistent and severe auditory agnosia for nonverbal sounds in the absence of verbal comprehension deficits or peripheral hearing problems. Acoustical analyses suggested that his residual processing of a minority of environmental sounds might rely on his speech processing abilities. In the patient's brain, contralateral (right) temporal cortex as well as perilesional (left) anterior temporal cortex were strongly responsive to verbal, but not to nonverbal sounds, a pattern that stands in marked contrast to the controls' data.

Careful neurological reassessment and a cranial MRI yielded a diagnosis of cortical deafness with auditory agnosia secondary to bilateral temporal infarcts.

This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task-a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation-demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.10.023,PMC7856551,Audition; Misophonia; Music; Segregation; Speech perception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

A CT scan revealed bilateral, temporal lobe lesions from two ischaemic accidents that had occurred 9 months apart. The search for subtle deficits in the patient showed normal sensitivity to changes in the intensity and frequency of simple sounds; in contrast, his ability to discriminate sound duration and musical note sequences was severely impaired. The simultaneous recording of the whole auditory-evoked response pattern revealed no abnormality in the early components, which reflect the activation of the auditory nuclei and pathways of the brain stem. However, the middle and late components were delayed and slowed. These results and others in the literature suggest that the neocortex in man, as in other mammals, plays an essential role in the temporal aspects of hearing. Also, the two main ingredients commonly recognized in auditory agnosia, i.e. word deafness and the inability to interpret non-verbal sounds, are caused by the disruption of elementary, bilaterally represented cortical functions which start the processing of every kind of auditory information.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00313543,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The main component of middle latency auditory evoked potentials, which is evoked over both hemispheres by monaural stimulation to either side in normal subjects, was elicited only over the hemisphere contralateral to the ear receiving stimulation. Our patient's auditory findings were similar to those usually found in generalized auditory agnosia. Auditory agnosia is usually considered as a sign of a bitemporal cortical or subcortical disorder, but, in our patient, a brainstem disorder caused a disturbance of auditory recognition similar to auditory agnosia due to a bitemporal lesion. Our patient's auditory findings may belong to the category of a brainstem auditory-processing disorder brought on by a small hemorrhage in the inferior colliculi. In addition, the impairment in our patient implies that, in the neural processing of musical parameters, the decoding of intensity, tone and rhythm is accomplished at the level of inferior colliculus, whereas further cortical processing is necessary for the appropriate recognition of melody.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00261-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

This unilateral auditory agnosia was first associated with a right motor underutilization and right motor, sensitive, visual and auditive extinctions. Speech discrimination scores were 100% with the left ear and 15% with the right ear, even less in dichotic conditions.

There was severe hypoactivation of the left hemisphere with right monaural verbal stimulations. Rehabilitation consisting of non-specific attention tasks and repetitions of words reaching only the right ear was undertaken 15 months after the stroke. The oral language comprehension improved, as did the left hemisphere activation, and the extinction phenomena disappeared, except for the auditory one. The unilaterality of the auditory agnosia could be due, in part, to a peculiar physiological processing in this patient, such as poor performance of his right ipsilateral auditory pathway which could be improved with practice. A striatal lesion could induce a spatial hemi-inattention as reflected by the multimodal extinction in this case.

The patient complained of lack of musical appreciation and a battery of tests confirmed a dissociated receptive musical deficit in the presence of normal appreciation of environmental sounds and speech. The ability to detect continuous changes in sound frequency in the form of sinusoidal frequency modulation was preserved. There was, however, a deficit in the analysis of rapid temporal sequences of notes which could underlie his musical deficit. This case provides further evidence for the existence of amusia as a distinct form of auditory agnosia, but does not support the hypothesis that bilateral lesions are required to produce such a deficit. Unexpectedly, the patient was also found to have a deficit in the perception of apparent sound-source movement. We suggest that this deficit is analogous to the visual phenomenon of akinetopsia, and is in accord with PET work suggesting involvement of areas outside primary auditory cortex in sound movement perception. A possible common deficit in auditory temporal and spatial 'scene analysis' is discussed.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/120.5.785,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Voice recognition has been shown to evoke a distributed network of brain regions that includes, in addition to the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the anterior temporal pole, fusiform face area (FFA), and posterior cingulate gyrus (pCG). Here we report an individual (MS) with acquired prosopagnosia who, despite bilateral damage to much of this network, demonstrates the ability to distinguish voices of several well-known acquaintances from voices of people that he has never heard before. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed that, relative to speech-modulated noise, voices rated as familiar and unfamiliar by MS elicited enhanced haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus, left posterior STS, and posterior midline brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal pCG. More interestingly, relative to noise and unfamiliar voices, the familiar voices elicited greater haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus and medial parietal regions including the dorsal pCG and precuneus. The findings are consistent with theories implicating the pCG in recognizing people who are personally familiar, and furthermore suggest that the pCG region of the voice identification network is able to make functional contributions to voice recognition even though other areas of the network, namely the anterior temporal poles, FFA, and the right parietal lobe, may be compromised.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x246131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In view of recent promising results in the area of neurorehabilitation of language disorders after stroke, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a young woman with general auditory agnosia caused by traumatic injury to the left inferior colliculus. Specifically, we studied activations to sound embedded in a block design using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after application of anodal tDCS to the right auditory cortex. Before tDCS, auditory discrimination deficits were associated with abnormally reduced activations of the auditory cortex and bilateral unresponsiveness of the anterior superior temporal sulci and gyri. This session replicated a previous functional scan with the same paradigm a year before the current experiment. We then applied anodal tDCS over right auditory cortex for 20 min-utes and immediately re-scanned the patient. We found increased activation of bilateral auditory cortices and, for speech sounds, selectively increased activation in Broca's and Wernicke's areas.

The aims of our research are to elucidate lesion sites associated with cortical deafness and to clarify why patients with cerebral lesions are not aware of any sound at all. Three patients diagnosed as having total loss of hearing participated in this study. We conducted pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose cortical deafness with aphasia tests of these patients. Our studies showed that waves VI and VII as well as waves I to V have normal peak latencies in ABRs in all three patients.

Comprehensive follow-up examinations of auditory function were periodically conducted until his sudden death 15 years later. His brain was studied postmortem for neuropathology. Initial pure-tone audiometry revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. However, repeated pure-tone audiometry revealed that thresholds became progressively poorer over time, bilaterally. Speech audiometry of both ears consistently revealed that the patient was unable to discriminate any monosyllabic words (i.e. speech intelligibility scores were 0%, bilaterally). In general, speech and hearing tests demonstrated that he could not comprehend spoken words, but could comprehend written commands and gestures. Postmortem neuropathological study of the left hemisphere revealed total defect and neuronal loss of the superior temporal gyrus, including Heschl's gyrus, and total gliosis of the medial geniculate body. In the right hemisphere, examination revealed subcortical necrosis, gliosis in the centre of the superior temporal gyrus and partial gliosis of the medial geniculate body.

The results of audiological studies on temporal discrimination were similar to those described for bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The relationships between click intervals and the threshold to detect sound, and between numbers of clicks and the threshold, were also examined. We observed a tendency for the threshold to decline as the number of clicks was increased or the interval between two clicks was shortened.

For vowel classification, both superior temporal plane (STP) and STS areas have been suggested relevant. Lesion of bilateral STS may conversely be expected to cause pure word deafness and possibly also impaired vowel classification. Here we studied a patient with bilateral STS lesions caused by ischemic strokes and relatively intact medial STPs to characterize the behavioral consequences of STS loss. The patient showed severe deficits in auditory speech perception, whereas his speech production was fluent and communication by written speech was grossly intact. Auditory-evoked fields in the STP were within normal limits on both sides, suggesting that major parts of the auditory cortex were functionally intact. Further studies showed that the patient had normal hearing thresholds and only mild disability in tests for telencephalic hearing disorder. Prominent deficits were discovered in an auditory-object classification task, where the patient performed four standard deviations below the control group. In marked contrast, performance in a vowel-classification task was intact. Auditory evoked fields showed enhanced responses for vowels compared to matched non-vowels within normal limits. Our results are consistent with the notion that cortex along STS is important for auditory speech perception, although it does not appear to be entirely speech specific.

Using familiar and unfamiliar voices as stimuli, a marked difference between the ability to recognize familiar voice and the ability to discriminate between unfamiliar voices was identified in five patients, and a sixth showed a severe impairment in both tasks. Clinical and radiologic findings in these cases suggest that recognition of familiar voices is impaired by damage to inferior and lateral parietal regions of the right hemisphere, whereas impairment of voice discrimination abilities is associated with temporal lobe damage of either hemisphere.

He was diagnosed as having auditory agnosia caused by bilateral temporal lobe injury. We began to train him at once, individually and intensively. Adult patients with pure auditory agnosia followed by two episodes of temporal lobe infarction have impairment in central hearing but not inner language. Therefore, they can communicate by reading and writing. Moreover, impairment in hearing is not always severe and is often transient.

Her errors in a test of sound recognition were discriminative rather than associative in nature. Neuro-radiological examinations revealed bilateral subcortical lesions involving the fibers from the medial geniculate body to the temporal lobes after bilateral putaminal hemorrhage.

17565219,A case of auditory agnosia with impairment of perception and expression of music: cognitive processing of tonality.,"Satoh, Masayuki; Takeda, Katsuhiko; Kuzuhara, Shigeki",Satoh,"There is fairly general agreement that the melody and the rhythm are the independent components of the perception of music. In the theory of music, the melody and harmony determine to which tonality the music belongs. It remains an unsettled question whether the tonality is also an independent component of the perception of music, or a by-product of the melody and harmony. We describe a patient with auditory agnosia and expressive amusia that developed after a bilateral infarction of the temporal lobes. We carried out a detailed examination of musical ability in the patient and in control subjects. Comparing with a control population, we identified the following impairments in music perception: (a) discrimination of familiar melodies; (b) discrimination of unfamiliar phrases, and (c) discrimination of isolated chords. His performance in pitch discrimination and tonality were within normal limits. Although intrasubject statistical analysis revealed significant difference only between tonality task and unfamiliar phrase performance, comparison with control subjects suggested a dissociation between a preserved tonality analysis and impairment of perception of melody and chords. By comparing the results of our patient with those in the literature, we may say that there is a double dissociation between the tonality and the other components. Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose that tonality is an independent component of music perception. Based on our present and previous studies, we proposed the revised version of the cognitive model of musical processing in the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,European neurology,10.1159/000103640,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

The patient and a group of six normal volunteers were scanned in the following three conditions: (i) passive listening to environmental sounds; (ii) categorization of environmental sounds; (iii) at rest. In normal subjects, passive listening as compared with rest was associated with significant activations in the auditory cortices and posterior thalami, and in the inferior parietal lobe and anterior insula/frontal opercular region on the right. In J.B., activations were observed in the spared auditory cortex and inferior parietal lobe of the right hemisphere and in regions adjacent to the perisylvian lesion in the left hemisphere (anterior insula/frontal opercular region, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe). The recovered function, as measured by categorization of sounds compared with passive listening, in J.B. was associated with bilateral activation of a distributed network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices, as well as the right cerebellum and the right caudate nucleus. In addition, there was a left-sided activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus. In normal subjects, the same categorization task led to activation of a network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices in the left hemisphere only. These results suggest that bilateral activation (with recruitment of areas homologous to those known to be responsible for normal function), the engagement of peri-infarct regions, and the involvement of a more widespread neocortical network, are mechanisms of functional reorganization after injury that may enable recovery from, or compensation for, cognitive deficits.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/118.6.1395,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Confusion has arisen with regard to the usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term ""word deafness"" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions.

A male patient experienced mild left temporal hemiplegia because of right putaminal hemorrhage at the age of 43 years. Thereafter he recovered completely but hypertension persisted. When he was 53 years old, he suffered left putaminal hemorrhage and went into a coma. After recovering from the coma and right hemiplegia he could hear but could not discriminate speech sounds. Brain CT and MRI demonstrated small bilateral lesions confined to the auditory radiations. Magnetoencephalography demonstrated the disappearance of middle latency responses and auditory-evoked potential studies showed a very small Pa peak. In contrast, a positron emission tomography study demonstrated a marked increase in blood flow in the bilateral auditory cortex in response to both click and monosyllable stimuli. It is speculated that the auditory cortex receives functional projections from the cochlea via non-specific pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.",{},,Acta oto-laryngologica,10.1080/00016480510027501,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Clinically, it characterized by impairment of comprehension and repetition of speech but reading, writing, and spontaneous speech are preserved. So it is distinguished from generalized auditory agnosia by the preserved ability to recognize non verbal sounds. We present the clinical picture of a forty-years-old, right handed woman who developed verbal auditory agnosic after an bilateral temporal ischemic infarcts due to atrial fibrillation by dilated cardiomyopathie. Neurophysiological studies by pure tone threshold audiometry: brainstem auditory evoked potentials and cortical auditory evoked potentials showed sparing of peripheral hearing and intact auditory pathway in brainstem but impaired cortical responses. Cranial CT-SCAN revealed two large hypodenses area involving both cortico-subcortical temporal lobes.

In this case study, we administered a series of speech and nonspeech discrimination tests to an individual with unilateral VAA as a result of left-temporal-lobe damage. The results indicated that the subject's ability to perceive steady-state acoustic stimuli was relatively intact but his ability to perceive dynamic stimuli was drastically reduced. We conclude that this particular aspect of acoustic processing may be a major contributing factor that disables speech perception in subjects with unilateral VAA.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.2000.2319,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

She showed pure word deafness and auditory agnosia because of bilateral temporo-parietal lesions. The left lesion resulted from angiospasm of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm of the left carotid artery, and the right one resulted from subcortical hematoma after the V-P shunt operation. CT scan revealed the abnormal low density area on the bilateral temporo-parietal regions seven months after onset. Neurophychological findings were as follows: there were no aphasic symptoms such as paraphasia, word finding difficulties, or disturbances of spontaneous writing, reading and calculation. But her auditory comprehension was severely disturbed, and she could neither repeat words after the tester nor write from dictation. She also could not recognize meaningful sounds and music in spite of normal hearing sensitivity for pure tone, BSR and AER. We discussed the neuropsychological mechanisms of auditory recognition, and assumed that each hemisphere might process both verbal and non-verbal auditory stimuli in the secondary auditory area. The auditory input may be recognized at the left association area, the final level of this mechanism. Pure word deafness and auditory agnosia of this case might be caused by the disruption of the right secondary auditory area, the pathway between the left primary auditory area and the left secondary auditory area, and between the left and right secondary auditory areas.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Head CT scan showed a left middle cerebral artery infarct involving the posterior part of the temporal lobe. In September 1995, a second stroke occurred. Head CT scan revealed a recent right middle cerebral artery infarct within the posterior part of temporal cortex. Auditory agnosia was diagnosed.

Recognition of environmental sounds was extremely impaired when tested in a multiple choice sound-picture matching task, whereas auditory discrimination between sounds and picture identifications by written names was almost undisturbed. In a therapy experiment, we tried to enhance sound recognition via semantic categorization and association, imitation of sound and analysis of auditory features, respectively. The stimulation of conscious auditory analysis proved to be increasingly effective over a 4-week period of therapy. We were able to show that the patient's improvement was not only a simple effect of practicing, but it was stable and carried over to nontrained items.",{},,Folia phoniatrica,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Switzerland,ger

It has been shown that disordered temporal acuity leads to disturbed consonant perception in cases with pure word deafness. In contrast, there has been no clear explanation of how vowel perception is impaired. We examined a patient with auditory agnosia, who showed a differential ability to identify the five Japanese vowels after bilateral cerebral lesions. He correctly identified the vowel [a] in more than 70% of auditory presentations, whereas he identified [i] in only about 30% of presentations. The difference between the first and second formant frequencies ""F2-F1"" and an artificially defined value ""F1-(F2-F1)"" for each vowel correlated significantly with the percentage of correct identifications.

CT scan demonstrated bilateral temporal lobe lesions, predominantly on the left side where it extended into the adjacent parietal and frontal lobes. Audiometry suggested integrity of the internal ear and brain stem. Early auditory evoked potentials were present, while potentials of moderate latency and delayed potentials were abolished. Neuropsychological investigations demonstrated total absence of spoken language, contrasting with conservation of written language, though with agrammatism and an impossibility of identifying non-verbal noises, spoken language, and music. The patient could not identify rhythms, pitch, melodies or the different types of music. The musical quality of sound stimuli and musical pleasure were, however spared as shown by recognition of tape recorded sound stimuli with written denomination and designation of images in multiple choice tests. The relations between auditory agnosia, ""pure"" verbal deafness and cortical deafness are discussed. Reported cases are reviewed and an attempt is made to demonstrate the existence of several levels in the integration of musical stimuli, the most elementary of which could be the perception of the musical quality of sounds, as was the case in the present patient.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

The clinical picture following the acute phase of disease was dominated by severe fluent aphasia, prominent oral tendencies, visual agnosia, and a decrease in fear reactions. Most of these symptoms, with the obvious exception of aphasia, are similar to those observed by Kluver and Bucy in rhesus monkeys that underwent bitemporal lobectomy. These manifestations may be explained by the tendency of the herpes simplex virus to invade the temporal lobes. ""Agnosia"" in the auditory field and changes in vocal behavior were observed by H. Kluver and P. C. Bucy (1939, Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 42, 949-1000) in some of their bitemporal monkeys.

A case report and an attempt of neuropsychological qualification (author's transl)].,"Ulrich, G",Ulrich,"Proceeding from the neuropsychological examination of a patient with an exceptionally selective impairment of auditory gnosis of vascular origin, we make an attempt to analyze structurally the syndrome of auditory agnosia, a study of which has been neglected in comparison with analyses of visual agnosia. In our analysis we refer to 28 case reports, documented in the literature. Decisive syndromal points of view are: a) there is an absence of significant audiological deficiencies; b) errors of the acoustic-discriminative type prevail in auditory-visual matching tasks; c) the gnostic deficit is modality specific; d) the same items are variably reproduced on repeated presentation; e) there is marked fluctuation of performance; f) there is exceptional irreversibility of the impairment; g) amusia is a more or less obligatory accompanying phenomenon; h) in cases of vascular origin there is always a history of repeated temporal lobe damage, this damage being predominantly in the form of bilateral lesions. This analysis indicates a close structural analogy to the syndrome of perceptive visual agnosia. We place great importance in the relationship between approaches and models of cognitive psychology (Neisser, 1967) which we see as important for further theoretical development in neuropsychology.",{},,Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger

He could recognize Arabic music and instruments but not words of songs; a radio broadcast from the Koran, but not the individual words; a male as opposed to female voice; Arabic and non-Arabic languages; and whether sentences were questions, exclamations, or imperatives. He discerned whether the speaker was emotionally neutral, happy, angry or sad. Contextual cues and reducing the rate of speaking aided verbal comprehension. Pure tone threshhold audiometry revealed mild bilateral sensorineural loss up to 2000 Hz and a moderate high frequency loss. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were normal, cortical auditory evoked potentials abnormal.

Besides, she presented language disorders of aphasic type relating to a sensorial transcortical aphasia. The case meets the diagnostic criteria for crossed aphasia. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a right temporo-parietal infarct. There was no sensorial or peripheral auditive disorder and no auditory agnosia of non verbal modality. During the evolution, the aphasic symptoms diminished partially and the subjective auditory deficit of the left ear continued. The integrated auditory evaluation (neuroacoustic test, study of auditory gnosia, dichotic listening test, evoked cortical auditory potentials) allowed the evidence of the characteristic disturbances of a right hemianacousia: loss of left hear in dichotic audition, decrease of amplitude of evoked right cortical auditory potentials. In the light of theories concerning auditory integration, one can explain this evolution. The initial aphasic comprehension disturbance expresses the alteration of the linguistic treatment of auditory information of the dominant hemisphere, here the right hemisphere. Subsequently, the linguistic disturbance regresses largely, letting persist the change of general auditory treatment. The representation of this general auditory treatment is hemispheric bilateral, the only right hemispheric damage shall result in hemianacousia.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

The perfectly demarcated and unique lesion was located in the left posterior temporoparietal region. Language examinations in French and Italian demonstrated entirely comparable difficulties in both languages. The linguistic course was favorable after a period of auditory agnosia and global aphasia. Language became fluent again 3 months after the onset, with a marked vocabulary loss and phonemic paraphasias with attempts at self-correction. Repetition was altered markedly with a deficit in auditory comprehension but no remaining elements of auditory agnosia. Reading was possible, but with some difficulty and total agraphia and acalculia persisted. Musical ability was better conserved, particularly with respect to repetition and above all to writing, the sparing of the latter constituting a fairly uncommon dissociation in relation to agraphia.

7115592,[A case of hysterical deafness].,"Takamori, A; Kaga, K; Shindo, M; Nakagawa, K",Takamori,"A forty years old woman with hysterical deafness is reported. Chief complaints were bilateral hearing loss. Nothing particular was found in her past and family history. In 1977, on the 11th day of May, she was admitted to A city hospital because of headache and paresis of right limb. As angiography revealed an aneurysms of her anterior communicating artery, she was undertaken the surgery of clipping and coating of the aneurysms. Post-operatively, left hemiparalysis appeared and paresis of right limb developed because of spasm of right middle cerebral artery. On the 14th day of August, ventricular-peritoneal shunt's operation was performed. As soon as she recovered from postoperative coma, she complained of bilateral hearing loss. Because pure tone audiometry demonstrated complete loss of her hearing, she was referred to ENT department of Teikyo University Hospital. Findings were as follows: 1) She had a queer way of hearing because she could understand to hear limited persons' speech (her doctor and husband). 2) Pure tone audiometry showed complete loss of her hearing but the thresholds of auditory brain stem responses were 15 dB and those of slow vertex responses were 45 dB. These results suggested no lesion in cochlea and brain stem. 3) Rorschach test and sentence complete test were performed. The results of these tests suggested hysterical state or neurotic state. 4) Total intelligent quotients by WAIS were 69 which indicated borderline level. However, this value appeared to be incorrect because she was uncooperative. 5) CT scan revealed low density areas at right temporo-parietal lobes and left temporal lobe which were localized and small. Our findings suggested hysterical deafness but not auditory agnosia. During three years, she was referred to several hospitals for rehabilitation but didn't become well at all. On the third year of the onset, her husband became sick and admitted to her room of the same hospital. During that period, suddenly, she talked her hearing to improve and the pure tone audiometry demonstrated decrease in threshold.
