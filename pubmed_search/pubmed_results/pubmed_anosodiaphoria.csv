38214846,"Generalized anosognosia, anosodiaphoria, and visual hallucinations with bilateral enucleation after severe bifrontal brain injury: a case report describing similarities with and differences from Anton syndrome.","Rodríguez, Gabriel; Azariah, Abana; Ritter, Alexandra Meurgue; Esquenazi, Yoshua; Sherer, Mark; Boake, Corwin; Fernandez, Valentina Ladera; Garcia-Garcia, Ricardo",Rodríguez,"Visual anosognosia, associated with confabulations and cortical blindness in the context of occipital lobe injury, is known as Anton syndrome. Patients with this syndrome strongly deny their vision loss and confabulate to compensate for both visual loss and memory impairments. In this article, we present a case of a patient with some similarities to Anton syndrome, however, with several differences in clinical presentation. Bifrontal brain injury, bilateral enucleation, affective indifference (anosodiaphoria), generalized anosognosia, and the conviction that vision will resume mark clear clinical differences with Anton syndrome. Differentiating these findings from Anton syndrome will help occupational therapists, neuropsychologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, and physicians when assessing frontal lobe brain injury with total and partial visual loss. This case demonstrates that visual anosognosia and confabulations can occur without occipital lobe dysfunction or cortical blindness.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-024-07323-z,,Agnosia visual; Anosodiaphoria; Anosognosia; Anton syndrome; Enucleation,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
26287755,"Psychosis, psychedelic substance misuse and head injury: A case report and 23 year follow-up.","Sami, Musa; Piggott, Katie; Coysh, Claire; Fialho, Antonio",Sami,"This study describes the case of a 57 year old gentleman with a previous severe brain injury who developed a severe psychotic disorder 19 years after the injury. This appears to have been precipitated by heavy psychedelic substance use, including cannabis, salvia divinorum, ketamine, LSD, cocaine and DMT amongst others. The psychosis remained in the absence of drug intoxication and was associated with prominent apathy, lack of concern and abulia. This study discusses the heavy psychedelic substance misuse possibly potentiating a transition to psychosis in this individual. Little work has been undertaken in this area as substance misuse has traditionally been an exclusion criteria for investigating psychosis in this patient group. It is suggested that psychedelic substance misuse should be investigated as a risk factor for psychotic illness in patients with brain injury, as this case clearly suggests.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1046491,,Drug-use; neuropsychiatry; psychosis; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35437292,[Case Report: Broca's Aphasia in a Left-Handed Patient with a Right Brain Infarction and Early Stage Aphonia].,"Ochiai, Yukiko; Bandoh, Mitsuaki; Sunami, Yoko; Miyakoshi, Natsuki; Kiyokawa, Yukari; Isozaki, Eiji",Ochiai,"We report a case of Broca's aphasia in a left-handed patient with a right brain infarction. The patient's speech is consistent with a particular type of aphemia, that is, without vocalization except for a few phonemes or words. The patient presented with aphonia in an early stage. The lack of speech could be due to the impairment of the phonological-speech process or speech initialization. This type of aphemia has been reported to involve the right inferior precentral gyrus or right middle and inferior frontal gyri. Our patient had both lesions. The symptom and the lesion of this type of aphemia could differ from those of another type of aphemia corresponding to apraxia of speech, and the speech of Broca's aphasia could have multiple mechanisms. Our case shows Alexander's anomalous type with atypical lateralization and distribution of the lesion. Verbal intrahemispheric dissociation apraxia was suspected in our patient. The coexistence of aphasia, anosodiaphoria of hemiplegia is a dual symptom in which bilateral hemispheric functions exist in a unilateral hemisphere.

18444719,Emotional and motivational changes after bilateral lesions of the globus pallidus.,"Vijayaraghavan, Lavanya; Vaidya, Jatin G; Humphreys, Clare T; Beglinger, Leigh J; Paradiso, Sergio",Vijayaraghavan,"This study investigated motivational changes in a 44 year-old man (PJ) who developed considerable reduction in spontaneous activity and speech, flat affect, social withdrawal, loss of interest, inability to ""feel,"" and lack of concern regarding his medical condition after bilateral, focal, anoxic lesions of the globus pallidus. PJ and 30 male controls performed a task designed to parse hedonic evaluation, or liking, from incentive motivation, or wanting. Affective stimuli were presented on a computer screen and subjects controlled viewing time by pressing keys. PJ's liking and wanting of unpleasant stimuli was similar to that of controls. In response to pleasant stimuli, PJ showed normal ratings of wanting and hedonic appreciation, but significantly reduced viewing time or made no responses. Active withdrawal from liked stimuli could constitute the basic mechanism underlying poor motivation and social withdrawal associated with globus pallidus damage.",{},,Neuropsychology,10.1037/0894-4105.22.3.412,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Besides a mild left hemiparesis the clinical symptomatology included a pronounced hemi-neglect syndrome in the form of unilateral limb akinesia, a failure to respond to stimuli presented to the left of the midline as well as anosognosia and anosodiaphoria. Despite the 6-week rehabilitation training, the neglect syndrome was rather stabilized with only a slight tendency for improvement.",{},,Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Poland,pol
20472278,Persistent left unilateral mirror writing: A neuropsychological case study.,"Angelillo, Valentina G; De Lucia, Natascia; Trojano, Luigi; Grossi, Dario",Angelillo,"Mirror writing (MW) is a rare disorder in which a script runs in direction opposite to normal and individual letters are reversed. The disorder generally occurs after left-hemisphere lesions, is transient and is observed on the left hand, whereas usually motor impairments prevent assessment of direction of right handwriting. We describe a left-handed patient with complete left hand mirror writing, still evident 2 years after a hemorrhagic stroke in left nucleo-capsular region. Since the patient could write with his right hand he underwent several writing tasks with either hand, and a thorough assessment to clarify the nature of MW. MW was evident in writing to dictation with left hand only, both in right and left hemispace, but the patient could modify his behavior when a verbal instruction was provided. No mirror errors were found in reading words, in copying geometric figures and in spatial orientation tasks. MW in our patient could be accounted for by a failure in automatic transformation of grapho-motor programs to write with the left hand. A lack of concern (a sort of anosodiaphoria) and a poor cognitive flexibility could contribute to long-term persistence of MW.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Brain and language,10.1016/j.bandl.2010.04.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
