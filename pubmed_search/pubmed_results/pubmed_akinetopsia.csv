31036340,Akinetopsia on Driving.,"Maeda, Kengo",Maeda,"Akinetopsia is a quite rare symptom. Two types of akinetopsia have been reported: one is cinematographic vision, and the other is invisibility of moving objects. These symptoms are thought to occur due to dysfunction of the MT/V5 area at the occipitoparietal region. I herein describe a 54-year-old man who collided with a car parked on the left side of the road while driving. He complained that the parked car looked to be moving forwards and he could not stop his car when he noticed that it was parked. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed the fresh infarction on the right temporoparietal region involving the MT/V5 area. His symptom during driving was considered cinematographic vision and it was the cause of the traffic accident. Akinetopsia resulted in illusory kinetopsia on driving and the traffic accident.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2019.02.036,,Akinetopsia; Infarction; Kinetopsia; MT/V5 area; Optic flow,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
38691276,Akinetopsia (visual motion blindness) associated with brain metastases: a case report.,"Viscardi, Lucas Henriques; Kleber, Fabricio Diniz; Custódio, Henrique; Costa, Angelo Brandelli; Brollo, Janaína",Viscardi,"Akinetopsia is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by an impaired perception of movement, often resulting from brain damage due to ischemia, epilepsy, or medication. It is also known as visual motion blindness, and patients with this condition are unable to perceive motion normally even with perfect visual acuity. This report aims to present a case of a patient in their late 40 s who developed akinetopsia and also an impairment in movement perception of objects without emitting sounds, after experiencing a late relapse of breast cancer with the occurrence of multiple brain metastases. The patient also experienced visual hallucinations, night terrors, and difficulty forming anterograde memory. Neuroimaging with MRI revealed severe brain damage, especially in the middle temporal area of the visual cortex. Akinetopsia is a rare phenomenon, and this is the first known case of its association with brain metastases.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-024-07565-x,,Akinetopsia; Brain Metastases; Breast Cancer; Visual Cortex,Case Reports; Journal Article; Letter,Italy,eng
30661737,The effect of target speed on perception of visual motion direction in a patient with akinetopsia.,"Heutink, Joost; de Haan, Gera; Marsman, Jan-Bernard; van Dijk, Mart; Cordes, Christina",Heutink,"Although much research has been devoted to the neural correlates of motion perception, the processing of speed of motion is still a topic of discussion. Apart from patient LM, no in-depth clinical research has been done in the past 20 years on this topic. In the present study, we investigated patient TD, who suffered from the rare disorder akinetopsia due to bilateral lesions of V5 after stroke. By means of a Random-Dot-Kinematogram (RDK) in which speed was varied systematically, it was found that TD was impaired in perceiving the direction of movement at speeds exceeding 9 deg/s. Our study suggests that V5 plays an important role in processing high-speed visual motion and further implies that V5 does not play a crucial role in processing low-speed visual motion. A remarkable finding, which has not been shown before, was that TD always reported the opposite direction of the actual movement at a speed of 24 deg/s. This suggests a form of the continuous wagon wheel illusion, which might have been caused by intact brain areas operating at different sampling rates than area V5.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2018.12.002,,Akinetopsia; Dynamic parallelism; Motion blindness; V5; Visual motion processing,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
7496774,Motion and shape perception in cerebral akinetopsia.,"Rizzo, M; Nawrot, M; Zihl, J",Rizzo,"Motion cues serve many purposes in primate vision. Consequently, akinetopsia, a defect of movement perception due to cerebral lesions, would be expected to comprise a range of motion-related defects. To address this issue we explored further the perceptual profiles in akinetopsic subject L.M. who has motion perception deficits due to extensive bilateral lesions of the dorsolateral visual association cortex that spare primary visual cortex, area V1. We used several different experimental procedures. Using random-dot motion stimuli, we showed that L.M. can still perceive global coherent motion and discriminate motion direction, yet these abilities fail even at moderate levels of background noise. L.M. also viewed a two-frame apparent (phi) motion stimulus known as a Ternus display. Her performance on this test suggests defective 'long-range' apparent motion mechanisms. These results are clearly in agreement with previous reports. Additional experiments showed that L.M. can still perceive 2-D shape and 3-D structure-from-motion (SFM). However, like motion direction discrimination, these abilities broke down at moderate levels of moving and stationary noise. Surprisingly, L.M. also had trouble perceiving 2-D shapes defined by non-motion signals including 'on' and 'off' transients, dynamic and static binocular disparity, and static texture cues. Our findings highlight the role of the visual association cortex in extracting salient information from noise.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/118.5.1105,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng
23557277,"The Zeitraffer phenomenon, akinetopsia, and the visual perception of speed of motion: a case report.","Ovsiew, Fred",Ovsiew,"The Zeitraffer phenomenon is the altered perception of the speed of moving objects. A single case is reported using the subject's own description of a transient alteration of the visual perception of motion. The literature on the subject is reviewed. The Zeitraffer phenomenon probably arises from dysfunction of brain networks subserving visual perception of speed. It shares characteristics with akinetopsia, the loss of visual ability to perceive motion.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770877,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
9183249,Spatial and temporal auditory processing deficits following right hemisphere infarction. A psychophysical study.,"Griffiths, T D; Rees, A; Witton, C; Cross, P M; Shakir, R A; Green, G G",Griffiths,"Higher auditory function in a patient was investigated following a right hemisphere infarction between the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories involving the insula. The patient complained of lack of musical appreciation and a battery of tests confirmed a dissociated receptive musical deficit in the presence of normal appreciation of environmental sounds and speech. The ability to detect continuous changes in sound frequency in the form of sinusoidal frequency modulation was preserved. There was, however, a deficit in the analysis of rapid temporal sequences of notes which could underlie his musical deficit. This case provides further evidence for the existence of amusia as a distinct form of auditory agnosia, but does not support the hypothesis that bilateral lesions are required to produce such a deficit. Unexpectedly, the patient was also found to have a deficit in the perception of apparent sound-source movement. We suggest that this deficit is analogous to the visual phenomenon of akinetopsia, and is in accord with PET work suggesting involvement of areas outside primary auditory cortex in sound movement perception. A possible common deficit in auditory temporal and spatial 'scene analysis' is discussed.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/120.5.785,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

26121499,A deficit perceiving slow motion after brain damage and a parallel deficit induced by crowding.,"Ma, Zheng; McCloskey, Michael; Flombaum, Jonathan I",Ma,"Motion perception is known to involve at least 2 kinds of mechanisms-lower level signal detectors and higher level algorithms for comparing object positions over time. When stimulus motion is modal (continuously visible), it is generally assumed that processing via lower level mechanisms is sufficient to make accurate motion judgments. We investigated the possibility that higher level mechanisms may also be involved in the processing of slow motion, even when it is smooth and continuous. This possibility was suggested by results from a brain-damaged patient, JKI, who showed left visual field deficits in both the explicit representation of object position and judgments concerning the direction of slow, but not fast, smooth motion. We investigated the possibility further by using crowding to induce a behaviorally similar motion-perception deficit in healthy observers. Crowding, which is known to impair object-position representation, impaired direction judgments for slow, but not for faster, smooth motion. The results suggest an everyday role for higher level mechanisms in the perception of slow motion, and they reinforce the taxonomy of motion perception in terms of underlying processing mechanisms as opposed to stimulus properties.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of experimental psychology.
