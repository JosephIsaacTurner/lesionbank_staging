23385699,Sleep and comorbid neurologic disorders.,"Watson, Nathaniel F; Viola-Saltzman, Mari",Watson,"An understanding of the impact of sleep on neurologic disorders, and the impact of neurologic disorders on sleep, provides fresh opportunities for neurologists to improve the quality of life and functioning of their patients. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and should be considered in all TIA and stroke patients. Sleep disorders can amplify nociception and worsen headache disorders; and some headaches, including those related to SDB and hypnic headache, are sleep specific. REM sleep behavior disorder may be an early sign of neurodegenerative disease. Focal lesions of almost any etiology (eg, multiple sclerosis and CNS malignancies) in the hypothalamus, basal forebrain, or brainstem may result in sleep disturbance, sleepiness, and insomnia. Sleep-related hypoventilation and fatigue are common in neuromuscular disease. SDB and epilepsy are mutually facilitatory, and poor sleep can exacerbate epilepsy. Continued surveillance for sleep disorders by neurologists is rewarded by new treatment avenues in their patients with the possibility of improved clinical outcomes.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/01.CON.0000427208.13553.8c,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

In the elderly, anti-LGI1 and contactin associated protein like 2 (CASPR2) antibody-associated diseases compose a relevant fraction of autoimmune encephalitis. Patients with LGI1 autoantibodies are known to present with limbic encephalitis and additionally faciobrachial dystonic seizures may occur. However, the clinical spectrum of CASPR2 autoantibody-associated disorders is more diverse including limbic encephalitis, Morvan's syndrome, peripheral nerve hyperexcitability syndrome, ataxia, pain and sleep disorders. Reports on unusual, sometimes isolated and immunotherapy-responsive movement disorders in CASPR2 autoantibody-associated syndromes have caused substantial concern regarding necessity of autoantibody testing in patients with movement disorders. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess their prevalence and manifestation in patients with CASPR2 autoimmunity. This international, retrospective cohort study included patients with CASPR2 autoimmunity from participating expert centres in Europe. Patients with ataxia and/or movement disorders were analysed in detail using questionnaires and video recordings. We recruited a comparator group with anti-LGI1 encephalitis from the GENERATE network. Characteristics were compared according to serostatus. We identified 164 patients with CASPR2 autoantibodies. Of these, 149 (90.8%) had only CASPR2 and 15 (9.1%) both CASPR2 and LGI1 autoantibodies. Compared to 105 patients with LGI1 encephalitis, patients with CASPR2 autoantibodies more often had movement disorders and/or ataxia (35.6 versus 3.8%; P < 0.001). This was evident in all subgroups: ataxia 22.6 versus 0.0%, myoclonus 14.6 versus 0.0%, tremor 11.0 versus 1.9%, or combinations thereof 9.8 versus 0.0% (all P < 0.001). The small group of patients double-positive for LGI1/CASPR2 autoantibodies (15/164) significantly more frequently had myoclonus, tremor, 'mixed movement disorders', Morvan's syndrome and underlying tumours. We observed distinct movement disorders in CASPR2 autoimmunity (14.6%): episodic ataxia (6.7%), paroxysmal orthostatic segmental myoclonus of the legs (3.7%) and continuous segmental spinal myoclonus (4.3%). These occurred together with further associated symptoms or signs suggestive of CASPR2 autoimmunity. However, 2/164 patients (1.2%) had isolated segmental spinal myoclonus. Movement disorders and ataxia are highly prevalent in CASPR2 autoimmunity. Paroxysmal orthostatic segmental myoclonus of the legs is a novel albeit rare manifestation. Further distinct movement disorders include isolated and combined segmental spinal myoclonus and autoimmune episodic ataxia.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awac276,,CASPR2; autoimmune encephalitis; movement disorders; myoclonus; neuronal autoantibodies,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
37060179,Anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 encephalitis: Five case reports and literature review.,"Chen, Sixian; Ren, Haitao; Lin, Fuhong; Fan, Siyuan; Cao, Yuze; Zhao, Weili; Guan, Hongzhi; , ",Chen,"To describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) encephalitis. We reviewed the clinical data of five patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis, and performed a literature review. The five cases included a 52-year-old man who developed a biphasic course of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis after herpes simplex encephalitis, a 22-year-old woman who showed bilateral basal ganglia lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a 36-year-old man with mixed aphasia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a 51-year-old man presented with personality changes, hallucinations, delusions, sleeping disorders and a 58-year-old man with short-term memory deficits and absence seizures.. There are 16 reported cases of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis worldwide. Of all 21 patients, with a median onset age of 35 years old, the main neurological symptoms were cognitive impairment (85.7%, 18/21), psychiatric or behavior problems (76.2%, 16/21), seizures (57.1%, 12/21), sleeping disorders (52.4%, 11/21), different degrees of decreased consciousness (42.9%, 9/21), and movement disorders (23.8%, 5/21). Brain MRI was normal in 11 of 21 patients. Lesions of the limbic lobes were presented in 5 patients, while involvement of other extralimbic regions was also reported. Seven of 21 (33.3%) cases were combined with tumors. Elevated white blood cell counts or specific oligoclonal IgG bands in the cerebrospinal fluid were found in 18 of 21 patients, with marked improvements observed after immunotherapy. Patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis typically present with diffuse, rather than purely limbic, encephalitis. Anti-mGluR5 encephalitis can be triggered by herpes simplex encephalitis. The risk of a combined tumor may be reduced in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.3003,PMC10175974,autoimmune encephalitis; herpes simplex virus; metabotropic glutamate receptor 5,"Review; Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Moreover, anti-IgLON5 disease can present with symptoms characteristic of multiple system atrophy (MSA), such as cerebellar ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. However, the clinical features of anti-IgLON5 disease resembling MSA have not been well established. We enrolled 35 patients with suspected MSA for whom anti-IgLON5 antibody tests were requested. We evaluated immunoglobulin G (IgG) against IgLON5 using cell-based assays. We also summarized the clinical characteristics of patients who were positive for anti-IgLON5 antibodies. We identified serum and cerebrospinal fluid anti-IgLON5 antibodies in three patients. These patients had many clinical features characteristic of MSA, including parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, severe orthostatic hypotension, acute respiratory failure, sleep parasomnia, vocal cord paralysis, and pyramidal tract signs. Clinical features atypical for MSA were myorhythmia, horizontal eye movement restriction, fasciculations, and painful muscle cramps. Anti-IgLON5 disease may be an important differential diagnosis of MSA. A comprehensive physical examination, including assessments of eye movement, lower motor neuron signs, and atypical involuntary movements, is important to avoid misdiagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2024.106992,,Anti-IgLON5 disease; Multiple system atrophy; Orthostatic hypotension; Vocal cord paralysis,Journal Article; Case Reports,England,eng

26038584,Brain injury and deprivation of liberty on neurosciences wards: 'a gilded cage is still a cage'.,"Ashby, Gillian Alice; Griffin, Colette; Agrawal, Niruj",Ashby,"In March 2014, a UK Supreme Court case, known as Cheshire West, reached a judgement that greatly expanded the group of people in England and Wales who could be considered deprived of their liberty when under the care of the state. This now includes anyone meeting what is known as the 'acid test': whether the person is under 'continuous supervision and control' and 'not free to leave'. The case concerned three people with learning disability, living in community residential placements; all were judged to have been deprived of their liberty, despite being apparently content, and having 'relative normality' for people in their situation. Many people consider the case to apply to hospital settings. Clearly, many neurosciences inpatients are under 'continuous supervision and control'. This might include being told when to eat or sleep, what medication to take or being under close nursing observation. Many also are not free to leave because of safety concerns. Inpatients may also be eligible for detention under Mental Health Act--if they have a mental disorder sufficient to warrant this--such as a risk to that person's health or safety, or the safety of others. Thus, we have a confusing combination of two laws that might apply. This article aims to demystify the legal background and apply it to clinical practice in England and Wales and elsewhere.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Practical neurology,10.1136/practneurol-2014-000957,,CLINICAL NEUROLOGY; NEUROPSYCHIATRY,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng
36446232,Myoclonus status revealing COVID 19 infection.,"Ben Mohamed, Dina; Zouari, Rania; Ketata, Jihen; Nabli, Fatma; Blel, Samir; Ben Sassi, Samia",Ben Mohamed,"At the beginning of the coronavirus virus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was thought to cause mainly respiratory symptoms, largely sparing the brain and the rest of the nervous system. However, as the knowledge about COVID-19 infection progresses and the number of COVID19-related neurological manifestations reports increases, neurotropism and neuroinvasion were finally recognized as major features of the SARS-CoV-2. Neurological manifestations involving the central nervous system are sparse, ranging from headaches, drowsiness, and neurovascular attacks to seizures and encephalitis [1]. Thus far, several cases of non-epileptic myoclonus were reported in critical patients [2,3]. Here, we report the first case of myoclonus status as the inaugural and sole symptom of COVID-19 in a conscious patient. A 60-year-old man with unknown family history and no medical issues other than smoking one cigarette packet a day over the span of 25 years. The patient presented with 5 days of abnormal movements in bilateral arms following the COVID vaccination. They were described as brief, involuntary jerking, like in sleep starts, in the proximal part of their upper members, and his face with a regular tremor in his arms exacerbated by movements and emotion. His movement disorder worsened the second day, and he developed an abnormal gait with slurred speech, concomitantly with diarrhea. Seven days following the symptoms onset, the patient was alert. His neurological exam revealed multifocal myoclonic jerks affecting four limbs predominantly proximal, the face, and the trunk (video 1). The myoclonic jerks were sensitive to tactile and auditory stimuli, without enhanced startle response or hyperekplexia. His gait was unsteady due to severe myoclonus, without cerebellar ataxia (video 2) and he had mild dysarthria. No dysmetria at the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were found. Examination of eye movements revealed paralysis of Down-Gaze and no opsoclonus was detected. Physical exam was unremarkable, including lack of fever and meningitis signs. The electroencephalogram (EEG) did not show any abnormalities concomitant with myoclonic jerks (Fig.1). The cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was normal (Fig. 2). An extensive biological work-up including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an arterial blood gas analysis, a urine drug screen, a thyroid function test, a vitamin B12, folate, and ammonia level, and HIV and syphilis serologies were inconclusive. Testing for autoimmune and paraneoplastic antineuronal antibodies including anti-NMDA-R was negative. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study was unremarkable (0.3 g/l of proteinorachia, 1 white blood cell). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 through PCR for viral RNA from the nasopharyngeal swab. After the administration of 12mg/day of Dexamethasone for 3 days, along with clonazepam and levetiracetam, the patient's symptoms started improving on day 3 and he displayed a very slow but progressive recovery. Our patient presented with acute isolated multifocal myoclonus status without cognitive impairment. These movements were prominent, spontaneous, worsened by action, and sensitive to touch and sound. The anatomical source of this myoclonus could be cortical or subcortical despite the absence of evident EEG discharges. Several diseases can cause acute myoclonus such as severe hypoxia, metabolic disturbances, and paraneoplastic syndromes. these diagnoses were ruled out in our patient. Post-vaccinal origin was also suggested, but its accountability was not proven. Thus, the two hypothetic etiologies raised were either para-infectious or infectious mechanisms in relation to SARS-Cov 2 infection. HIV, VZV, HSV, and syphilis infections were eliminated and the patient tested positive for SARS-Cov2 infection. In the literature, COVID-19-related myoclonus was reported as a complication of an already-known SARS-CoV-2 infection in about 50 patients so far. It generally occurs between 6 days and 26 days following the SARS-CoV-2 infection [2-5], and affects critical illness patients with cognitive decline, mainly from the intensive care unit [3,4]. Yet, our patient did not display any symptoms of COVID-19 infection before the occurrence of these abnormal movements. Furthermore, he had a relatively good general condition and no cognitive impairment. Several pathophysiological mechanisms were suggested regarding the COVID-19-related myoclonus. Either central nervous invasion by SARS-Cov 2 after transneuronal spread and/or auto-immune cross-reactivity reaction, are likely incriminated in the pathophysiology of most of the cases [6]. We believe that there is an inflammatory process involved with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and systemic inflammation, including cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome targeting the brain and more specifically the cortex and basal ganglia [6]. Data collection in clinical registries is needed to increase our knowledge of the prevalence of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and will hopefully clarify the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-COVID-19 myoclonic syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2022.11.010,PMC9678388,COVID19; Movement disorders; Myoclonus; SARS-CoV-2,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
37772307,Late Presentation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in a Former Association Football Player.,"Cullinane, Patrick W; Wrigley, Sarah; Bradshaw, Teisha Y; Shaw, Karen; Shribman, Samuel; de Pablo Fernandez, Eduardo; Warner, Thomas T; Jaunmuktane, Zane",Cullinane,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by widespread accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau that typically occurs in people who have suffered repetitive head impacts. To date, very few cases have been reported in association football players. To describe the clinicopathological features of a case of CTE in an 84-year-old former football player who was clinically diagnosed as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A retrospective review of the patient's primary care and hospital medical records was performed along with a comprehensive neuropathological examination. This patient presented at age 84 with symmetrical parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that was exacerbated by prochlorperazine. His condition was rapidly progressive with recurrent falls within 1 year. Other features included headaches, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, disturbed sleep and aggression. He received a clinical diagnosis of DLB and died approximately 2 years after the onset of symptoms. A post-mortem examination revealed stage 4 CTE. While the contemporaneous onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms in the context of possible neuroleptic sensitivity is suggestive of DLB, the additional symptoms of aggressive behavior, depression and suicidality in a former football player are consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE. This case, which is notable for the late presentation, demonstrates that CTE may masquerade as other dementias and highlights the importance of seeking a history of repetitive head impacts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Movement disorders clinical practice,10.1002/mdc3.13829,PMC10525051,chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia with Lewy bodies; football; pathology; soccer,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, neuroimaging, and outcome characteristics in a case series of patients with lesional RBD. This is a retrospective case series from a tertiary care referral center. A total of 10 patients with lesional RBD were identified. Seven (70%) were men, with an average age of sleep symptom onset of 53.7 ± 17.0 years. Structural pathology evident on neuroimaging included four extraaxial (three meningiomas and one basilar fusiform aneurysm with brainstem compression) and six intraaxial (encephalomalacia, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and leukodystrophy) lesions. No patient developed parkinsonian features or cognitive impairment suggestive of synucleinopathy over an average of 45.4 ± 35.2 months of follow-up. RBD is rarely associated with non-synuclein structural lesions affecting the pons, medulla, or limbic system.

22764352,[Neurological disease and facial recognition].,"Kawamura, Mitsuru; Sugimoto, Azusa; Kobayakawa, Mutsutaka; Tsuruya, Natsuko",Kawamura,"To discuss the neurological basis of facial recognition, we present our case reports of impaired recognition and a review of previous literature. First, we present a case of infarction and discuss prosopagnosia, which has had a large impact on face recognition research. From a study of patient symptoms, we assume that prosopagnosia may be caused by unilateral right occipitotemporal lesion and right cerebral dominance of facial recognition. Further, circumscribed lesion and degenerative disease may also cause progressive prosopagnosia. Apperceptive prosopagnosia is observed in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), pathologically considered as Alzheimer's disease, and associative prosopagnosia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Second, we discuss face recognition as part of communication. Patients with Parkinson disease show social cognitive impairments, such as difficulty in facial expression recognition and deficits in theory of mind as detected by the reading the mind in the eyes test. Pathological and functional imaging studies indicate that social cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease is possibly related to damages in the amygdalae and surrounding limbic system. The social cognitive deficits can be observed in the early stages of Parkinson disease, and even in the prodromal stage, for example, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show impairment in facial expression recognition. Further, patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1), which is a multisystem disease that mainly affects the muscles, show social cognitive impairment similar to that of Parkinson disease. Our previous study showed that facial expression recognition impairment of DM 1 patients is associated with lesion in the amygdalae and insulae. Our study results indicate that behaviors and personality traits in DM 1 patients, which are revealed by social cognitive impairment, are attributable to dysfunction of the limbic system.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Acute episodes are also seen with withdrawal from alcohol or sedative-hypnotics, and the use of tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants. In this article, we present a case of olanzapine treatment of a patient with cerebrovascular disease with psychobehavioural symptoms. The patient was an elderly patient who developed psychobehavioural symptoms after a sudden cerebral infarction. Initially, his symptoms improved when he took olanzapine (5 mg orally once/night). However, the patient subsequently developed symptoms of hypersomnia when he continued to take olanzapine, and the symptoms of hypersomnia gradually worsened as the dose of olanzapine was gradually increased. Benzodiazepines are often used to treat anomalous sleep, and clonazepam is one of the commonly prescribed drugs. In this case, the patient's abnormal sleep behavior was alleviated after treatment with clonazepam. As an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine has been reported to cause abnormal sleep behavior during clinical use, and only one case has been reported in China.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) was diagnosed and treated. Because of persistent EDS, snoring and nycturia, a nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) was performed. PSG showed high sleep fragmentation related to a moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) was proposed. Because of the persistence of abnormal nocturnal behaviours, characterized by screaming, punching and falling out of bed, a video-PSG with CPAP treatment was performed. The recording showed typical chin electromyography (EMG) activity increase associated with violent movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorders (RBD). Clinical neurological examination found no parkinsonian syndrome, no dysautonomic sign and no neurological focal sign. Dopamine transporter imaging [123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] did not find any presynaptic dopaminergic pathways degeneration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a vascular lesion suggestive of cavernoma located in the pons.

Encephalitis manifested with persistent hiccups, seizures and impairment of consciousness. After 2 weeks, the initial neurologic symptoms subsided and the patient progressively developed movement disorders (rigidity and bradykinesia, resistant to L-DOPA), lethargy and behavioral hypersomnia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thalamic and hippocampal signal abnormalities, immunohistochemistry on a mouse brain substrate revealed serum autoantibodies binding to the brainstem neuropil. Polysomnographic monitoring was consistent with a very severe disruption of sleep: the sleep-wake cycle was fragmented, and the NREM-REM ultradian cycle was irregular. Intravenous immune globulin therapy resulted in the complete reversal of the movement and the sleep disorders. Our observation confirms that parkinsonism and sleep disorders may be consequences of encephalitis, that an immune-mediated pathogenesis is likely, and, consequently, that immunotherapy can be beneficial in these patients. The polysomnographic monitoring suggests that lethargia, rather than a mere hypersomnia, is the result of a combination between sleep disruption and altered motor control.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059416645706,,encephalitis; encephalitis lethargica; hypersomnia; immunoglobuline; polysomnography; post-encephalitic parkinsonism; sleep,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
25239855,Cingulate neglect in humans: disruption of contralesional reward learning in right brain damage.,"Lecce, Francesca; Rotondaro, Francesca; Bonnì, Sonia; Carlesimo, Augusto; Thiebaut de Schotten, Michel; Tomaiuolo, Francesco; Doricchi, Fabrizio",Lecce,"Motivational valence plays a key role in orienting spatial attention. Nonetheless, clinical documentation and understanding of motivationally based deficits of spatial orienting in the human is limited. Here in a series of one group-study and two single-case studies, we have examined right brain damaged patients (RBD) with and without left spatial neglect in a spatial reward-learning task, in which the motivational valence of the left contralesional and the right ipsilesional space was contrasted. In each trial two visual boxes were presented, one to the left and one to the right of central fixation. In one session monetary rewards were released more frequently in the box on the left side (75% of trials) whereas in another session they were released more frequently on the right side. In each trial patients were required to: 1) point to each one of the two boxes; 2) choose one of the boxes for obtaining monetary reward; 3) report explicitly the position of reward and whether this position matched or not the original choice. Despite defective spontaneous allocation of attention toward the contralesional space, RBD patients with left spatial neglect showed preserved contralesional reward learning, i.e., comparable to ipsilesional learning and to reward learning displayed by patients without neglect. A notable exception in the group of neglect patients was L.R., who showed no sign of contralesional reward learning in a series of 120 consecutive trials despite being able of reaching learning criterion in only 20 trials in the ipsilesional space. L.R. suffered a cortical-subcortical brain damage affecting the anterior components of the parietal-frontal attentional network and, compared with all other neglect and non-neglect patients, had additional lesion involvement of the medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and of the adjacent sectors of the corpus callosum. In contrast to his lateralized motivational learning deficit, L.R. had no lateral bias in the early phases of attentional processing as he suffered no contralesional visual or auditory extinction on double simultaneous tachistoscopic and dichotic stimulation and detected, with no exception, single contralesional visual and auditory stimuli. In a separate study, we were able to compare L.R. with another RBD patient, G.P., who had a selective lesion in the right ACC, in the adjacent callosal connections and the medial-basal prefrontal cortex. G.P. had no contralesional neglect and displayed normal reward learning both in the left and right side of space. These findings show that contralesional reward learning is generally preserved in RBD patients with left spatial neglect and that this can be exploited in rehabilitation protocols. Contralesional reward learning is severely disrupted in neglect patients when an additional lesion of the ACC is present: however, as demonstrated by the comparison between L.R. and G.P. cases, selective unilateral lesion of the right ACC does not produce motivational neglect for the contralesional space.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.008,,Cingulate cortex; Learning; Reward; Right brain damage; Spatial neglect,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Overlapping brainstem regions modulate visual pathways and REM sleep functions via gating of thalamocortical networks. A 66-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed abrupt-onset complex visual hallucinations with preserved insight and violent dream enactment behavior. Brain MRI showed restricted diffusion in the left rostrodorsal pons suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was diagnosed on polysomnography. We investigated the integrity of ponto-geniculate-occipital circuits with seed-based resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) in this patient compared to 46 controls. Rs-fcMRI revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the lesion and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), and between LGN and visual association cortex compared to controls. Conversely, functional connectivity between brainstem and visual association cortex, and between visual association cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in the patient. Focal damage to the rostrodorsal pons is sufficient to cause RBD and PH in humans, suggesting an overlapping mechanism in both syndromes. This lesion produced a pattern of altered functional connectivity consistent with disrupted visual cortex connectivity via de-afferentation of thalamocortical pathways.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.10.015,PMC4820074,Hallucinations; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Lesion; Lewy body dementia; Pareidolia; Parkinson's disease; Prefrontal cortex; Resting state fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

His nocturnal behavior was screaming, thrashing of arms, punching or kicking his spouse, and falling out of bed associated with nightmares of being attacked by what he described as, ""terrible animals frightening me."" No remarkable neurological signs were found. Brain MRI was performed on this patient and it revealed a lacunar ischemic infarct in the right paramedian pons. On the nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), there was phasic submental and limb electromyographic (EMG) tone and an absence of electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity during REM sleep. Hence, this patient was diagnosed with pontine infarction and RBD. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25mg nightly resulted in the disappearance of nocturnal events.

Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6-12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. His movement disorder-specific neural IgG profile revealed ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) and KLHL-11-IgG. Both are biomarkers of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. KLCHL-11-IgG has been reported to accompany germ cell tumors, which was found in a solitary metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node in our patient, along with an atrophic left testis.

The behavioral effects of RSD include the enhancement of motivational and ""drive""-related behaviors. In laboratory animals, RSD has been reported to increase appetite, sexual behavior, aggressiveness, and locomotor activity. Moreover, RSD reportedly improves mood in patients with endogenous depression and heightens appetite and sexual interest in normal subjects. Since ""drive""-related behaviors are thought to involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites, RSD may enhance motivational behaviors through an action on limbic dopaminergic functions. In the present communication, we present two patients (one with multiple sclerosis and the other with Parkinson's disease) in whom treatment with magnetic fields produced behavioral effects which paralleled those observed in REM-sleep-deprived animals and humans. We propose, therefore, that the behavioral and mental effects of treatment with magnetic fields may be mediated via RSD and, by inference, involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459209003278,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Three LBD patients with tool use disorders, three right brain-damaged (RBD) patients, and six matched healthy controls performed a novel tool selection task, consisting in extracting a target out from a box by selecting the relevant tool among eight, four, or two tools. Three criteria were manipulated to make relevant and irrelevant tools (size, rigidity, shape).

All participants committed more errors for selecting relevant tools based on rigidity and shape than size. In some LBD patients, the difficulties persisted even in the 2-Choice condition.

However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process.

9159730,Clinical features and management of two cases of encephalitis lethargica.,"Blunt, S B; Lane, R J; Turjanski, N; Perkin, G D",Blunt,"Two patients with presumed encephalitis lethargica are presented with clinical features suggestive of two forms of the disease described by Von Economo: One patient had a psychosis and a mute-akinetic syndrome associated with myoclonus. The second patient presented with a psychosis and fever, developing severe dyskinesias involving the mouth, trunk and limbs, together with respiratory irregularities and presumed hypothalamic disturbance and disturbance of consciousness. In both cases, initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed an elevated white cell count (predominantly lymphocytes), elevated protein in case 2, and oligoclonal bands in both cases. Computed tomography (CT) brain scan was normal but in both cases EEG revealed diffuse slow wave activity. A 18F-Dopa positron emission tomography (PET) scan in case 2 was normal. The medical management of both patients is discussed. In case 1, L-Dopa improved the akinesia, while the myoclonus responded to clonazepam. In case 2, the severe dyskinesias failed to respond to a number of drugs, and she ultimately required paralysis to relieve her almost continuous movements. Both patients responded rapidly and dramatically to intravenous methylprednisolone.

Tactile stimuli were detected and localized by verbal report, whereas gustatory stimuli were identified by pointing to the corresponding name on cards bearing the names of the three tastes. In the tactile test, 9 of 18 RBD patients showed extinction of left hemitongue stimuli, whereas the remaining RBD patients, 9 LBD patients and 14 healthy subjects detected virtually all stimuli in all conditions. In the gustatory test, healthy subjects outperformed the two brain damaged groups which nevertheless responded well above chance and did not differ from one another. Unexpectedly, the nine RBD patients with left hemitongue tactile extinction showed no gustatory extinction, since performance did not differ significantly between the two hemitongues on both unilateral and bilateral stimulations. To account for these findings, some evidence suggests that the tongue representation is bilateral in both modalities, but predominantly ipsilateral in the gustatory modality and predominantly contralateral in the tactile modality. The RBD patients with left hemitongue tactile extinction were those with more marked symptoms of left-sided extinction in the visual and auditory modalities, making it likely that their brain damage was also responsible for left lingual tactile extinction. The absence of left gustatory extinction in those patients can be attributed to the predominant channelling of left hemitongue taste inputs into the intact left hemisphere.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.01.003,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Analysis of ventilatory response to CO2 before and after morphine demonstrated a depression of ventilatory response (49 to 53% of baseline) and occlusion pressure response (35 to 50% of baseline) to CO2, with a requirement for high doses of naloxone (10 mg IV) to reverse the effect. Polysomnography revealed sustained hyperventilation, elevated O2 saturation, and low end-tidal CO2 throughout all stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Ocular motor evaluation disclosed absence of horizontal and reflexive saccades with compensatory head thrusts. Correlation of the clinical and physiologic data with the MRI abnormalities suggested that the lesion responsible for CNH in this patient might reside in the medial tegmental parapontine reticular formation.

In the present research, we tested two right brain-damaged (RBD) patients to find out whether changing the position of the hands in space influences tactile extinction and denial of ownership to the same extent. Results showed that manipulation of the spatial position of the hands reduces tactile extinction but leaves denial of ownership of the left hand unaffected. Such a dissociation suggests that delusional misperceptions may be independent from somatic neglect and that representation of hands in space and attribution of ownership are dynamically mapped in at least partly separate neural substrates.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490894020,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Electropolygraphic records (EEG, EOG, EMG of chin muscles, ECG) during spontaneous nocturnal sleep were obtained before therapy and after one month haloperidol treatment. The EEGs from bilateral fronto-central derivations were also recorded on magnetic tape to allow spectral analysis and automatic spindle detection by means of digital filtering. The pattern of spindle appearance rate for each stage 2 and 3 NonREM sleep in each night was investigated. We obtained: spindling index, that is the ratio between total spindle duration and sleep stage length, the mean number of spindle bursts/min, the average duration of sleep spindles, the mean amplitude, the mean time between spindles. Before therapy polygraphic records showed short total sleep time, a prolonged sleep latency, the lack of slow waves sleep and of REM sleep. After haloperidol treatment these parameters improved: total sleep time was longer, sleep latency shorter, slow waves sleep and REM sleep appeared. Before treatment spindle activity predominated in the left hemisphere - homolaterally to the subthalamic nucleus damage -, where the spindling index was higher, the mean number of spindle bursts/min larger, the mean time between spindles lower.
