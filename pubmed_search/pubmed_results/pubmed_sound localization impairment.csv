10440071,Neglect without extinction.,"Cocchini, G; Cubelli, R; Della Sala, S; Beschin, N",Cocchini,"A patient, AB, is reported who showed clear signs of neglect but no extinction (N+ E-). Several hypotheses proposed to account for this dissociation were put to the test. The postulated association between motor neglect and extinction did not hold good, nor did the possibility that the N+ E- dissociation may be traced back to the difference in test requirements and therefore observed only in patients with object-centred neglect. Likewise, manipulating the physical features of the stimuli (relative size, exposure time, presentation synchrony) did not elicit extinction. However, when the task demands were modified by asking the patient to perform a further spatial analysis of the stimuli, rather than simply detect them, extinction emerged. Since AB performed well on several neglect tasks requiring parallel processing, while failing all tasks calling for serial processing, the hypothesis is put forward that AB's N+ E- dissociation could be interpreted within the parallel/serial distinction framework.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70802-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Italy,eng
26586155,A selective impairment of perception of sound motion direction in peripheral space: A case study.,"Thaler, Lore; Paciocco, Joseph; Daley, Mark; Lesniak, Gabriella D; Purcell, David W; Fraser, J Alexander; Dutton, Gordon N; Rossit, Stephanie; Goodale, Melvyn A; Culham, Jody C",Thaler,"It is still an open question if the auditory system, similar to the visual system, processes auditory motion independently from other aspects of spatial hearing, such as static location. Here, we report psychophysical data from a patient (female, 42 and 44 years old at the time of two testing sessions), who suffered a bilateral occipital infarction over 12 years earlier, and who has extensive damage in the occipital lobe bilaterally, extending into inferior posterior temporal cortex bilaterally and into right parietal cortex. We measured the patient's spatial hearing ability to discriminate static location, detect motion and perceive motion direction in both central (straight ahead), and right and left peripheral auditory space (50° to the left and right of straight ahead). Compared to control subjects, the patient was impaired in her perception of direction of auditory motion in peripheral auditory space, and the deficit was more pronounced on the right side. However, there was no impairment in her perception of the direction of auditory motion in central space. Furthermore, detection of motion and discrimination of static location were normal in both central and peripheral space. The patient also performed normally in a wide battery of non-spatial audiological tests. Our data are consistent with previous neuropsychological and neuroimaging results that link posterior temporal cortex and parietal cortex with the processing of auditory motion. Most importantly, however, our data break new ground by suggesting a division of auditory motion processing in terms of speed and direction and in terms of central and peripheral space.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.11.008,,Lesion; Occipital cortex; Parietal cortex; Psychophysics; Sound motion; Spatial hearing,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 36-year-old right-handed man had an intracerebral hemorrhage circumscribed to the right inferior colliculus. Following recovery from the acute phase, he had only residual left ear tinnitus and left trochlear palsy and no hearing loss. Microscopic imaging analysis on a 7 T magnetic resonance imaging system demonstrated a chronic lesion confined primarily to the right central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. Sound localization was significantly impaired in the contralateral hemispace. The case confirms prior clinical reports of unilateral inferior colliculus dysfunction, the specific anatomic characterization of which was demonstrated in this case by magnetic resonance microscopy. It furthermore supports the notion that central nucleus of the inferior colliculus dysfunction can produce tinnitus and sound localization deficits, without hearing loss.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,SAGE open medical case reports,10.1177/2050313X17745209,PMC5721957,7 T; Central nucleus of the inferior colliculus; magnetic resonance microscopy; sound localization; tinnitus,Case Reports,England,eng
12031527,Functional role of the human inferior colliculus in binaural hearing.,"Litovsky, Ruth Y; Fligor, Brian J; Tramo, Mark J",Litovsky,"Psychophysical experiments were carried out in a rare case involving a 48 year old man (RJC) with a small traumatic hemorrhage of the right dorsal midbrain, including the inferior colliculus (IC). RJC had normal audiograms bilaterally, but there was a marked decrease in wave V amplitude on click-evoked brainstem auditory evoked potentials following left ear stimulation. RJC demonstrated a deficit in sound localization identification when the loudspeakers lay within the auditory hemifield contralateral to his IC lesion. Errors showed a consistent bias towards the hemifield ipsilateral to the lesion. Echo suppression was abnormally weak compared with that seen in control subjects, but only for sources contralateral to the lesion. Finally, speech intelligibility tests showed normal ability to benefit from spatial separation of target and competing speech sources. These results suggest that: (1) localizing sounds within a given hemifield relies on the integrity of the contralateral IC, (2) unilateral IC lesions give the illusion that sound sources in the 'bad' hemifield are displaced towards the 'good' hemifield, (3) the IC mediates aspects of echo suppression, and (4) lesion in the IC does not impede spatial release from masking in speech intelligibility, possibly due to that ability being more heavily mediated by cortical regions.",{},,Hearing research,10.1016/s0378-5955(02)00304-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng
9183249,Spatial and temporal auditory processing deficits following right hemisphere infarction. A psychophysical study.,"Griffiths, T D; Rees, A; Witton, C; Cross, P M; Shakir, R A; Green, G G",Griffiths,"Higher auditory function in a patient was investigated following a right hemisphere infarction between the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories involving the insula. The patient complained of lack of musical appreciation and a battery of tests confirmed a dissociated receptive musical deficit in the presence of normal appreciation of environmental sounds and speech. The ability to detect continuous changes in sound frequency in the form of sinusoidal frequency modulation was preserved. There was, however, a deficit in the analysis of rapid temporal sequences of notes which could underlie his musical deficit. This case provides further evidence for the existence of amusia as a distinct form of auditory agnosia, but does not support the hypothesis that bilateral lesions are required to produce such a deficit. Unexpectedly, the patient was also found to have a deficit in the perception of apparent sound-source movement. We suggest that this deficit is analogous to the visual phenomenon of akinetopsia, and is in accord with PET work suggesting involvement of areas outside primary auditory cortex in sound movement perception. A possible common deficit in auditory temporal and spatial 'scene analysis' is discussed.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/120.5.785,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11320157,Auditory peripersonal space in humans: a case of auditory-tactile extinction.,"Làdavas, E; Pavani, F; Farnè, A",Làdavas,"Animal experiments have shown that the spatial correspondence between auditory and tactile receptive fields of ventral pre-motor neurons provides a map of auditory peripersonal space around the head. This allows neurons to localize a near sound with respect to the head. In the present study, we demonstrated the existence of an auditory peripersonal space around the head in humans. In a right-brain damaged patient with tactile extinction, a sound delivered near the ipsilesional side of the head extinguished a tactile stimulus delivered to the contralesional side of the head (cross-modal auditory-tactile extinction). In contrast, when an auditory stimulus was presented far from the head, cross-modal extinction was dramatically reduced. This spatially specific cross-modal extinction was found only when a complex sound like a white noise burst was presented; pure tones did not produce spatially specific cross-modal extinction. These results show a high degree of functional similarity between the characteristics of the auditory peripersonal space representation in humans and monkeys. This similarity suggests that analogous physiological substrates might be responsible for coding this multisensory integrated representation of peripersonal space in human and non-human primates.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.2.97,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11287368,Two types of auditory neglect.,"Bellmann, A; Meuli, R; Clarke, S",Bellmann,"Auditory neglect, defined as inattention to stimuli within the left hemispace, is mostly reported in association with left ear extinction in dichotic listening. However, it remains disputed as to how far dichotic extinction reflects a primary attentional deficit and is thus appropriate for the diagnosis of auditory neglect. We report here on four patients who presented left ear extinction in dichotic listening following right unilateral hemispheric lesions. Auditory spatial attention was assessed with two additional tasks: (i) diotic test by means of interaural time differences (ITDs), simulating bilateral simultaneous spatial presentation of the dichotic tasks without the inconvenience of interaural intensity or content difference; and (ii) sound localization. A hemispatial asymmetry on the ITD diotic test or a spatial bias on sound localization were found to be part of auditory neglect. Two patients (J.C.N. and M.B.) presented a marked hemispatial asymmetry favouring the ipsilesional hemispace in the ITD diotic test, but did not show any spatial bias in sound localization. Two other patients (A.J. and E.S.) had the reverse profile: no hemispatial asymmetry in the ITD diotic test, but a severe spatial bias directed to the ipsilesional side in sound localization. J.C.N. and M.B. had mainly subcortical lesions affecting the basal ganglia. A.J. and E.S. had cortical lesions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal areas. Thus, there are two behaviourally and anatomically distinct types of auditory neglect characterized by: (i) deficit in allocation of auditory spatial attention following lesions centred on basal ganglia; or (ii) distortion of auditory spatial representation following frontotemporoparietal lesions.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.4.676,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
12753964,Preserved use of spatial cues for sound segregation in a case of spatial deafness.,"Thiran, Anne Bellmann; Clarke, Stephanie",Thiran,"Auditory spatial cues contribute to sound localisation and to sound object segregation. We have investigated these capacities in a patient (NM) who complained having difficulties to localise sounds in everyday life after a right temporo-parieto-frontal ischemic lesion. Two groups of tasks were used, in which spatial dimension was simulated by interaural time differences (ITD): (i) active localisation of stationary or moving sound targets, and (ii) sound segregation on the basis of spatial cues. This latter included a spatial release from masking paradigm and two ITD diotic tasks. NM failed to localise stationary and moving sounds: she perceived all the stimuli at the centre of the head, and could not differentiate stationary from moving targets. In contrast, NM was able to use ITD cues to segregate simultaneous sound sources in the spatial-release-from-masking paradigm and in ITD diotic tasks.These results suggest that sound localisation and sound object segregation based on spatial cues do not rely on the same mechanisms.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00014-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

19031339,Spatial gradient for unique-feature detection in patients with unilateral neglect: evidence from auditory and visual search.,"Eramudugolla, Ranmalee; Mattingley, Jason B",Eramudugolla,"Patients with unilateral spatial neglect following right hemisphere damage are impaired in detecting contralesional targets in both visual and haptic search tasks, and often show a graded improvement in detection performance for more ipsilesional spatial locations. In audition, multiple simultaneous sounds are most effectively perceived if they are distributed along the frequency dimension. Thus, attention to spectro-temporal features alone can allow detection of a target sound amongst multiple simultaneous distracter sounds, regardless of whether these sounds are spatially separated. Spatial bias in attention associated with neglect should not affect auditory search based on spectro-temporal features of a sound target. We report that a right brain damaged patient with neglect demonstrated a significant gradient favouring the ipsilesional side on a visual search task as well as an auditory search task in which the target was a frequency modulated tone amongst steady distractor tones. No such asymmetry was apparent in the auditory search performance of a control patient with a right hemisphere lesion but no neglect. The results suggest that the spatial bias in attention exhibited by neglect patients affects stimulus processing even when spatial information is irrelevant to the task.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802570472,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
10936912,Auditory and visual spatial localization deficits following bilateral parietal lobe lesions in a patient with Balint's syndrome.,"Phan, M L; Schendel, K L; Recanzone, G H; Robertson, L C",Phan,"Lesion and electrophysiological studies indicate that the parietal lobes play a role in visual spatial attention and in computing the spatial coordinates of visual input. Fewer studies have investigated the role of the parietal lobe in auditory spatial processing, and an extensive comparison of visual and auditory spatial processing in humans with parietal lobe lesions has yet to be conducted. We have studied such localization abilities in a Balint's syndrome patient (RM) who has bilateral parietal lobe lesions. The results indicated that this patient had a significant deficit in both visual and auditory localization relative to age-matched controls. Unlike the controls, however, RM's auditory localization ability either matched or exceeded his visual localization ability depending on the task. Accordingly, RM exhibited ""auditory capture,"" but not ""visual capture"" under conditions where control subjects showed the opposite pattern. These results are consistent with hypotheses that the parietal lobes are involved in creating multiple spatial representations and in shifting from one spatial reference point to another, but suggest that these parietal structures are not necessary for the integration of multiple sensory stimuli resulting in capture effects.",{},,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/089892900562354,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng
2423648,Word deafness: one hundred years later.,"Buchman, A S; Garron, D C; Trost-Cardamone, J E; Wichter, M D; Schwartz, M",Buchman,"Since its original description the diagnosis of word deafness has been greatly expanded. Confusion has arisen with regard to the usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term ""word deafness"" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits. Impairment of musical abilities parallels the severity of the auditory disorder.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.49.5.489,PMC1028802,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Listeners reported sound location by pointing with their dominant hand to the apparent sound location in an anechoic chamber. Two conditions were tested: (i) localization of a fixed-sound source and (ii) localization of the beginning and the end of a simulated moving stimulus. In both conditions, the responses of the patients were less accurate than those of the controls in the hemifield contralateral to their removed hemisphere. Moreover, the single-case analyses revealed that the performances obtained with fixed sources were generally more precise than those obtained with moving sources. This result is discussed in terms of a differential involvement of cortical and subcortical pathways in the processing of stationary and moving sounds. Finally, the age at surgery and the post-surgical interval were related with the magnitude of the deficits, suggesting the possible influences of functional reorganization and cerebral plasticity.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)90143-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging disclosed partial inferior colliculi destruction and medial geniculate body degeneration. A pure tone audiogram revealed only moderate sensorineural hearing loss, but her speech perception was totally impaired. The binaural sound localization function was also impaired. The auditory brain stem response (ABR) showed waves I, III, and V to have normal latencies. The amplitude of wave III was larger than that of wave V. These results support the view that the waves of the ABR are elicited from multiple sources in the auditory brain stem nuclei and tracts. This case suggests a substantial role for the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body in the processing of speech perception and sound localization.",{},,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",10.1177/000348940010901204,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
11789437,[Central hyperacusis with phonophobia in multiple sclerosis].,"Pfadenhauer, K; Weber, H; Rösler, A; Stöhr, M",Pfadenhauer,"Auditory disturbances are a well known symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Uni- or bilateral hypacusis or deafness in patients with normal auditory testing is considered to be a result of lesions in the central auditory pathway. Only rarely described is a central phonophobia whereby acoustic stimuli induce unpleasant and painful perceptions, with consecutive avoidance of these factors. Our first patient described acute shooting pain in the right cheek, triggered only through the ringing of a telephone. The second patient had uncomfortable perception of nonverbal noise. For example the wrinkling of paper bags was unbearable for him. The third patient had difficulties localizing the source of sound and disturbing echos while listening to speech or music. Clinically, in all patients symptoms of a brainstem syndrome were found, whereas auditory testing including inspection, audiometry, and stapedius reflex was normal. We found pathological acoustic evoked potentials (AEP) in all three patients with a prolonged latency III-V and T2 lesions in the ipsilateral pons and central auditory pathway. In case one, we suppose a lateral spread between the lateral lemniscus and the central trigeminal pathway. In the other cases, a dysfunction of the central sensory modulation which controls the regulation of sensitivity of incoming acoustic stimuli seems to be the cause of hyperacusis. All our patients developed clinically confirmed MS in the further course after suffering from phonophobia as their first symptom.",{},,Der Nervenarzt,10.1007/s001150170005,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger
11335696,Impaired spatial working memory across saccades contributes to abnormal search in parietal neglect.,"Husain, M; Mannan, S; Hodgson, T; Wojciulik, E; Driver, J; Kennard, C",Husain,"Visual neglect of left space following right parietal damage in humans involves a lateral bias in attention, apparent in many search tasks. We hypothesized that parietal neglect may also involve a failure to remember which locations have already been examined during visual search: an impairment in retaining searched locations across saccades. Using a new paradigm, we monitored gaze during search, while simultaneously probing whether observers judged they had found a new target, or judged instead that they were re-fixating a previously examined target. A patient with left neglect following focal right parietal infarction repeatedly re-fixated right locations. Critically, he often failed to remember that these locations had already been searched, treating old targets as new discoveries at an abnormal rate. In comparison, healthy age-matched control subjects rarely re-fixated targets, and mistook old targets as new targets even more rarely. The frequency of such mistakes in the parietal patient, for different conditions, correlated with the severity of his neglect. Control experiments indicated no perceptual localization deficit in non-search tasks. These results suggest a deficit in retaining searched locations across saccades in parietal neglect, in addition to the lateral spatial bias. Moreover, the former deficit exacerbates the latter, such that patients do not realize that the rightward locations favoured by their bias have already been examined during previous fixations and, for this reason, they saccade back to them repeatedly. The combination of the two deficits (a lateral bias plus a deficit in retaining locations already searched) may thus explain the pathological pattern of search that characterizes parietal neglect: why stimuli on the right are re-examined recursively, as if being searched for the first time, and hence why stimuli on the left continue to be ignored even with unlimited viewing time. These proposals accord with recent electrophysiological and functional imaging data, demonstrating posterior parietal involvement in the retention of target locations across saccades.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.5.941,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
