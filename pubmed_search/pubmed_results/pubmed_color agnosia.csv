11557828,Localization of hemiachromatopsia.,"Short, R A; Graff-Radford, N R",Short,"Impaired color perception with relative preservation of form vision (achromatopsia) caused by cerebral lesions was first described over a century ago. However, for many years some researchers questioned the existence of an area of cerebral cortex apart from the primary visual cortex specialized in color processing. The development of sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging techniques has allowed verification of the cortical structures important in color perception. We describe a case of a patient with impaired color perception in one hemifield of vision (hemiachromatopsia) and compare the localization of the lesion with previous cases described in the literature. These cases show that lesions of the ventromedial occipital cortex can impair color perception and leave form vision intact.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.4.331,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
14527501,Transient postoperative prosopagnosia.,"Mesad, Salah; Laff, Rachel; Devinsky, Orrin",Mesad,"A 23-year-old right-handed woman developed isolated transient prosopagnosia following surgical resection of a right posterior temporal seizure focus. At 18 years of age she had developed secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Preoperative neuropsychological evaluation was normal, and neurological examination revealed only a left superior quadrant achromatopsia. MRI revealed a circumscribed lesion in the right inferolateral temporo-occipital junction. Following surgery she was agitated for 36 hours, and afterward, when her attention and orientation improved, she was unable to recognize familiar faces. She could, however, recognize familiar voices. Her prosopagnosia resolved over the next 6-7 days. This case demonstrates that isolated prosopagnosia can occur in patients with lesions restricted to the right inferior posterior temporal-anterior occipital region. The temporary nature of the prosopagnosia may result from postsurgical tissue injury, including focal cerebral edema, with compensation by ipsilateral or contralateral areas.",{},,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,10.1016/j.yebeh.2003.07.012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
34098423,Neural bases of color-specific semantic loss: Two cases of object-color knowledge impairment.,"Oishi, Yuka; Nagasawa, Hikaru; Hirayama, Kazumi; Suzuki, Kyoko",Oishi,"Human color processing includes perception, naming, and knowledge of colors. These facets are dissociable from each other and appear to have discrete neuronal bases. Here, we present two cases with loss of object color knowledge but spared color perception and knowledge of object other than color. Case 1, a stroke patient with lesions in the left medial occipitotemporal lobe, is impaired in associating colors or color names with objects or object names. However, he demonstrated good color perception and well-preserved knowledge of object form, size, and functions. Case 2, another stroke patient with a lesion in the left fusiform and lingual gyri, showed anomia for colors and slight impairment in object color knowledge. Case 1 is the first subject to have complete loss of object color knowledge, including the verbal association between object and color names without impairment in object knowledge about perceptual properties other than color. These results indicate that color and object processing is comprised of numerous dissociable features with distinct neuronal bases. Further, they provide evidence supporting the critical role played by the left medial occipitotemporal region in color knowledge.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.04.014,,Case report; Color agnosia; Color anomia; Color knowledge; Fusiform gyrus,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
30987454,Case of right hemispatial neglect and transcortical sensory aphasia following left occipitotemporoparietal glioblastoma resection.,"DeDios-Stern, Samantha; Durkin, Nicole M; Soble, Jason R",DeDios-Stern,"The neurobehavioral syndrome of hemispatial neglect, which can result from insults such as stroke, brain tumor, or head injury, has most frequently been described as occurring for the left-side of hemispace following lesions to the right hemisphere. While right hemispatial neglect/inattention may occur following left hemisphere lesions as well, it has received limited attention in the scientific literature. The present case describes an inpatient neuropsychological evaluation with a 67-year-old, African American man presenting with right hemispatial neglect following resection of a large glioblastoma in the left occipitotemporoparietal region. The evaluation included a clinical interview, neurobehavioral status examination, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results documented consistent evidence of right hemispatial neglect across the administered tests, which could not be attributed to an established right visual field cut. Neuropsychological testing also revealed nearly global deficits in complex visuoperception, posterior/receptive language, memory, and complex attention/executive functioning abilities, while basic attention remained intact. Further remarkable findings of this case included color anomia and transcortical sensory aphasia. Findings from the case are discussed in the context of the preexisting literature on hemispatial neglect and the theoretical specialization of the parietal lobe for spatial attention/awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Applied neuropsychology.

Patients with cerebral achromatopsia are commonly said to suffer due to their disturbed colour sense. Here, we report the case of a patient with cerebral achromatopsia who was initially unaware of his deficit, although three experiments with eye movement recordings demonstrated his severe inability to use colour information in everyday tasks. During two months, the evolution of his colour vision deficit was followed with repeated standardized colour vision tests and eye movement recordings. While his performance continuously improved, he became more and more aware of the deficit. Only after colour vision had almost normalized, his subjective colour sensation was inconspicuous again. The simultaneous occurrence of achromatopsia and the corresponding anosognosia and their parallel recovery suggest that both deficits were due to dysfunction of the same brain region. Consequently, the subjective experience of colour loss in achromatopsia may depend on the residual function of the damaged colour centre.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.11.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

23687498,"The achromatic 'philosophical zombie', a syndrome of cerebral achromatopsia with color anopsognosia.","Carota, Antonio; Calabrese, Pasquale",Carota,"We describe a patient with persistent cerebral achromatopsia occurring after bilateral occipital strokes. Blinded color recognition was assessed with a computerized experimental paradigm and the patient reported the degree of confidence in the response exactness on a visual percent scale. Color recognition was accurate and above chance (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.002). The degree of confidence in the answers showed a significant correlation with recognition scores (Spearman rank order correlation, p < 0.0001). These findings constitute the exceptional condition of what we called color anopsognosia (not knowing of seeing colors) and recall the theoretic figure of the 'philosophical zombie'.

23473619,The anatomy of cerebral achromatopsia: a reappraisal and comparison of two case reports.,"Bartolomeo, Paolo; Bachoud-Lévi, Anne-Catherine; Thiebaut de Schotten, Michel",Bartolomeo,"Brain damage can produce acquired deficits of color perception, or cerebral achromatopsia. In these patients, lesions tend to overlap on a restricted region in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, close to the reported locations of the putative V4 complex and to foci of increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity related to color perception in normal participants. Unilateral lesions give rise to achromatopsia in the contralateral visual field (hemiachromatopsia). Here we present a partial English translation of the first case report of a hemiachromatopsic patient with detailed anatomical evidence (Madame R., Verrey, 1888), and discuss these results in relation to a more recent case report (Madame D., Bartolomeo et al., 1997) of a patient with two consecutive hemorrhagic lesions in the occipitotemporal regions of the two hemispheres. Strikingly, Madame D. developed full-field achromatopsia after the second lesion in the right hemisphere, without having shown any signs of hemiachromatopsia after the first lesion in the left hemisphere. Thanks to the comparison of the reconstructed lesion patterns between the two patients and with the putative location of color-related areas in the human brain, we offer a possible, if speculative, account of this puzzling pattern of anatomo-clinical correlations, based on intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2013.01.013,,Achromatopsia; Brain damage; Color processing; Occipital lobe; Temporal lobe,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

On post-partum day 1, she complained of achromatopsia, stating: ""all things look brownish-gray"". Ophthalmologic examination was normal, but brain magnetic resonance imaging showed occipital lobe lesions, indicative of PRES, and, interestingly, also color vision center (area V4) lesions, suggesting that the achromatopsia had been caused by brain damage.

23528139,Alexia due to ischemic stroke of the visual word form area.,"Turkeltaub, Peter E; Goldberg, Ethan M; Postman-Caucheteux, Whitney A; Palovcak, Merisa; Quinn, Colin; Cantor, Charles; Coslett, H Branch",Turkeltaub,"The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region in the posterior left occipitotemporal cortex adjacent to the fusiform gyrus hypothesized to mediate word recognition. Evidence supporting the role of this area in reading comes from neuroimaging studies of normal subjects, case-controlled lesion studies, and studies of patients with surgical resection of the VWFA for tumors or epilepsy. Based on these prior reports, a small discrete lesion to the VWFA would be expected to cause alexia in a literate person without prior brain process, but such a case has not previously been reported to our knowledge. Here, we report the case of a previously-healthy 63-year-old man with the acute onset of alexia without other significant impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a small ischemic stroke localized to the inferior left occipitotemporal cortex, corresponding to the approximate location of the putative VWFA. Characteristic of pure alexia, testing in the weeks following the stroke revealed a letter-by-letter reading strategy and a word length effect on single word reading. Formal visual field testing was normal. There was no color anomia, or object or face recognition deficits, although a mild agraphia may have been present. This case of acute-onset alexia in a previously normal individual due to a small stroke restricted to the VWFA and sparing occipital cortex and white matter pathways supports the conclusion that the VWFA is crucial for reading.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770873,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, functional changes in the brain have been rarely assessed by electrophysiological methods. We carried out electrophysiological examinations on a 23-year-old man with associative visual agnosia, prosopagnosia and cerebral achromatopsia to evaluate the higher brain dysfunctions of visual recognition. Electrophysiological methods consisted of achromatic, chromatic and category-specific visual evoked potentials (CS-VEPs), and event-related potentials (ERPs) with color and motion discrimination tasks. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed large white matter lesions in the bilateral temporo-occipital lobes involving the lingual and fusiform gyri (V4) and inferior longitudinal fasciculi due to multiple sclerosis. Examinations including CS-VEPs demonstrated dysfunctions of face and object perception while sparing semantic word perception after primary visual cortex (V1) in the ventral pathway. ERPs showed abnormal color perception in the ventral pathway with normal motion perception in the dorsal pathway. These electrophysiological findings were consistent with lesions in the ventral pathway that were detected by clinical and neuroimaging findings. Therefore, CS-VEPs and ERPs with color and motion discrimination tasks are useful methods for assessing the functional changes of visual recognition such as visual agnosia.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2004.03.024,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/4.5.555,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

This effect is generally thought to be mediated by primary visual cortex (V1) although this has remained the subject of some debate. To determine whether V1 is in fact sufficient to subserve the ME, we compared McCollough adaptation in controls to adaptation in two patients with damage to ventrotemporal cortex, resulting in achromatopsia, but who have spared V1. Each of these patients has some residual colour abilities of which he is unaware. Participants performed a 2AFC orientation-discrimination task for pairs of oblique and vertical/horizontal gratings both before and after adaptation to red/green oblique induction gratings. Successful ME induction would manifest itself as an improvement in oblique-orientation discrimination owing to the additional colour cue after adaptation. Indeed, in controls oblique grating discrimination improved post-adaptation. Further, a subdivision of our control group demonstrated successful ME induction despite a lack of conscious awareness of the added colour cue, indicating that conscious colour awareness is not required for ME induction. The patients, however, did not show improvement in oblique-orientation discrimination, indicating a lack of ME induction.

The patient showed superior altitudinal hemianopsia, alexia, prosopagnosia, cerebral achromatopsia, and object agnosia. Elementary perception and information processing supposed to be executed by the stream to the parietal lobe were intact, since he was able to perceive the position and speed of moving object (catching the flying ball). He could not categorize neither real objects nor line drawings by sight. However, copying and matching of them was accurate, suggesting that his agnosia was an associative type (Lissauer). Detailed neuropsychological examinations revealed that his agnosia was due to a disturbance in integrating local form features into a perceptual whole. In addition, this patient showed difficulty in retrieval of objects from memory. However, it is unlikely that this disturbance itself was a cause of this particular form of agnosia.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

I].","Jaeger, W; Krastel, H; Braun, S",Jaeger,"To the patient, the sudden onset of cerebral achromatopsia is like switching to black and white on a color TV. As a rule, the defect arises due to bilateral ischemic infarction in the inferior occipitotemporal region. Bilateral upper homonymous quadrantanopsias usually leave the macula more or less unimpaired, so that visual acuity is largely preserved. Prosopagnosia and loss of topographic memory are often associated with central achromatopsia. Investigations of color vision must include color-naming procedures and largefield tests in addition to the conventional methods. Color-naming tasks are indispensable in differentiating cerebral achromatopsia from the aphasic and disconnective types of color anomia. The authors' recommended strategy for investigating color vision relies on records of a case of cerebral achromatopsia obtained six months and two years, respectively, after the onset of symptoms. In addition to the above-mentioned procedures, spectral increment thresholds on white and colored backgrounds were determined. For the first time in cerebral achromatopsia, examinations with large-field spectral matches were performed using the projection anomaloscope. Large-field tests are indispensable for monitoring recovery in cases of central achromatopsia. In the author's patient, recovery of blue-green discrimination was far more complete than that of red-yellow-green discrimination, and for both conditions large-field color vision was far superior to small-field.",{},,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,10.1055/s-2008-1050309,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger

However, this deficit is more common when associated with other behavioral disturbances that result from trauma or cerebral infarction to the posterior cerebral hemispheres. Two cases presented with alexia without agraphia following infarction within the posterior cerebral artery territory. Because of initial confusion and disorientation the patients were diagnosed as demented and unsuitable for rehabilitation. Both subjects had a visual field deficit and color agnosia. Prosopagnosia, simultanagnosia, and ataxia of visual-motor control were also present. The second case was unusual because of pure word blindness associated with a right occipital lobe lesion.

His intelligence and memory were deteriorated moderately. He failed to notice objects located in the affected visual field, because of his severely impaired visual search. When ordinary lighting was used, he showed severe right-sided omissions on the line cancellation test. However, omissions were less marked under the brighter lighting. By using a modified method of Kerkhoff and Vianen (1994), he was trained to make saccadic eye movements toward affected regions to find a target and to search and point at targets arranged randomly. As the sensitivity for contrast of isoluminante red and green stimuli was preserved well at high spatial frequencies despite the decreaced contrast sensitivity for brightness, we used green targets as the training stimuli. After the training, search field and pointing range that could be covered by the patient increased in size for both green and white targets, and daily activities improved. Moreover, after the training, he no longer showed discrepancy in line cancellation performances between ordinary and brighter lighting conditions. In the follow up period, the search field and the performance on the line cancellation test were maintained, while the performance of pointing targets array declined. The family members complained of mild re-deterioration of daily activities. Then, the training for searching and pointing re-introduced at home. After the training, his pointing performance and daily activities, evaluated by questionnaires to his family members, improved again.

A patient with complete cerebral achromatopsia was tested to establish the nature of his residual vision and to determine the integrity of striate cortex function. Behavioural contrast sensitivity, using the method of adjustment, and averaged visually evoked cortical potentials were measured to sinusoidally modulated chromatic and achromatic gratings in an achromatopsic patient and a normal observer. Eye movements were measured in the patient using a Skalar infrared monitoring system. The patient's chromatic contrast sensitivity was normal, indicating that despite his dense colour blindness his occipital cortex still processed information about spatial variations in hue. His sensitivity to achromatic gratings was depressed particularly at high spatial frequencies, possibly because of his jerk nystagmus. These behavioural results were reinforced by the nature of visually evoked responses to chromatic and achromatic gratings, in which total colour blindness coexisted with an almost normal cortical potential to isoluminant chromatic gratings. The results show that information about chromatic contrast is present in some cortical areas, and coded in a colour-opponent fashion, in the absence of any perceptual experience of colour.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.60.6.638,PMC1073947,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The hallucinated text conveys little if any meaning, typically consisting of individual letters, words, or nonsense letter strings (orthographic hallucinations). A patient is described with textual visual hallucinations of a very different linguistic content following bilateral occipito-temporal infarcts. The hallucinations consisted of grammatically correct, meaningful written sentences or phrases, often in the second person and with a threatening and command-like nature (syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations). A detailed phenomenological interview and visual psychophysical testing were undertaken. The patient showed a classical ventral occipito-temporal syndrome with achromatopsia, prosopagnosia, and associative visual agnosia. Of particular significance was the presence of pure alexia. Illusions of colour induced by monochromatic gratings and a novel motion-direction illusion were also observed, both consistent with the residual capacities of the patient's spared visual cortex. The content of orthographic visual hallucinations matches the known specialisations of an area in the left posterior fusiform gyrus--the visual word form area (VWFA)--suggesting the two are related. The VWFA is unlikely to be responsible for the syntacto-semantic hallucinations described here as the patient had a pure alexic syndrome, a known consequence of VWFA lesions. Syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations may represent a separate category of textual hallucinations related to the cortical network implicated in the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",,PMC1757477,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
