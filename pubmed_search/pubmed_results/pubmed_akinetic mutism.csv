19297375,Akinetic mutism--not coma.,"Shetty, Anita Chittaranjan; Morris, John; O'Mahony, Paul",Shetty,"We describe a case of akinetic mutism mistaken as coma. A 77-year old lady presented with apparent unresponsiveness. In fact she responded when stimulated. She subsequently developed movements typical of clonic perseveration, erroneously treated as seizures. She also had features of a frontal lobe syndrome. Initial CT scan showed no abnormality; it was only after an MRI scan that a diagnosis of bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction was made. MRI scanning should be considered early in the investigation of patients with atypical neurological presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Age and ageing,10.1093/ageing/afp005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
37781407,Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy after viral encephalitis: a case report of bimodal overlapping encephalitis.,"Cheng, Ping; Huang, Wenjuan; Yang, Meifang; Chen, Zhiren; Geng, Yifan; Zhang, Xia; Chen, Weiwei",Cheng,"Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a treatable autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system. Despite extensive research, the exact etiology and pathogenesis of this condition remain unclear. In recent years, autoimmune encephalitis (AE) after viral encephalitis (VE) has gathered significant attention. Here, we present a case report of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy after VE in a 43-year-old Asian male with a history of oral and labial herpes. The patient presented with high-grade fever, headache, urinary retention, unresponsiveness, and apathy. Elevated levels of protein and GFAP-IgG were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed linear enhancement oriented radially to the ventricles. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resulted in symptom relief, reduced lesion enhancement, and decreased protein levels. This case report highlights bimodal encephalitis with no discernible interval between VE and autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy, which poses diagnostic challenges. Notably, autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is a novel form of autoimmune encephalitis, and its treatment lacks sufficient clinical experience. Intriguingly, our patient demonstrated sensitivity to IVIG, a treatment that differed from past reports. Therefore, further exploration of treatment strategies for this condition is warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1258048,PMC10535097,case report; encephalitis; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); herpes simplex viral encephalitis (HSVE); viral encephalitis (VE),"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

David sustained a stroke following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombus. A CT scan at the time detected old ischaemic infarcts affecting the right frontal lobe, the left occipital lobe and the left parietal lobe so David had bilateral brain damage. Initially thought to have a DOC, further neuropsychological assessments administered when David had improved a little, resulted in the diagnosis of AM. Although David spoke little, when he did speak, his words and phrases were well articulated, grammatical and with appropriate intonation. He was alert and visually aware and he was not paralysed. We discuss whether the diagnosis was correct and address the difficulties in assessing such patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2017.1281147,,Akinetic mutism; differential diagnosis; neuropsychological assessments,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 56-year-old male with a closed head injury was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) with GCS=4 (V1, M2, E1). Computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed a limited subarachnoid haemorrhage in the sylvian region without any brain oedema or ventricular shift. The GCS did not change until day 6. At the same time EEG showed a reactivity to acoustic stimuli consisting in the paradoxical appearance of a posterior rhythm in alpha range (10-12c/s), blocked by passive eye opening. Early cortical components (N20-P25) of somatosensory evoked potentials were normal on both hemispheres; middle components were also clearly evident. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed both diffuse and midbrain axonal injuries, particularly in a strategic lesion involving both cerebral peduncles. Event related potentials showed N2 and P3 components to stimulation by rare tones. A comprehensive multimodal neurophysiological approach, using the more informative tests and the proper time of recording, should be included in protocols for patients with severe head trauma, in order to establish the actual patient's clinical state and to avoid that a locked-in syndrome state be mistaken for prolonged coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state or akinetic mutism. Neurophysiological evaluation before discharge from ICU can be a baseline evaluation useful for the follow-up of low-responsive patients in the neuro-rehabilitation unit.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology,10.1016/j.neucli.2008.11.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,France,eng

The authors report a 41-year-old man who was diagnosed with delayed spongiform leukoencephalopathy three weeks after injecting heroin intravenously. He had been admitted to another hospital due to acute heroin overdose, which had occurred four hours after intravenous injection of an unknown amount of heroin. His clinical condition showed progressive improvement and he was discharged 12 days after admission. Three weeks after this episode, his cognitive functioning declined. Akinetic mutism, spasticity and hyperreflexia of all extremities were observed. Electroencephalography (EEG) and imaging of the brain showed typical characteristics of spongiform leukoencephalopathy.

A Japanese woman complained of visual disorder at the age of 86 years and then showed disorientation and memory disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cerebral cortical hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images. The patient died 2 months after the onset of symptoms; her condition did not reach the akinetic mutism state and periodic sharp-wave complexes on electroencephalography and myoclonus were not recognized. The brain weighed 1100 g and neuropathological examination showed extensive fine vacuole-type spongiform changes in the cerebral cortex. In some cortical regions, large confluent vacuole-type spongiform changes were also present. Gliosis and hypertrophic astrocytosis were generally mild, and tissue rarefaction of the neuropil and neuronal loss were not apparent. PrP immunostaining showed diffuse synaptic-type PrP deposition in the cerebral gray matter, but some regions with large confluent vacuoles showed perivacuolar-type deposition.

25262046,Catatonia after cerebral hypoxia: do the usual treatments apply?,"Quinn, Davin K; Abbott, Christopher C",Quinn,"Neurologic deterioration occurring days to weeks after a cerebral hypoxic event accompanied by diffuse white matter demyelination is called delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL). Manifestations of DPHL are diverse and include dementia, gait disturbance, incontinence, pyramidal tract signs, parkinsonism, chorea, mood and thought disorders, akinetic mutism, and rarely catatonia. We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL. The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL. No treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psychotropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT. There are 7 case reports of neurologic decompensation during ECT treatment after a cerebral hypoxic event. Caution is advised when considering ECT for catatonia when delayed sequelae of cerebral hypoxia are on the differential diagnosis, as there is a dearth of evidence to support this treatment approach.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Psychosomatics,10.1016/j.psym.2014.03.010,PMC4182149,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

35004070,Delayed Toxic-Hypoxic Leukoencephalopathy As Sequela of Opioid Overdose and Cerebral Hypoxia-Ischemia.,"Chachkhiani, David; Chimakurthy, Anil K; Verdecie, Olinda; Goyne, Cheryl T; Mader, Edward C",Chachkhiani,"Delayed leukoencephalopathy in the aftermath of toxic exposure and cerebral hypoxia-ischemia is known as ""delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy"" (DPHL) but the name ""delayed toxic-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy"" (DTHL) may be more accurate if toxic and hypoxic mechanisms are both involved in the pathogenesis of delayed leukoencephalopathy. DTHL is characterized by initial recovery from toxic exposure and cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, clinical stability over a few weeks, and subsequent neurological deterioration with the sudden emergence of diffuse white matter disease. A 46-year-old man suffered respiratory failure and hypotension as a result of opioid overdose. Brain MRI showed watershed infarcts and EEG showed diffuse theta-delta slowing consistent with global cerebral hypoperfusion. He recovered fully and was discharged with intact cognitive function. Three weeks later, he presented with abulia and psychomotor retardation. MRI revealed extensive white matter hyperintensity and EEG showed diffuse polymorphic delta activity. DTHL was diagnosed based on classic MRI features, history of opioid overdose and hypoxic brain injury, and negative test results for etiology of white matter disease. He developed akinetic mutism prompting administration of methylprednisolone 1000-mg IV q24h for five days. He also received amantadine 100-mg PO q12h. His cognition, motivation, and psychomotor function slowly improved and returned to baseline about two months after the overdose. Clinic reassessment two and a half months after the overdose revealed normal cognitive function, slight residual MRI hyperintensity, and mild EEG slowing anteriorly.

One and a half years later, the patient was wheelchair-bound and severely demented. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed left dominant atrophy of the frontoparietal lobe. There was a hyperintense lesion in the deep white matter expanding toward the subcortical area on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In order to rule out the possibility of an intracranial tumor such as an astrocytoma or malignant lymphoma, we performed a brain biopsy of the left frontal middle gyrus. The patient became bedridden and showed akinetic mutism 1 year after biopsy. Pathological examination revealed a large amount of 4-repeat tau-immunoreactive neuropil threads scattered predominantly in the corticomedullary junction and tau-immunoreactive structures, consistent with CBD. Immunostaining for p53 showed no positive cells, and there were very few Ki-67-positive cells. On immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts, a major doublet of 64 and 68 kDa full-length tau with two closely related fragments of approximately 37 kDa were detected. Based on these results, the patient was pathologically diagnosed as having CBD, excluding the possibility of tumor. Taken together with previous similar case reports, our findings indicate that a deep white matter hyperintense lesion on FLAIR images may be a useful clue to CBD, predicting rapid clinical progression with severe dementia based on severe white matter degeneration with a large amount of tau accumulation on pathological examination.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12638,,dementia; frontotemporal dementia; neuropil threads; tau proteins; white matter,Case Reports,Australia,eng

21855865,Posterior fossa syndrome in adults: a new case and comprehensive survey of the literature.,"Mariën, Peter; De Smet, Hyo Jung; Wijgerde, Ellen; Verhoeven, Jo; Crols, Roel; De Deyn, Peter P",Mariën,"Although the posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) can be considered as an aetiologically heterogeneous condition affecting children and adults, it most often occurs in paediatric patients after cerebellar tumour surgery. In patients with a tumoural aetiology, the syndrome is typically characterised by a short symptom-free postoperative period followed by mutism of variable duration and behavioural and affective changes. More than 200 paediatric cases have been described but reports of adult patients are extremely rare. This paper discusses PFS in adults on the basis of a comprehensive literature survey and describes the pre- and postoperative findings in a new adult patient. In the preoperative phase, cognitive, behavioural and affective abnormalities were identified, matching a diagnosis of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998; Schmahmann, 2004). The immediate postoperative course was characterised by prefrontal-like behavioural and affective abnormalities, peduncular hallucinations and confusion evolving to psychosis. Akinetic mutism subsequently developed, lasted for 12 days and then alternated with episodes of diminished responsiveness in which pathological laughing and crying (PLC) occurred. Akinetic mutism resolved after treatment with a non-ergoline dopamine-agonist but CCAS persisted during longitudinal follow-up. From a semiological point of view ""relapsing-remitting akinetic mutism"" and PLC in our patient might add relevant information to current insights in the clinical expression of the PFS. As evidenced by a close parallelism between single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and clinical findings, CCAS as well as PFS seem to reflect functional disruption of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in cognitive, behavioural and affective functions. These findings may indicate that both syndromes share overt semiological resemblances and a common pathophysiological substrate.

Although anaphylactic shock has been reported, no related incidents have been documented on cerebral angiography. This article reports a serious case of anaphylactic shock possibly induced by iodixanol and provides an overview of the case report. A 65-year-old female with persistent headaches for nearly six months and CTA examination revealed multiple intracranial aneurysms. After two treatments, she returned to the hospital for aneurysm of reexamination a month ago. Following a preoperative assessment, cerebral angiography was performed. Three minutes after the procedure, the patient experienced dizziness, increased heart rate, followed by hypotension (BP 90/43 mm Hg), a sudden drop-in heart rate (HR 68 bpm), and a drop in SpO2 to 92%. Intravenous dexamethasone for anti-allergic were administered immediately, along with therapy through oxygen-inhalation.

However no direct neuropsychological evidence supports this hypothesis and studies including patients with restricted lesions of this brain region are almost non-existent. Using direct intraoperative electrostimulations, we showed in a rare patient that disrupting the subcortical connectivity of the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) reliably induced a breakdown in conscious experience. This acute phenomenon was mainly characterized by a transient behavioral unresponsiveness with loss of external connectedness. In all cases, when he regained consciousness, the patient described himself as in dream, outside the operating room. This finding suggests that functional integrity of the PPC connectivity is necessary for maintaining consciousness of external environment.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.01.020,,Consciousness disorders; Electrical stimulations; External awareness; Posterior cingulate; Precuneus,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A 69-year-old female patient was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage produced by the subarachnoid hemorrhage. She exhibited impaired consciousness with a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score of 13 until 1 month after onset. Her impaired consciousness recovered slowly to a normal state according to the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (23 points: full score) at 7 weeks after onset. On the other hand, she exhibited the typical clinical features of akinetic mutism (no spontaneous movement [akinesia] or speech [mutism]). On the DTT performed at 1-month, the upper, and lower dorsal ascending reticular activating systems, which are related to a disorder of consciousness, showed an almost normal state. In contrast, the prefronto-caudate and prefronto-thalamic tracts, which are related to akinetic mutism, showed severe injuries. These DTT results suggested that the patient's main clinical features were not a disorder of consciousness but akinetic mutism. Therefore, DTT for the ascending reticular activating system, and the prefronto-caudate and prefronto-thalamic tracts could provide additional evidence for a differential diagnosis of DOC and AM at the early stages of stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in human neuroscience,10.3389/fnhum.2022.778347,PMC8914078,akinetic mutism; diffusion tensor tractography (DTT); disorder of consciousness (DOC); prefronto-caudate tract; prefronto-thalamic tract,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

38111454,Miller-Fisher Syndrome Unveiled in the Presence of Cholangiocarcinoma.,"Hakobyan, Narek; Yadav, Ruchi; Pokhrel, Akriti; Wasifuddin, Mustafa; John, Michaela J; Yadav, Siddharth; Boris, Avezbakiyev",Hakobyan,"Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, characterized by ataxia, areflexia, ophthalmoplegia, and possible facial, swallowing and limb weakness alongside respiratory failure. Variations within MFS may include respiratory and limb weakness and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE), marked by altered consciousness, ataxia, ophthalmoparesis, and paradoxical hyperreflexia. MFS can emerge in both children and adults, often following bacterial or viral illness. While autoimmune-driven nerve damage occurs, most MFS patients recover within six months without specific treatment, with a low risk of lasting neurological deficits or relapses. Rarely fatal, MFS's co-occurrence with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) presents unique management challenges. CCA, primarily affecting bile ducts, has a bleak prognosis; surgical resection offers limited cure potential due to late-stage detection and high recurrence rates. Advances in CCA's molecular understanding have led to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, requiring a comprehensive interdisciplinary care approach for optimal MFS and CCA management outcomes. Herein, we present a 50-year-old male with a complex medical history who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and ascites. Imaging revealed pneumonia and secondary bacterial peritonitis. Later, he developed neurological symptoms, including weakness, gait abnormalities, and brainstem symptoms, leading to the diagnosis of MFS. Despite treatment efforts, his condition deteriorated, leading to acute liver failure and unexplained anasarca. N-acetyl cysteine was initiated for liver issues. Neurologically, he showed quadriparesis and areflexia. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment improved his neurological symptoms but worsened gastrointestinal issues, including ileus and elevated CA19-9 levels, suggesting a potential carcinoma. A liver biopsy was performed. After IVIG treatment, he experienced widespread discomfort, emotional unresponsiveness, swallowing difficulties, and aspiration risk, ultimately leading to his demise.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.49016,PMC10727167,bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis; distal cholangiocarcinoma; guillain-barré syndreome; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; miller-fisher syndrome,Case Reports,United States,eng

Research in animals after stroke has shown that aerobic exercise combined with forelimb motor training improved forelimb motor function more than aerobic exercise or motor training alone. There is a lack of knowledge about this combined intervention in humans after stroke. These 2 case reports describe the exploratory implementation of a combined aerobic exercise and task-specific training intervention to improve upper limb motor function in one person in subacute stroke recovery and one person in chronic stroke recovery. Case descriptions Subacute participant: 45-year-old female, 3 months after ischemic stroke resulting in left-sided hemiparesis affecting her non-dominant upper limb, with a baseline Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score of 10/57 and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) score of 39/75. Chronic participant: 69-year-old female, 14 years after ischemic stroke resulting in right-sided hemiparesis affecting her non-dominant upper limb, with a baseline ARAT score of 13/57 and WMFT score of 34/75. Intervention Participants performed 30 min of lower limb cycling immediately prior to 30 min of upper limb task-specific training. Sessions were undertaken 3 times a week for 8 weeks in a university rehabilitation laboratory. Results The combined intervention was feasible and perceived as acceptable and beneficial. Participants improved their upper limb motor function on the ARAT (subacute participant = 4 points; chronic participant = 2 points) and WMFT (subacute participant = 5 points; chronic participant = 3 points). Participants improved their aerobic fitness (subacute participant = +4.66 ml O<sub>2</sub> /kg/min; chronic participant = +7.34 ml O<sub>2</sub> /kg/min) and 6-minute walking distance (subacute participant = +50 m; chronic participant = +37 m). Discussion Combining aerobic exercise with task-specific training may be a worthwhile therapeutic approach to improve upper limb motor function suitable for persons in the subacute or chronic phase after stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy,10.1002/pri.1707,,exercise; motor learning/control; neuroplasticity; rehabilitation; stroke,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

To the best of our knowledge, PFS due to cerebellar stroke has only been reported in patients who also underwent surgical treatment of the underlying vascular cause. We report longitudinal clinical, neurocognitive and neuroradiological findings in a 71-year-old right-handed patient who developed PFS following a right cerebellar haemorrhage that was not surgically evacuated. During follow-up, functional neuroimaging was conducted by means of quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT studies. After a 10-day period of akinetic mutism, the clinical picture developed into cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) with reversion to a previously learnt accent, consistent with neurogenic foreign accent syndrome (FAS). No psychometric evidence for dementia was found. Quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT studies consistently disclosed perfusional deficits in the anatomoclinically suspected but structurally intact bilateral prefrontal brain regions. Since no surgical treatment of the cerebellar haematoma was performed, this case report is presumably the first description of pure, ""non-surgical vascular PFS"". In addition, reversion to a previously learnt accent which represents a subtype of FAS has never been reported after cerebellar damage. The combination of this unique constellation of poststroke neurobehavioural changes reflected on SPECT shows that the cerebellum is crucially implicated in the modulation of neurocognitive and affective processes. A decrease of excitatory impulses from the lesioned cerebellum to the structurally intact supratentorial network subserving cognitive, behavioural and affective processes constitutes the likely pathophysiological mechanism underlying PFS and CCAS in this patient.",{},,"Cerebellum (London, England)",10.1007/s12311-013-0478-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Peri-neural spread is an emerging phenomenon that explains the distant spread of tumour cells well beyond the local extent of invasion. This under recognized route of tumour spread often results in delayed diagnosis and reduced life expectancy. The authors report a case of an isolated third nerve palsy as the only initial manifestation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion. The patient presented with left painful pupil involving complete third nerve palsy. Contrast enhanced imaging was initially deferred due to renal impairment. Plain MRI with MRA brain was normal. Hematology was suggestive of giant cell arteritis which is a rare but well documented cause of painful nerve palsies in the elderly. Unresponsiveness to steroids prompted contrast imaging with a reduced gadolinium dosing and hemodialysis backup which finally revealed a nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This report is the journey of a third nerve palsy from a clinical diagnosis of an aneurysm (pupil involving palsy) to a probable diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (based on hematology) and to a final diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (based on contrast imaging and immunohistochemistry)Nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be successfully cured if detected early.

Initial diagnosis is generally based on clinical and MRI findings, which may be misinterpreted as other neurological pictures, including autoimmune encephalitis (AE). AE is a heterogeneous group of neuroinflammatory diseases due to the presence of auto-antibodies targeting antigens on neuronal synaptic or cell surface. In the present report, we describe two peculiar cases of GBM initially misdiagnosed as AE, focusing on the diagnostic pitfalls and the treatment strategies. We report the case of two patients with high-grade brain tumors, initially misdiagnosed and treated for AE. Clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological data are discussed in terms of differential diagnosis between AE and GBM. The presence of atypical brain MRI findings and the unresponsiveness to immunosuppressive treatment are major red flags in the differential diagnosis between AE and GBM. In these cases, a brain biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Atypical brain tumor presentation causes a diagnostic and therapeutic delay. A positive onconeural autoantibodies result should always be interpreted cautiously, considering the possibility of a false-positive test. A brain biopsy is mandatory for a definite diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in oncology,10.3389/fonc.2023.1254674,PMC10484219,autoimmune encephalitis; diagnosis; epilepsy; glioblastoma; neuroimaging,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A carotid and intracranial duplex ultrasound revealed a reverse flow within the left vertebral artery indicating the presence of subclavian stealing syndrome while extracranial MRA suggested some stenosis at the origin of the left common carotid artery. The EEG was consistent with epilepsy. Neurological manifestations are secondary to ischemia caused by decreased blood flow in the involved carotid and vertebral arteries.

The SPECT scan revealed the causative bifrontal hypoperfusion, more prominent on the right, while the structurally evident cerebellar infarction was predictably masked by subacute hyperperfusion phenomenon. Contralateral frontal diaschisis is an established sequela of cerebellar infarction. Because this patient also had lesions in the left parietal region, her left prefrontal area was critically deprived of its major reciprocally connected cortical counterparts (right prefrontal and left parietal), and also became dysfunctional. Her resulting bilateral frontal dysfunction is a common cause of akinetic mutism.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31829bd4f5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 25-year-old male with a history of a nasal furuncle presents with an acute onset of fixed and dilated pupils, bilateral exophthalmos, hemorrhagic chemosis, elevated intraocular pressures, restricted extraocular motility, and unresponsiveness. A retinal septic emboli in the left eye is present on dilated fundoscopic exam while an exudative retinal detachment is present in the right eye. MRI/MRV revealed extensive thrombosis of cavernous sinuses, distal sigmoid dural sinuses, and proximal internal jugular veins with associated cerebral edema and multifocal areas of venous infarction. Blood cultures grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the patient suffered multi-system organ failure. Despite treatment with full dose systemic anticoagulation and broad spectrum antibiotics the patient suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and expired. The acuity of onset coupled with the multiple risk factors for septic cavernous sinus thrombosis in this patient led to a fulminant presentation of this disease and ultimate poor outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",10.3109/01676830.2013.814686,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Herein, we reported the case of a 61-year-old patient with DE after acute CO poisoning, who displayed heterogeneous patterns of cortical and subcortical structural integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Four distinct patterns of diffusion tensor metrics (fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) were observed in the patient compared to age-matched controls (a decrease in FA and an increase in MD, a decrease in FA only, an increase in MD only, and an increase in FA and MD).

Its use over the last two decades has expanded, ranging from psychiatric disorders to traumatic brain injury and poststroke rehabilitation. We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient who presented in a decreased state of consciousness due to a right frontal glioblastoma, wherein his state was not improved by a successful surgery and could not be explained by any other condition. Due to his poor prognosis, we examine the benefits of receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment to improve his akinetic mutism. We utilized independent component analysis with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to better understand his cortical functionality. The imaging suggested absence of the default mode network (DMN). The patient underwent five sessions of navigated intermittent theta burst stimulation to the ipsilesional inferior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus, with the aim of improving his default mode network functionality. No other treatments resulted in an improvement of this patient's condition; however, 3 weeks following transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, the patient was more alert and interactive, and his follow-up rsfMRI scan demonstrated a partially intact default mode network. This case raises important questions regarding the clinical utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve the connectivity of important cerebral networks and subsequent related functional recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.2180,PMC8413751,default mode network; glioblastoma; right frontal tumor; theta burst stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; tumor resection,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31672142,Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.,"Ishii, Kazuhiro; Yamamoto, Fumiko; Homma, Shinsuke; Okada, Yoshinori; Nakamichi, Kazuo; Saijo, Masayuki; Tamaoka, Akira",Ishii,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities. A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms. When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce inflammation, should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-019-1493-1,PMC6822459,CD4 positive cell; Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; JC polyomavirus; Lung transplantation; Mefloquine; Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

The illness began with neuropsychiatric symptoms and was followed by prolonged unresponsiveness, respiratory failure, and autonomic instability. The movement disorder consisted of semirhythmic repetitive bulbar and limb movements and persisted during prolonged periods of unresponsiveness, diminishing as awareness returned. The characteristics of the movement disorder differed from recognized dyskinesias. It is suggested that interruption of forebrain corticostriatal inputs by anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies removes tonic inhibition of brainstem pattern generators releasing primitive patterns of bulbar and limb movement. Recognition of the distinctive movements should prompt a search for an ovarian teratoma since the condition is responsive to tumor resection and immunomodulation.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.22073,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 61-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with speaking difficulties including repeated usage of the same words. He was hospitalized on the seventh day after symptom onset, and diffusion-weighted images on magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense regions in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus. On the 11th day after symptom onset, head computed tomography revealed ICH in the right occipital and parietal lobes. Routine laboratory evaluations and angiography revealed no cause of ICH. Myoclonus of the extremities and drowsiness were observed on the 15th day after symptom onset. He reached the state of akinetic mutism approximately two months after symptom onset. The cerebrospinal fluid test revealed positive real-time quaking-induced conversion and 14-3-3 protein. Electroencephalography revealed periodic sharp wave complexes. A clinical diagnosis of probable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was made according to the diagnostic criteria. After a relapse of pneumonia, he passed away on the 103rd day after symptom onset. Postmortem examination revealed ICH in the right posterior cingulate gyrus. No pathological change that might have caused ICH was obtained. Although the effect of sCJD on the onset of ICH is undeniable, the cause of ICH was unknown. Prion protein immunohistochemistry revealed the following results: (1) weak synaptic-type deposits in the tissue rarefacted by ICH; (2) synaptic-type deposits in the cerebral cortex, which showed fine vacuoles; and (3) perivacuolar-type deposits in the inferior temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus, which showed frequent large confluent vacuoles. Although it could be considered MM1-type sCJD clinically, this case was neuropathologically diagnosed as having MM1 + 2C-type sCJD. It was shown that ICH may occur in early-phase sCJD. To improve sCJD prognosis, treatment of complications and careful follow up are important. Furthermore, pathological diagnosis is indispensable for sCJD type diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12658,,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; fine vacuole; intracerebral hemorrhage; large confluent vacuole; synaptic type,Case Reports,Australia,eng

39039495,CHANTER syndrome in the context of pain medication: a case report.,"Jansen, Nils; Wulff, Leonard; Conty, Moritz; Schäbitz, Wolf-Rüdiger; Klingebiel, Randolf",Jansen,"CHANTER (Cerebellar Hippocampal and Basal Nuclei Transient Edema with Restricted diffusion) is a recently described syndrome occurring in the context of drug abuse. While clinical findings are rather unspecific (disorientation, unresponsiveness), MR imaging (MRI) discloses a characteristic pattern (restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia and hippocampi, cerebellar oedema and haemorrhage), allowing for timely diagnosis before complications such as cerebellar swelling and herniation do occur. Here we report a case of CHANTER primarily based on imaging findings, as there was no evidence of drug abuse on admission. A 62-year-old Patient was admitted to our hospital after being unresponsive at home. Prehospital intubation was performed, which limited neurological assessment. Under these circumstances no obvious symptoms could be determined, i.e. pupils were isocoric and responsive, and there were no signs of seizures. While the initial CT scan was unremarkable, the subsequent MRI scan showed a distinct imaging pattern: moderately enhancing areas in the basal ganglia and hippocampi with diffusion restriction, accompanied by cerebellar haemorrhage and oedema (Figs. 1 and 2). A comprehensive clinical and laboratory work-up was performed, including drug screening, spinal tap, Holter ECG, echocardiography and EEG. The only conspicuous anamnestic finding was a chronic pain syndrome whose medication had been supplemented with opioids two months previously. The opioid medication was discontinued, which led to a rapid improvement in the patient's clinical condition without any further measures. The patient was able to leave the intensive care unit and was discharged 10 days after admission without persistent neurological deficits. Familiarity with typical MRI patterns of toxic encephalopathy in patients from high-risk groups, such as drug abusers, is crucial in emergency neuroradiology. In the presence of typical MRI findings, CHANTER syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis, even if there is no history of drug abuse, to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-024-03748-3,PMC11265104,CHANTER syndrome; MRI; Opioids; POUNCE syndrome; Pain,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report on a patient with AM associated with injury of the prefronto-caudate tract and prefronto-thalamic tract following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). A 20-year-old man suffered from TBI resulting from a pedestrian car accident. Following the TBI, he developed abulia (decreased activity and speech) that worsened over approximately a year. His typical features of AM that remained stable from one year until two years after the TBI are: he showed no spontaneous movement or speech and remained recumbent with no spontaneous activity. On one-month DTT, the neural connectivity of the caudate nucleus to the medial prefrontal cortex was low in both hemispheres, and this neural connectivity was lower on two-year DTT. The orbitofrontal-thalamic tract was thin in the left hemisphere on one-month DTT, whereas this tract became thinner in both hemispheres on two-year DTT. Using serial DTTs, injuries of the prefronto-caudate tract and orbitofrontal-thalamic tract and degeneration of these injured neural tracts concurrent with aggravation of abulia to AM were demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI.

Here, we report four cases of CJD with different clinical presentations diagnosed at our institution over a 2-year period. The first patient is an 82-year-old woman who presented with depression, cognitive decline, and word-finding difficulty over 4 weeks. The patient deteriorated neurologically to akinetic mutism and death within 6 weeks of presentation. The second patient is a 54-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis who presented with confusion, ataxia, and multiple falls over 4 weeks. She was treated initially for hepatic encephalopathy but continued to progress to mutism, startle myoclonus, and obtundation. Death occurred within 4 weeks of presentation.

Death occurred within 3 weeks from presentation. These four cases highlight the varied possible clinical presentations of CJD and demonstrate the importance of considering CJD in patients with atypical presentations of rapidly progressive cognitive decline. To diagnose CJD, brain biopsy remains the gold standard. However, the presence of CSF protein 14-3-3, typical MRI findings and suggestive EEG abnormalities, all support the diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2016.00138,PMC5002415,Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; dementia; neuropathology; prion protein; spongiform encephalopathy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

There have been reports of poststroke patients with abulia being treated by modulating this dopamine circuitry and in some cases with short-term low-dose olanzapine.

There are two types of paroxysmal positional vertigo. One is what DIX and HALLPIKE (1952) call the benign type which is thought to be caused by otolith lesions. Another is a malignant type, in contrast to the former and is related to a lesion in the central nervous system. Otologists are usually familiar with the former, but the latter is not known among neurologists and neurosurgeons. We experienced 37 cases of the malignant type and found that this type of paroxysmal vertigo is induced by various diseases. Furthermore, we believe that the mechanism of this paroxysmal vertigo is the lack of inhibitory function of the vestibular cerebellum, and not abrupt malfunction of communication of the cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricular system.

This syndrome is characterized by progressive motor symptoms and dysautonomia that develop over weeks to months. We present three cases of abrupt-onset inhaled heroin-associated toxic leukoencephalopathy, a previously undescribed entity. These likely represent a subset of ""found down"" patients with acute neurologic changes not attributable to hypoxemic encephalopathy. All three had magnetic resonance imaging findings characteristic of toxic leukoencephalopathy, which has a relatively favorable prognosis. Prolonged unresponsiveness in patients ""found down"" after heroin overdose is often attributed to hypoxic brain injury. Brain magnetic resonance imaging is not generally included as part of routine workup. It should, however, be considered in patients with suspected inhaled heroin use due to the relatively favorable prognosis of toxic leukoencephalopathy. This is especially relevant in the setting of the current opioid epidemic and related increase in overdose-related intensive care unit admissions. The result may have significant impact on decisions about therapeutic options or continuation of care.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of the Intensive Care Society,10.1177/1751143718774714,PMC6376586,Heroin; heroin spongiform leukoencephalopathy; toxic leukoencephalopathy; “chasing the dragon; ” magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports,England,eng

Its therapeutic evidence relies on single case reports that used atomoxetine or levodopa with variable latency and efficacy. We present the case of a 54-year-old woman who developed akinetic mutism after infarction in the territory of the right anterior cerebral artery, successfully treated with methylphenidate and levodopa/benserazide. Clinical examination showed a patient lacking any spontaneous speech and movement while opening her eyes and fixating. Suspecting akinetic mutism after a comprehensive diagnostic work-up, we started an individual therapy attempt with methylphenidate 10 mg and levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg twice daily. Both drugs affect the dopaminergic and noradrenergic transmission in the frontal-subcortical circuit, compromised in akinetic mutism. We saw rapid and sustained improvement in her volitional actions, devoid of side effects. Finally, the patient was actively communicating and moving her limbs. We discuss the patient's favorable clinical course in response to the synergistic combination of methylphenidate and levodopa/benserazide, emerging as a promising treatment strategy, and provide a brief literature review of treatment options in akinetic mutism following stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000539033,PMC11250274,Akinetic mutism; Case report; Methylphenidate; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

31147176,Why do neurologists miss catatonia in neurology emergency? A case series and brief literature review.,"Anand, Sucharita; Kumar Paliwal, Vimal; Singh, Laxmi S; Uniyal, Ravi",Anand,"Catatonia is a well-described clinical syndrome characterized by features that range from mutism, negativism and stupor to agitation, mannerisms and stereotype. Causes of catatonia may range from organic brain disorders to psychiatric conditions. Despite a characteristic syndrome, catatonia is grossly under diagnosed. The reason for missed diagnosis of catatonia in neurology setting is not clear. Poor awareness is an unlikely cause because catatonia is taught among conditions with deregulated consciousness like vegetative state, locked-in state and akinetic mutism. We determined the proportion of catatonia patients correctly identified by neurology residents in neurology emergency. We also looked at the alternate diagnosis they received to identify catatonia mimics. Twelve patients (age 22-55 years, 7 females) of catatonia were discharged from a single unit of neurology department from 2007 to 2017. In the emergency department, neurology residents diagnosed none of the patients as catatonia. They offered diagnosis of extrapyramidal syndrome in 7, meningitis in 2, and conversion reaction, acute psychosis/encephalopathy and non-convulsive status epilepticus in one each. Their final diagnosis at discharge was catatonia due to general medical condition in 6 (progressive supranuclear palsy in 2, post-status epilepticus, uremic encephalopathy, glioblastoma multiforme and tuberculous meningitis in one each), catatonia due to major depression in 4, schizophrenia and idiopathic catatonia in one each. Extrapyramidal syndrome appeared as common mimic of catatonia. The literature reviewed also revealed the majority of organic catatonia secondary to causes that are usually associated with extrapyramidal features. Therefore, we suggest that neurologists should consider catatonia in patients presenting with extrapyramidal syndromes.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2019.105375,,Catatonia; Extrapyramidal disorder; Major depression; Parkinsonism; Schizophrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng

Specifically, we studied activations to sound embedded in a block design using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after application of anodal tDCS to the right auditory cortex. Before tDCS, auditory discrimination deficits were associated with abnormally reduced activations of the auditory cortex and bilateral unresponsiveness of the anterior superior temporal sulci and gyri. This session replicated a previous functional scan with the same paradigm a year before the current experiment. We then applied anodal tDCS over right auditory cortex for 20 min-utes and immediately re-scanned the patient. We found increased activation of bilateral auditory cortices and, for speech sounds, selectively increased activation in Broca's and Wernicke's areas.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,General hospital psychiatry,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.05.008,PMC7242189,Akinetic mutism; COVID-19; Delirium; Encephalopathy; SARS-CoV-2,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years.

Still, its presentation due to the ruptured aneurysm is rare and its presentation with akinetic mutism has not been reported. The patient in the present study is 21-year-old female who presented in our emergency department in an altered sensorium with Glasgow comma score (GCS) E2V1M1. She was intubated and resuscitated. Routine blood investigations, lipid profile, and hormonal studies were normal. Initial noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the interhemispheric fissure and evidence of bleeding in the pituitary gland. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was soon done, which showed an infarct and hemorrhage in the pituitary gland; there was an evidence of an infarct in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, and supplementary motor area. MR arteriography revealed an aneurysm at the left A1-anterior communicating artery (Acom) junction directed superomedially with diffuse spasm in a bilateral anterior cerebral artery. Pterional craniotomy was done with clipping of the aneurysm and evacuation of blood clots from the interhemispheric fissure and pituitary gland.

There were no signs of lesions of the pyramidal tracts or of other motor structures. The most obvious deficits were an abnormal gait with an exaggerated knee extension and a tendency to fall slowly, especially when pushed backward. In contrast, Romberg's test on an unstable platform was normal, as were long-latency leg reflexes induced by perturbations. Inadequate anticipatory and compensatory postural responses, in particular across the hip and knee joints, and slow movements seemed responsible for the falls. Muscle tone was normal but reflex studies showed signs of abnormal facilitation and inhibition at various levels of the neuraxis. We conclude that the GP and SN lesions caused defective input to premotor cortical and brain stem target zones. Dysfunctioning of these zones leads to improper control of the descending ventromedial motor system responsible for locomotion, postural control, and reflex status. The deficits in upper extremity motor performance included delayed and slow movements, inaccurate amplitudes of ballistic responses, a lack of predictive control, and deficits in bimanual coordination. Sensory feedback, proprioceptive more than visual, played a powerful compensating role in rapid aiming movements. Regional blood flow (studied using 15(O)2) was reduced in multiple frontal cortical regions, among which are the hand areas of the supplementary and premotor cortex.

To study five patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with different behavioural features, we employed [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), MRI and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. Each patient's brain expressed a unique metabolic pattern. In three of the five patients, co-registered PET/MRI correlate islands of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behaviour. Two patients had suffered anoxic injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30-40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with relatively higher metabolic rates, that ranged up to 50-80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained <50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the cortical level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioural patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioural fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical- pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients do not appear to represent random survivals of a few neuronal islands; rather they reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awf131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

MRI findings are included in diagnostic criteria for probable CJD, giving a sensitivity and specificity more than 90%, but the atypical radiological presentations in the early stage of the disease could cause the diagnostic difficulties. CJD can be definitively diagnosed by histopathological confirmation, brain biopsy or at autopsy. We present a case of 53-year-old woman with a history of a rapidly progressive dementia with symptoms of visual impairment, increased extrapyramidal type muscle tonus, stereotypical movements and ataxic gait resulting in the patient's death after13 months. The clinical symptoms deteriorated progressively to myoclonus and akinetic mutism already on the 14th week. The series of diagnostic examinations were done to exclude the possible causes of dementia. Initial MRI evaluation as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on the 9th week after the onset of symptoms created us a diagnostic conundrum. Subsequent MRI findings of symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia (nucleus caudatus, putamen) on the 13th week and EEG with periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) in frontal regions on the 18th week allowed us to diagnose the probable sCJD. The histopathological findings after brain biopsy on the 14th week demonstrated the presence of the abnormal prion protein deposits in the grey matter by immunohistochemistry with ICSM35, KG9 and 12 F10 antibodies and confirmed the diagnosis of sCJD. In this article we focus our attention on a rare association between radiological PRES syndrome and early clinical stage of sCJD. Although concurrent manifestation of these conditions can be accidental, but the immunogenic or neuropeptide mechanisms could explain such radiological MRI findings. A thorough knowledge of differential diagnostic of PRES may be especially useful in earlier diagnosis of sCJD.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-016-0751-8,PMC5120446,Biopsy; Case report; Magnetic resonance imaging; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and a CT scan of the cervical spine in the ED showed no acute findings. Due to hypoxia, the patient was eventually intubated. The patient also required a fasciotomy and eventually hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy due to the left lower extremity wound. He was transferred to our facility for further care. Due to incomplete cognitive recovery, as the patient was oriented to self only, further neurological workup, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, was obtained, which showed bilateral symmetric T2 FLAIR (Fluid attenuated inversion recovery) hyperintensity in the globus pallidus. The patient had slow and gradual deterioration with worsening encephalopathy, akinetic mutism, parkinsonian features, and seizures, which prompted further evaluation from neurology. The patient eventually underwent extensive workup, including a continuous video electroencephalogram (cvEEG), repeat MRI brain with and without contrast, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, MRI brain with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

Atraumatic SDH may be due to vascular disorders, coagulopathies, or intracranial hypotension. It is a rare complication of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with no prior reports in patients with intracranial metastatic colon cancer (MCC). Rapid resolution of the initial acute SDH with contralateral recurrence has not yet been reported in the literature. We present a case of rapidly resolving and recurrent, contralateral acute SDH from DIC secondary to MCC. A 77-year-old woman with MCC presented with severe, acute onset headache. She progressed to unresponsiveness, dilated right pupil, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4T. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head demonstrated a right, 17-mm SDH with a right-to-left midline shift. Repeat CT head 8 hours later revealed resolution of the right SDH. She was extubated with notable clinical improvement. Laboratory examination showed international normalized ratio of 3.4, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The next morning, she became lethargic, GCS score of 3, with bilateral fixed pupils and dilated to 5-mm, and she was then reintubated. Repeat CT head demonstrated a new left SDH with bilateral uncal herniation. A small hyperdense focus in the left parietal region was suspicious for intraparenchymal hematoma versus a hemorrhagic metastatic focus. Shortly after, she was extubated due to do not resuscitate status, and she then passed away. To our knowledge, this is the first case illustrating rapidly resolving and recurrent, contralateral acute SDH from DIC in a patient with MCC. Clinical recognition of this phenotypic pattern should raise the question of an underlying coagulopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104872,,Atraumatic; Contralateral; Disseminated intravascular coagulation; Malignancy; Rapidly resolving; Recurrent; Spontaneous; Subdural hematoma,Case Reports,United States,eng

The perineural spread of the trigeminal nerve is one of the most common and important routes in the intracranial paracavernous extension of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but visual loss is very rare. We report the case of a 54-year-old Japanese man with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, who presented with rapid and severe disturbance of left monocular visual acuity and eye movement with a 10-month history of ipsilateral otitis media and facial pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion in the left fossa of Rosenmüller, pterygopalatine fossa, sphenoid and ethmoid sinus, and the left cavernous sinus extending to the orbital apex through the superior orbital fissure. The histopathological diagnosis was nonkeratinizing undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Epstein-Barr virus was detected by in situ hybridization. Although focal radiotherapy induced remarkable tumor shrinkage and relieved ocular motor disturbance and facial pain, his visual acuity did not improve. The awareness of cranial nerves in addition to intracranial and orbital apex involvement, as in this case, is important for appropriate diagnosis and treatment planning of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/1752-1947-8-361,PMC4227451,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We are reporting a case of a 68-year-old female who presented with unresponsiveness for the second time in six months. She underwent extensive evaluation for liver disease with ultrasonography and computerized tomography of the abdomen, testing for causes of liver disease including testing for viral hepatitis was negative. A liver biopsy was done clearing any doubt about the presence of significant liver disease or clinically significant portal hypertension. With absence of liver disease hence lower likelihood of portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) we evaluated for other causes of encephalopathy with unremarkable neuroimaging including brain MRI and head CT, unremarkable CSF analysis and EEG showing no seizure activity. Given the negative workup and the high ammonia level with the significant clinical response to ammonia lowering therapy we further evaluated the patient for other causes of PSE with Doppler ultrasonography of the liver and eventually angiography of the portal system with the high suspicion for a portosystemic shunt as a cause of her encephalopathy. A shunt from the inferior mesenteric vein to the left renal vein was diagnosed and successfully occluded utilizing coil embolization. The patient recovered normal mentation and was eventually discharged home. This case sheds light on the importance of diagnosing portosystemic shunts leading to encephalopathy, as occlusion of the shunt can correct the encephalopathy and help prevent further episodes.",{},,South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

There is no generally accepted treatment, and it is not known if late treatments are effective. The relationship between AKM and abulia is uncertain. The effects of dopaminergic treatment of a patient with chronic AKM after discrete bilateral infarctions of the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area and the lateral hypothalamus were studied with motor measures, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and neuropsychological tests. Treatment with a combination of carbidopa/levodopa and pergolide produced prompt amelioration of AKM with dramatic and rapid improvement in FIM. An apathetic, amotivational state persisted despite resolution of akinesia and normal frontal executive functions. AKM may respond to dopaminergic treatment even after months of severe akinesia. The mechanism of abulia is more complex than simply a partial dopaminergic deficiency state and may persist even when AKM is treated and frontal cognitive functions are normal.",{},,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,10.1177/154596830101500208,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Some postoperative consequences are difficult to predict due to their low incidence. However, it is essential to recognize reversible symptoms. Akinetic mutism is a devastating but reversible symptom that occurs after supplementary motor area (SMA) injury. This report aims to provide more information to support the clinical progression of this syndrome. A 47-year-old woman presented with psychomotor retardation and subtle weakness, particularly on the left side. A palpable mass was identified at the head vertex. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral parasagittal meningiomas with bone and sinus invasion of the SMA. A craniotomy was performed to remove the intracapsular tumor. Two days after the operation, the patient developed gradual deterioration in her motor function until it became a lock-in-like syndrome. Then, 1.5 months after treatment in the hospital and rehabilitation unit, she gradually improved her motor, cognitive, and psychomotor skills. Total recovery was achieved after 1 year. Surgery for lesions involving bilateral SMA can cause akinetic mutism. The typical manifestation of this syndrome may be devastating. However, it is reversible, and patients can regain full motor and cognitive functions over time without specific treatments. It is crucial to persevere and continue to provide the best care to the patient until recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_130_2024,PMC11090544,Akinetic mutism; Craniotomy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Parasagittal meningioma; Supplementary motor area,Case Reports,United States,eng

Rehabilitation was conducted on an individual basis in the brain injury unit of Beata Maria Ana hospital. Neuropsychological evaluation showed some difficulties not previously described together with these deficits, related to attention, working memory and executive functions, as well as topographic disorientation, lack of visuospatial coordination, distances perception disorders and difficulty to mentally rotate objects. The rehabilitation was AIMed not only at restoration but also compensation of visuospatial deficits, successfully achieved after treatment: patients were capable of returning to their daily activities, including their jobs. In patients with visuospatial deficits, a compressive neuropsychological evaluation seem to be essential to define the influence of the other cognitive domains over the rehabilitation of visuospatial problems.

Upon admission, computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large cystic right frontal defect and a suggested small tumor recurrence. White matter of the frontal lobe appeared to be translucent and compatible with previous radiation. The severe mental changes were initially attributed to a delayed radiation encephalopathy. Neuropathologically, the white matter of the frontal lobe showed mild elevated cell density consistent with gliosis; however, a tumor recurrence invading the tip of the corpus callosum and invading the entire length both fornices appeared. From the neuropathological findings of massive local tumor recurrence in both fornices, together with the acute clinical onset, it seems unlikely that the sequel of radiotherapy caused akinetic mutism, but the symmetric and severe involvement of the limbic system. We conclude that the rapid progression from a state of alertness to a full clinical picture of akinetic mutism was because of infiltration of both fornices.",{},,European journal of neurology,10.1046/j.1468-1331.2002.00386.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

She was treated with diuretics (and paracentesis). Recently (six-month earlier) a pan-encephalic radiotherapy was done because of brain and skull metastasis. Among blood tests, low serum levels of hypomagnesemia were observed. She developed PRES that rapidly progressed to lethargy, unresponsiveness till coma without changes in blood pressure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging study showed bilateral parieto-occipital edema and a thrombosis of left transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Anti-edema therapy, intravenous supplementation of magnesium and decoagulation were started, with complete and rapid recovery (within 18 hours) of clinical and radiologic changes. PRES diagnosis was based on the rapid clinical recovery after antiedema treatment and magnesium supplementation. Low magnesium level related to both diuretic and Fulvestrant/Palbociclib therapies and recent radiotherapy can represent potential mechanisms favouring PRES development. The previous bevacizumab treatment may also be involved as a PRES predisposing factor. The concomitant occurrence of cerebral thrombosis can have precipitated the clinical situation.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v91i2.8685,PMC7569613,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
22038693,Posterior fossa syndrome in an adult patient following surgical evacuation of an intracerebellar haematoma.,"De Smet, Hyo Jung; Mariën, Peter",De Smet,"The posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) consists of transient cerebellar mutism, cognitive symptoms and neurobehavioural abnormalities that typically develop in children following posterior fossa tumour resection. Although PFS has been documented in more than 350 paediatric cases, reports of adult patients with a vascular aetiology are extremely rare. In addition, the pathophysiological substrate of the syndrome remains unclear. We report an adult patient with PFS after surgical evacuation of a cerebellar bleeding. After 45 days of (akinetic) mutism, the patient's cognitive and behavioural profile closely resembled the ""cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome"". A quantified SPECT study showed perfusional deficits in the anatomoclinically suspected supratentorial areas, subserving language dynamics, executive functioning, spatial cognition and affective regulation. We hypothesize that cerebello-cerebral diaschisis might be an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying akinetic mutism, cognitive deficits and behavioural-affective changes in adult patients with PFS.",{},,"Cerebellum (London, England)",10.1007/s12311-011-0322-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Ten days later, positron emission tomography performed at rest showed decreased oxygen metabolism and blood flow at the site of the anatomic lesion and in remote areas such as the ipsilateral frontotemporoparietal cortex and the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Cerebellar hypometabolism has been ascribed to functional disconnection of the contralateral hemisphere from the cerebral cortex and has been termed crossed cerebellar diaschisis. One month later, positron emission tomography performed during unilateral motor activation (finger opposition) showed increased blood flow in the sensorimotor and supplementary motor areas contralateral to the hand engaged in the motor task. An at-rest study at this time showed resolution of the crossed cerebellar diaschisis observed acutely, but cerebellar asymmetry was demonstrated during performance of the motor task with the normal as well as with the previously paretic hand. Our activation study demonstrated cerebellar asymmetry in the chronic phase during a motor task, even though resting cerebellar blood flow was symmetrical.

Electromyography revealed a lack of burst activity in the left medial rectus; however, inhibition of the left (homolateral) and the right (contralateral) medial rectus muscles during off-saccades and in off-positions of gaze was normal. These observations suggest that inhibition for medial rectus motor neurons is not mediated by the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The findings are compatible with the neurophysiological data, which show that reductions of activity in the medial rectus motoneurons are largely caused by disfacilitation via internuclear neurons rather than by inhibition.",{},,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

She was a carrier of HTLV-I virus, and developed subacute right hemiparesis and marked motor aphasia. She had a malignant lymphoma in the left neck and basal cell carcinoma in the right inguinal region. Three months after the onset, she became unable to walk because of the right leg weakness or to speak because of motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal T2-high lesions in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy revealed demyelinating pathology. A biopsy of the left parotid gland revealed a diffuse pleomorphic type large B cell lymphoma. Although anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were found in the blood or CSF. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Neurological examinations revealed severe motor aphasia, mild sensory aphasia/cognitive impairment, right hemiplegia, mild right hemihypesthesia, limb-kinetic apraxia in the left hand, idiomotor apraxia, agraphia, perseveration, marked spasticity and brisk tendon reflex in four extremities, and positive bilateral pathological reflexes. MRI showed multifocal T2-high lesions mainly in the cerebral white matter, predominantly in the left hemisphere, and partly in the cerebral cortex. No gadolinium enhancement was found. In addition, 99mTcECD-SPECT showed a broad decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortex. Anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive but anti-HIV antibody was negative in serum. ATL cells were found in 1-3% of the peripheral white blood cells after admission. CSF examination revealed that the cell count (1/microl), protein level (24 mg/dl), and IgG index (0.4) were all normal. However, the myelin basic protein level (321 pg/ml; normal < 102) was increased, JC virus DNA was detected by PCR, and anti-HTLV-I antibody (x 8) was detected in CSF. The regulatory region of the JC virus DNA in the CSF was partly deleted; immunostaining with anti-JC virus protein antibodies revealed the existence of JC virus in biopsied brain specimens, and these findings were consistent with PML. Her symptoms such as motor aphasia, cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis were subacutely progressive, and she developed akinetic mutism two weeks after admission. Since the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside for PML has been reported, she was administered 80 mg/day of the drug for five days. After treatment, her communication function was mildly improved but the efficacy was transient. Since it has been reported that HTLV-I, as well as HIV, activates the JC virus promoter and its proliferation, the latent infection of HTLV-I in the central nervous system (CNS) in this case might have stimulated the JC virus proliferation, promoting lesion extension over the cerebral cortex. There have been only a few reports of broad decreases in CBF by SPECT in PML patients. Further MRI and SPECT studies on PML patients are therefore necessary to evaluate the significance of HTLV-I in promoting the JC virus infiltration into the CNS.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

We propose that the medial thalamic nuclei, particularly centromedian and parafascicularis (CMPF), are normally involved in the arousal-activation process by which an organism can be aroused by and respond to novel or important stimuli. Specifically, we propose that (1) the mesencephalic reticular formation subserves tonic arousal to novel or painful stimuli by inhibiting the nucleus reticularis thalami (NR) and (2) that selective attention is mediated by cortical input to NR. The CMPF is closely associated with motor systems (basal ganglia, ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus [VL], and frontal lobes). A pathway involving CMPF, the frontal cortex, and the portion of NR associated with VL may be important in preparing the tonically aroused organism for action. Unilateral lesions of CMPF therefore induce an asymmetric hypokinesia, and bilateral lesions may induce akinetic mutism.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1981.00510080063009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Clinical evaluation typically entails 2 consecutive formal neurological examinations to document total loss of consciousness and absence of brain stem reflexes and then apnea testing to evaluate carbon dioxide unresponsiveness within the brain stem. Confounding factors such as use of therapeutic hypothermia, high-dose metabolic suppression, and movements associated with complex spinal reflexes, fasciculations, or cardiogenic ventilator autotriggering may delay initiation or completion of brain death protocols.

The epilepsia partialis continua was difficult to control, and the underlying cause was uncertain even after thorough surveys for infection, inflammation, autoimmunity, and neoplasm. However, progressive signal intensity changes were noted over the involved cortical gyri, bilateral caudate, and putamen on serial magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted images, which were compatible with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. Therefore, we tested for 14-3-3 protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the results were positive. Multifocal myoclonus jerks, severe mental decline, akinetic mutism, and typical periodic sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram developed late in his disease course. He died under the hospice care, and his total disease duration was approximately 5 months.

Several studies have reported that combined administration of various medications may induce SS. We report a case of SS in a patient who was being treated with dopaminergic and noradrenergic drugs. A 55-year-old man with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage extending to the left cerebral hemisphere presented with clinical features of akinetic mutism. Three months after onset, dopaminergic (methylphenidate, levodopa/benserazide) and noradrenergic (atomoxetine) drugs were administered to enhance his cognitive function. His cognitive function gradually improved during 8 weeks of dose escalation. One day after the dose of atomoxetine was increased from 40 mg/d to 60 mg/d, the patient developed inducible clonus, rigidity, diarrhea, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, in keeping with a diagnosis of SS. The symptoms and signs suggestive of SS resolved on the day following cessation of all dopaminergic and noradrenergic drugs. This case demonstrates that medications generally known as dopaminergic or noradrenergic agents could have serotonergic effects via a mechanism that is yet to be fully elucidated.

This report presents a challenging case in which myositis ossificans was diagnosed and treated by medical management in a patient who was unable to complain of any symptoms due to akinetic mutism that occurred after nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had intermittent high-grade fever, and laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels without clinical signs of infection two months after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lower-extremity venography using computed tomography was performed to rule out deep venous thrombosis. There was no thrombus, but right vastus medialis muscle showed inflammatory change with faint multilayered curvilinear hyperdense rims. The administration of indomethacin helped prevent abnormal bone formation. For the early detection of myositis ossificans, careful observation of clinical presentation and a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary in brain-injured patients. Further, elevated serum inflammatory markers accompanied by elevated alkaline phosphatase can be a critical clue. Early computed tomography helps identify early 'string sign' prior to characteristic ossification.

Twelve patients underwent either one-stage or two-stage diagnosis and management of their brain tumors. Both techniques utilize high-resolution intraoperative stereotactic image-guided technology and rapid touch preparation (imprint) cytopathological techniques to confirm the presence of neoplasm. Following this pathologic diagnosis, six patients immediately underwent stereotactic radiosurgery employing the same frame application and dose planning based on preoperative and intraoperative images. Six patients underwent two-stage procedures, i.e., discharge from the hospital after histopathological diagnosis followed by readmission, reapplication of the stereotactic head frame, and repeat neuroradiological imaging prior to radiosurgery. Requirements for success of the single-stage procedure include intraoperative stereotactic high-resolution imaging, a hospital-wide ethernet system for transferring neurodiagnostic images, and expertise in rapid touch-preparation histopathological technique for accurate diagnosis. Intraoperative computed tomography imaging after biopsy confirmed the target accuracy and lack of movement of the target after brain biopsy. The advantages of the single-stage approach include reduced length of overall hospital stay, simultaneous histopathological diagnosis and therapy in a single hospital admission, and reduced total hospital charges.

Recent literatures have described anti-thyroid and infectious serology in this encephalitis but without follow-up. A 17-year-old Chinese female patient presented with psychiatric symptoms, memory deficits, behavioral problems and seizures. She then progressed through unresponsiveness, dyskinesias, autonomic instability and central hypoventilation during treatment. Her conventional blood work on admission showed high titers of IgG antibodies to thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase and IgM antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen. An immature ovarian teratoma was found and removal of the tumor resulted in a full recovery. The final diagnosis of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis was made by the identification of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies in her cerebral spinal fluid. Pathology studies of the teratoma revealed N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 positive ectopic immature nervous tissue and Epstein-Barr virus latent infection. She was discharged with symptoms free, but titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies remained elevated. One year after discharge, her serum remained positive for anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies, but negative for anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and IgM against Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen. Persistent high titers of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies from admission to discharge and until one year later in this patient may suggest a propensity to autoimmunity in anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and support the idea that neuronal and thyroid autoimmunities represent a pathogenic spectrum. Enduring anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies from admission to one year follow-up but seroreversion of Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen IgM may raise the important issue of elucidating the triggers and boosters of anti- N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-11-149,PMC3247181,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Although the pattern of cortical responses was abnormal, differential responses were clearly obtained to semantically different word classes.

A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on October 20, 1986, with a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. Microsurgery was performed immediately on the day of admission because cerebral angiography revealed bilateral distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. Consciousness gradually deteriorated due to cerebral vasospasm from the 3rd day following surgery. To protect the brain, corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 1500 mg, dexamethasone 252 mg) was administered for 26 days after surgery. In spite of treatment, in March 1987 neurological examination revealed akinetic mutism, but CT scan did not reveal any evidence of tumor. CT scan performed on May 2, 1987, revealed a mass lesion in the left frontotemporal lobes and left basal ganglia. Histological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (diffuse, large-cell type) was obtained by stereotactic biopsy. Radiotherapy (41 Gy of 60Co) was carried out. The CT scan performed on August 26, 1987 revealed that the abnormal enhanced lesion had disappeared. However, neurological findings had not remarkably improved. The patient died of renal failure in February 1988, but tumor recurrence had not been noted in CT scans. Autopsy could not be performed. Whole body CT scan and 67Gd scintigram did not reveal any other tumors except in the brain. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm followed by primary intracranial malignant lymphoma is very rarely reported.

Furthermore, she demonstrated progressive improvement in mood, interactivity, and overall neurologic function after ECT treatment was completed. The search for an etiology of a profound catatonic state should include the probability of underlying medical disorder.

25481469,Selective improvement of anosognosia for hemiplegia during transcranial direct current stimulation: a case report.,"Gandola, Martina; Sedda, Anna; Manera, Marina; Pingue, Valeria; Salvato, Gerardo; Spitoni, Grazia F; Pistarini, Caterina; Giorgi, Ines; Pizzamiglio, Luigi; Bottini, Gabriella",Gandola,"Right brain damage patients may not complain of a left sided paralysis up to the point of denying it or even claiming of having just moved an otherwise paralyzed limb. This condition is known as anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). Recent behavioural experiments suggest that some residual intentionality might be preserved in patients with anosognosia and that the false belief of having moved originates from a failure to notice discrepancies between movement expectancies and the actual state of the motor system. This failure may be caused by a lack of afferent sensory information concerning the movement or alternatively by a direct dysfunction of the brain regions involved in actions' motor monitoring (i.e., the comparator system). Here we examined the effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right premotor cortex in a patient with a bilateral lesion, involving predominantly the right hemisphere, and a dense unawareness for his left hemiplegia. During sham or anodal tDCS the patient was requested to judge his ability to perform simple motor actions (i) without actually executing the movement itself (""offline"" condition) and after having performed a series of verbally cued finger opposition movements (""online"" condition) with (i) eyes-closed or (ii) eyes-open. We found that anodal tDCS induces a significant remission of the false experience of movement only when the patient is requested to actually perform the movement with eyes open. Conversely, the patient's awareness does not improve in both the ""offline"" condition (in which the patient does not attempt to perform the movement) and in the ""online"" condition, when vision is precluded (""online"" condition, eyes-closed). We conclude that the stimulation of the premotor cortex by tDCS activates brain regions involved in motor monitoring, temporary restoring the ability of the motor comparator system to correctly appreciate afferent information and build up a veridical motor awareness.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.007,,Anosognosia for hemiplegia; Intention to move; Motor awareness; Neglect; Transcranial direct current stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

He presented with hypomania, psychosis, verbal unresponsiveness and disorientation. He engaged in compulsive onanism in public which resulted in the restriction of his freedom, suggesting impulse control disorder (ICD). Electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. Brain CT-scan showed post-traumatic bifrontal and left occipital lesions. Viral and bacterial serologies were normal. Lithium was initially reinstated (same dose), but it was aripiprazole reinstatement at a lower dose (10 mg) that made his condition rapidly improve within 24-36 h. Aripiprazole is a partial dopamine D2-receptor antagonist that blocks dopamine at higher dopamine concentrations and augments/releases prefrontal cortex dopamine at lower concentrations. The rapid recovery suggests stabilisation of dopamine levels in the frontal lobes and that ICD may be modified by aripiprazole treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr.09.2011.4756,PMC3229334,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In order to elucidate regional cerebral disturbances, brain metabolism was investigated with fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) 5.5 months after intoxication. Significantly reduced metabolic rates of glucose were revealed in selected brain regions, especially in both the frontal and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as in the subcortical white matter. Frontal and cingulate cortices showed a preserved metabolism of 35-53%, whereas the regional glucose consumption in cerebral white matter was reduced by more than 70%. In contrast, other areas of the brain such as the sensory-motor cortex, parts of the temporal lobes, basal ganglia and brainstem disclosed normal metabolic values. This lesion topography is discussed in relation to the development of akinetic mutism in the present case and in comparison with recent reports on the topic. Considering a plausible pathophysiology, akinetic mutism appears to be based on a different structural neuropathology when compared with the locked-in syndrome and the vegetative state. It is suggested that akinetic mutism is regarded as a specific condition characterized by injury of the frontal neuronal systems which promote executive functions.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050310001622806,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Independent observational study of 7 chronic SCI subjects undergoing surgery by Dr Hongyun Huang in Beijing. Assessments included lesion location by magnetic resonance imaging, protocol of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA), change in disability, and detailed history of the perioperative course. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were not clearly defined, as subjects with myelopathies graded ASIA A through D and of diverse causes were eligible. Cell injection sites did not always correlate with the level of injury and included the frontal lobes of a subject with a high cervical lesion. Complications, including meningitis, occurred in 5 subjects. Transient postoperative hypotonicity may have accounted for some physical changes. No clinically useful sensorimotor, disability, or autonomic improvements were found. The phenotype and the fate of the transplanted cells, described as olfactory ensheathing cells, are unknown. Perioperative morbidity and lack of functional benefit were identified as the most serious clinical shortcomings.

For the brain SPECT study, radiotracer was injected during the preictal (11s prior to seizure onset), ictal (at 25 s out of 47 s seizure duration) and interictal periods. Interictal SPECT was subtracted from preictal or ictal-injection SPECTs and then the subtracted SPECTs were overlaid on the patient's MRI (SISCOM). SISCOM with preictal-injection SPECT showed hyperperfusion at the brain lesion, whereas SISCOM with ictal-injection SPECT showed hyperperfusion at the ipsilateral amygdala-hippocampus and hypoperfusion around the tumor lesion. After the DNT and nearby temporal lobe tissues were resected with preservation of amygdala-hippocampus, the patient became seizure free without complaint of subjective postsurgical memory decline.

24020424,A comprehensive exercise program for a young adult male with Down syndrome who experienced a stroke.,"Casey, Amanda Faith; Mackay-Lyons, Marilyn; Connolly, Eilish Marie; Jennings, Craig; Rasmussen, Roy",Casey,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) may be at heightened risk for stroke due to a combination of physiological conditions and lifestyle choices. There remains a lack of information regarding the effectiveness of exercise training on individuals with DS post-stroke. This case report describes the effects of a comprehensive exercise program on an individual with DS who had sustained a stroke. A 20-year-old male with DS recovering from a left hemorrhagic stroke 18 months previous underwent a 12-week land and water-based program 60 minutes/session, 5 sessions/week. Exercise sessions addressed specific limitations, including cardiorespiratory fitness, generalized muscle weakness, balance deficits, and reduced ambulatory ability in terms of speed, gait pattern and walking tolerance. Between the baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments improvements were noted in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak, 8% increase), one-repetition maximum (51%), community balance and mobility scale (54%), comfortable walking speed (42%), six-minute walk test (28%) and daily step count (21%). Improved cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, balance and mobility provide preliminary evidence of the trainability of individuals with both DS and stroke. Future studies are warranted to investigate the role of exercise in risk factor reduction for primary and secondary prevention of stroke in people with DS. Implications for Rehabilitation Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) may be at heightened risk of stroke due to a combination of physiological conditions and lifestyle choices which contribute to reduced exercise capacity, accelerated aging patterns, moyamoya syndrome and physical inactivity as well as high rates of obesity and related conditions. More intensive fitness programs may be particularly important for people with both DS and stroke. Participation in a comprehensive exercise program can be safe and effective in regaining pre-stroke levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, functional mobility and goal attainment. RESULTS suggest that a more intensive physical therapy regimen may be recommendable during out-patient rehabilitation for individuals with DS post-stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Disability and rehabilitation,10.3109/09638288.2013.833304,,Down syndrome; exercise training; single subject design; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There are reports of successful treatment of akinetic mutism, the most severe form of abulia, with bromocriptine. Four case studies are presented describing the successful treatment of abulia at a lesser severity than akinetic mutism with bromocriptine. Abulia was caused by brain damage due to alcohol in two cases, Wilson's disease and basal ganglia infarct in one each. Maximum bromocriptine dose varied from 25-70 mg. All improved considerably. Withdrawal or reduction of medication in three produced deterioration. The prescription of a neuroleptic drug had a similar effect in the fourth. One patient with a previous history developed a depressive relapse and so the drug was withdrawn and lisuride introduced. This produced a similar improvement. These cases highlight the value of identifying the syndrome of organic abulia and suggest that dopamine agonists may have a place in its treatment, though controlled studies are needed.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.54.8.718,PMC1014478,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Neurotoxicity from OKT3 usually manifests itself as a transient aseptic meningitis and remains uncommon. The authors describe a dramatic neurologic syndrome after orthotopic heart transplant characterized by akinetic mutism, blepharospasm, anomic aphasia, and delirium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed meningeal enhancement and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed markedly reduced tracer uptake. Discontinuation of OKT3 resulted in resolution of this neuropsychiatric syndrome and reversal of abnormalities on neuroimaging that coincided with normalization of CD3+ lymphocyte count. In the initial posttransplant period, it remains difficult to attribute encephalopathic signs to toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs. However, MRI and cerebral perfusion studies may help support the diagnosis. More precise characterization of the prevalence of OKT3-associated encephalopathy could come from prospective SPECT studies.",{},,Transplantation,10.1097/01.TP.0000057830.67416.CE,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 123I-IMP single photon emission CT disclosed remarkable hypoperfusion in the bilateral frontal cortex. After a week of somnolence, he gradually became wakeful, but was still abulic. Neuropsychological examinations revealed no memory disturbance. We consider that disconnection of the thalamo-frontal projection at the genua of the internal capsules caused somnolence, apathy, and abulia in our case. The hitherto reported cases of the genu infarcts that showed memory disturbance had the lesion involving both the inferior thalamic peduncle and its nearby mamillothalamic tract. In contrast, our case without memory disturbance had infarcts confined to the genua apparently sparing the two tracts, implicating that memory function may be preserved when such structures are intact.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

A 47 year-old man, who had an episode of sudden upper air-way obstruction although his radial artery pulsation was maintained, and then suffered from akinetic mutism and myoclonus for 2 years and 5 months, died of bronchopneumonia. Postmortem examination revealed that, in addition to wide distribution of mild neuronal loss and astrocytosis in the cerebral and cerebellar gray matter, focal pseudolaminer necrosis of the IIIrd and IVth cortical layers was predominantly noticed in the calcarine cortex, pre- and postcentral gyri and transverse temporal cortex. However, the cortical architecture of the Ammon's horn, arterial boundary zones and depths and sides of sulci was not involved. This topography of neuronal degeneration was considered to correspond with those of methyl-mercury intoxication. However, his history and neurological examination before the episode denied the intoxication.

The patient, a 64-year-old man, was admitted to Gifu University Hospital because of a decrease in spontaneous activity, lack of volition and anorexia. The CT scan, performed on July 29, 1987, demonstrated lacune in the right internal capsule (IC), periventricular lucency especially around the anterior horn of lateral ventricles, and ventricular dilatation. He was transferred to a medical ward because of repeated aspiration pneumonia. Neurological examination revealed mutism, pseudobulbar palsy, and frontal lobe signs. The CT scan, performed on March 30 1988, demonstrated the newly developed lacune in the left IC. The MRI also showed two coinciding lacunes, one in the genu of the right IC and the other in the anterior limb of the left IC. The SPECT with 123I iodoamphetamine showed decreased blood supply predominantly to the frontal lobes. A mechanism by which the mutism occurs is discussed from two points of view, pseudobulbar palsy and frontal lobe syndrome. He developed initially frontal lobe syndrome in which paucity of spontaneous speech was noted. The CT scan at that time demonstrated lacune in the right IC. About eight months later when he became mute, the CT scan showed lacunes in bilateral ICs without any other low density areas in frontal language areas such as Broca's area, subcortical area and supplementary motor area. As the MRI showed that the right lacune was in the genu but the left lacune was in the anterior limb of IC, the left cortico-bulbar tract was thought to be not directly involved. The SPECT showed decreased blood supply predominantly to the frontal lobes. Although dysphagia improved, mutism did not improve at all. Therefore it is postulated that both pseudobulbar palsy and frontal lobe dysfunction might play a role in producing the mutism of this patient.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

The diagnosis of measles encephalitis (ME) is established when supported by the clinical picture, mainly of juvenile onset, and confirmed by the presence of cerebrospinal measles antibodies. Although ME is clinically characterized by progressive behavioral and mental deterioration associated with myoclonus, prior reports have suggested that adult-onset may have atypical features. We describe a 28 year-old immunocompetent man, admitted into the hospital due to a rapid motor and cognitive decline after an episode of fever and gastroenteritis. His neurological examination was significant for cognitive impairment, cervical dystonia, spontaneous and action induced myoclonus, choreiform movements, parkinsonism and ataxic gait. He was diagnosed of acute postinfectious ME based on the presence of elevated intrathecal synthesis of measles antibodies in his CSF, and a lymphocytic infiltrate of perivascular distribution without viral inclusions, with PCR negative for measles from brain biopsy. The patient continued to deteriorate to an akinetic mutism state, dying a few weeks later. Adult-onset ME is an entity rarely seen in the Western world.

19877558,[Acute glyphosate-surfactant poisoning with neurological sequels and fatal outcome].,"Potrebić, Olivera; Jović-Stosić, Jasmina; Vucinić, Slavica; Tadić, Jelena; Radulac, Misel",Potrebić,"Clinical picture of severe glyphosate-surfactant poisoning is manifested by gastroenteritis, respiratory disturbances, altered mental status, hypotension refractory to the treatment, renal failure, shock. Single case report indicated possible neurotoxic sequels of glyphosate-surfactant exposure with white matter lesions and development of Parkinsonism. We described a patient with massive white matter damage which led to vigil coma and lethal outcome. A 56-year old woman ingested about 500 mL of herbicide containing glyphosate isopropylamine salt. The most prominent manifestation of poisoning included hypotension, coma, hyperkaliemia, respiratory and renal failure. The patient was treated in intensive care unit by symptomatic and supportive therapy including mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. The patient survived the acute phase of poisoning, but she developed vigil coma. Nuclear magnetic imagining revealed extensive bilateral lesions of the brain stem white matter and pons. The outcome of reported poisoning may be the consequence of glyphosate-surfactant neurotoxic effect or/and ischemia, especially in the episodes of marked hypotension during hemodialysis. Considering recommendation of early hemodialysis as the treatment of choice, even before renal failure development, we point out the importance of careful planning of dialysis modality in hemodynamically instable patient and recommend continuous dialysis methods.",{},,Vojnosanitetski pregled,10.2298/vsp0909758p,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Serbia,srp
21510236,Early ischemic lesions following subarachnoid hemorrhage: common cold remedy as precipitating factor?,"Genonceaux, Sandrine; Cosnard, Guy; Van De Wyngaert, Françoise; Hantson, Philippe",Genonceaux,"A 46-year-old woman presented with tetraplegia contrasting with a relatively preserved consciousness following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Multiple ischemic lesions were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in the absence of vasospasm or signs of increased intracranial pressure. During the weeks before SAH, the patient had repeatedly used a nasal decongestant containing phenylephrine. After coiling of the aneurysm harboured by the right posterior cerebral artery, symptomatic vasospasm developed in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery and required aggressive therapy by intra-arterial infusion of milrinone followed by continuous intravenous administration. Follow-up MRI did not reveal new ischemic lesions. Echocardiography had demonstrated the presence of a patent foramen ovale. At 3 months follow-up, a major motor deficit persisted with akinetic mutism. The mechanisms of multiple early infarction following aneurysmal SAH are still debated, as vasospasm is usually not seen on the first imaging. Among precipitating factors of microvascular vasospasm, vasoactive substances like phenylephrine, may play a significant role.",{},,Acta neurologica Belgica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
11738017,[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with unilateral onset: clinical profile and neuroimaging].,"Blasco Olcina, R; Yaya Huamán, R; Garcés Sánchez, M; Villanueva Haba, V E; Bataller Alberola, L; Baquero Toledo, M",Blasco Olcina,"The usual clinical profile of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is that of subacute dementia and intractable myoclonus. Occasionally, some cases present peculiar clinical features. We report on a case of CJD with an unilateral onset showing remarkable neuroimaging features. The patient, aged 72 years, began to suffer from sudden anomia, initially restricted to persons; but in a few weeks it evolved into a global aphasia, right hemiparesis, severe gait disorder, and finally akinetic mutism and intractable myoclonus. He died 11 weeks after onset. Early in the course, an analysis of 14-3-3 protein in CSF was positive. In advanced disease, the EEG showed the typical periodic activity of CJD. FLAIR MRI study showed a mesencephalic and focal cortical hyperintensity. Autopsy was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of CJD with an extensive presence of generalised spongiosis in cerebral grey matter. This case illustrates the usefulness of the life recent paraclinical methods to diagnose CJD in life. New MRI techniques seems to be particularly relevant, as they are not limited to exclude other conditions but can also offer data with validity to a positive diagnosis, like grey matter hyperintensity, that in this case was present also in the midbrain.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
10065467,"[A 96-year-old man with consciousness disturbance, convulsion, and left hemiplegia of acute onset].","Kanazawa, A; Noda, K; Suzuki, H; Ohta, S; Mori, H; Suda, K; Takubo, H; Mizuno, Y",Kanazawa,"We report a 96-year-old Japanese man who developed a sudden onset of left hemiplegia and coma. He was found to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation since 1996 with occasional episodes of congestive heart failure. He was otherwise apparently well until July 5 of 1997 when he developed a sudden onset of unresponsiveness and convulsion involving his right hand and was admitted to our hospital. On admission, his BP was 210/120 mmHg, heart rate 76/min and irregular, BT 36.5 degrees C, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration. General medical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed semicoma, conjugated deviation to the right, loss of oculocephalic response, left facial paresis of central type, flaccid left hemiplegia, and bilateral Babinski sign. Pertinent laboratory findings are as follows: BUN 47 mg/dl, creatinine 1.46 mg/dl, GPT 69 IU/l, LDH 1,142 IU/l, and CK 385 IU/l. A chest x-ray film revealed cardiac enlargement and EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation. Cranial CT scan revealed low density areas involving the right anterior cerebral and the right posterior cerebral artery territories. He was treated with an intravenous osmotic agent and short course of intramuscular steroid. He remained unconscious despite these treatment and developed sudden cardiopulmonary arrest three weeks after the admission. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had suffered from cerebral embolism of cardiac origin. The cause of the death was ascribed to acute subendocardial myocardial infarction. Most of the participants agreed with this conclusion. Postmortem examination revealed an old subendocardial myocardial infarction involving the posterior septal region and posterolateral wall of the left ventricle. Neuropathologic examination revealed hemorrhagic infarctions involving the territories of the right anterior cerebral, right middle cerebral, right posterior cerebral, and left anterior cerebral arteries. The left A1 portion of the anterior cerebral artery was hypoplastic, and the left pericallosal artery appeared to have been receiving blood supply from the right anterior cerebral artery through the anterior communicating artery. The large arteries in the base showed marked arteriosclerosis; particularly, the initial portion of the right posterior artery showed near complete arteriosclerotic occlusions. These characteristic arterial changes appeared to be the reason why this patient suffered from an extensive infarction from what appeared to have been a single episode of cerebral embolism probably initially involving the right internal carotid artery.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Clinical Conference; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

The signs and symptoms included seizures and focal parieto-occipital dysfunction in 1 case, massive left hemisphere dysfunction and akinetic mutism in the other. Brain CT and MRI showed nonspecific focal white matter abnormalities suggestive of the diagnosis of low-grade glioma. Gradient echo T1 and T2-weighted images showing multiple areas of signal void suggesting multiple disseminated petechial hemorrhages led to the diagnosis of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. An eventless brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The neuropathology examination disclosed amyloid angiopathy of the pial and cortical vessels selectively stained by anti A-beta protein antibodies.

He had hypertension and alcoholic liver cirrhosis as past history. When he was 62 years old, he realized rt. hemiplegia suddenly and admitted in Juntendo Urayasu hospital. Brain CT showed intracranial hemorrhage in lt. putamen. He was treated with neurosurgery operation for rejecting hemorrhage. Mild rt. hemiparesis remained but he could live independently. He was medicated sulpiride for depression after cerebrovascular accident. On 63 years old, resting tremor and rigidity appeared on his rt. hand. His doctor stopped sulpiride and treated with L-Dopa/Benserazide and trihexiphenidyl. His parkinsonism was stable with this treatment for four years. His doctor considered that he was Parkinson's disease or drug-induced parkinsonism. On 67 years old, he became akinetic-mutism state suddenly and admitted in the hospital. His consciousness turned alert soon and discharged after two weeks. This episode was considered as epilepsy. After one week from discharge, he was found cardio-pulmonary arrest and confirmed dead in the hospital. Post-mortem examination revealed necrosis in the posterior-lateral part of lt. putamen due to hemorrhage. However, there was no degenerative change of the striatum or the substantia nigra and no Lewy bodies in his brain. Other pathological changes were also not found. His parkinsonism might be caused putaminal pathology due to hemorrhage.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Clinical Conference; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
