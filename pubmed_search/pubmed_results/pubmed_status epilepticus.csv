31228700,Status epilepticus in Hashimoto's encephalopathy.,"Ercoli, Tommaso; Defazio, Giovanni; Muroni, Antonella",Ercoli,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a non-infectious, probably autoimmune encephalitis, characterized by varied signs coupled with elevated levels of anti-thyroid antibodies and, often, good response to corticosteroid therapy. Seizures, namely focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonus, and status epilepticus, are frequent manifestations of Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Typically, seizures in these patients respond poorly to anti-epileptic drugs. Although cases of Hashimoto's encephalopathy with status epilepticus have been reported in literature, they vary in demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics. We could not identify any systematic review summarizing the evidence in regard to factors predicting the occurrence of status epilepticus in Hashimoto's encephalopathy and the responsiveness of status epilepticus to anti-epileptic drugs, steroids and other immunomodulatory medication. Therefore, we performed an extensive review of the literature to identify and compare Hashimoto's encephalopathy patients presenting with and without status epilepticus. In 31 patients with status epilepticus and 104 patients without status epilepticus, thyroid status, anti-thyroid antibodies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, brain MRI/CT/SPECT scan did not predict occurrence of status epilepticus of variable phenomenology. Status epilepticus did not respond to anti-epileptic drugs but completely remitted under steroid treatment, alone or in combination with other immunomodulatory medication, in about three quarter of patients. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus might be a factor negatively influencing outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2019.06.020,,Hashimoto’s encephalopathy; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng
35630076,Wernicke Encephalopathy Mimicking MELAS.,"Finsterer, Josef",Finsterer,"a stroke-like lesion, the morphological equivalent of a stroke-like episode and the hallmark of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, have not been reported as manifestations of thiamine deficiency. a 62-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted after a series of epileptic seizures. Upon waking up from the coma, he presented with disorientation, confusion, confabulation, psychomotor agitation, aggressiveness, right hemianopsia, aphasia, and right hemineglect over weeks. Electroencephalography showed a questionable focal status epilepticus over the left hemisphere, responsive to lorazepam and oxcarbazepine. Follow-up electroencephalographies no longer recorded epileptiform discharges. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2-/diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in the left occipito-temporal region that was not congruent to a vascular territory which persisted for at least nine weeks. Since a lactate-peak could be seen in this lesion by magnetic resonance-spectroscopy, this was interpreted as a stroke-like lesion. Since thiamine was reduced, the stroke-like lesion was attributed to thiamine deficiency after the exclusion of differential diseases, including MELAS and status epilepticus. The patient's behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions largely resolved upon vitamin-B1 substitution. the case suggests that thiamine deficiency presumably causes mitochondrial dysfunction with cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis and a stroke-like lesion mimicking MELAS syndrome. It should be further studied whether nutritional deficits, such as thiamine deficiency, could give rise to secondary stroke-like lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58050660,PMC9144475,Wernicke encephalopathy; lactic acidosis; spectroscopy; stroke-like episode; stroke-like lesion; thiamine deficiency,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

27056863,[Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus].,"Mizobuchi, Masahiro",Mizobuchi,"Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a type of status epilepticus (SE) lacking a predominant motor manifestation. The annual prevalence of NCSE is estimated to reach 10 to 20 cases in every 100,000 people. While almost half of all SE cases are nonconvulsive, there are several different types of NCSE: 1) epileptic absence SE, 2) epileptic focal seizure SE with consciousness disturbance (complex partial SE), 3) de novo NCSE of late onset, 4) NCSE due to acute brain injury or prolonged consciousness disturbance after convulsive SE. An electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation is necessary to diagnose NCSE. However, continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring over at least 24 hours is preferable to detect NCSE, as cognitive disturbances due to this condition may fluctuate over time. In addition, neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI with arterial spin labeled sequences or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate hyperperfused areas in cases of focal onset. Thus, patients presenting with alternative cognitive disturbance with or without mild confusion should be evaluated using cEEG monitoring or blood flow imaging so as not to overlook treatable NCSE.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,10.11477/mf.1416200418,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

We present the case of a 64-year-old woman who presented to hospital with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Her parathyroid hormone (PTH) level on admission was elevated at 1,330ng/l (normal range15-68ng/l) and her serum calcium measured 4.83mmol/l (normal range 2.25-2.54mmol/l). Technectium-99m sestamibi scan demonstrated a focus of radiotracer uptake consistent with a right upper parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. After commencing appropriate medical treatment, the patient developed intractable seizures necessitating endotracheal intubation. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain revealed bilateral symmetrical T2 hyperintensities in the posterior circulation consistent with PRES. Following stabilisation and further medical treatment for hypercalcaemia, the patient underwent a parathyroidectomy. Preoperative rapid PTH assay measured 1,021ng/l. Following excision, PTH levels fell to just 10ng/l. She was extubated in the intensive care unit on postoperative day 1 and made an uneventful recovery. At her 6-week follow-up appointment, all neurological symptoms had resolved. PRES is a rare neurological entity more often seen in the setting of hypertension, immunosuppression and renal failure.

30285858,The critical interaction between valproate sodium and warfarin: case report and review.,"Zhou, Chenguang; Sui, Yi; Zhao, Weijin; Dong, Chunyao; Ren, Li; Song, Pingmei; Xu, Bing; Sun, Xiaohong",Zhou,"Valproic acid (VPA) and warfarin are commonly prescribed for patients with epilepsy and concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF). When VPA and warfarin are prescribed together, clinically important interactions may occur. VPA may replace warfarin from the protein binding sites and result in an abnormally increased anticoagulation effect. This is commonly underrecognized. In our case, we report a 78-year-old woman with a glioma who presented with status epilepticus. The patient was on warfarin to prevent cardiogenic embolism secondary to AF. Intravenous loading dose of VPA was administered, but international normalized ratio (INR) increased significantly to 8.26. Intravenous vitamin K1 was then given and the patient developed no overt bleeding during the hospitalization. By reviewing the literature and discussing the critical interaction between valproate sodium and warfarin, we conclude that intravenous VPA and the co-administrated warfarin may develop critical but underrecognized complications due to effects on the function of hepatic enzymes and displacement of protein binding sites.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC pharmacology & toxicology,10.1186/s40360-018-0251-0,PMC6167846,Epilepsy; Interaction; International normalized ratio; Valproic acid; Warfarin,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

35647328,Rare pitfall in the magnetic resonance imaging of status epilepticus.,"Al-Chalabi, Mustafa; Bajrami, Silvi; Karim, Nurose; Sheikh, Ajaz",Al-Chalabi,"Brain MRI in Status Epilepticus (SE) is often helpful in diagnosis, lateralization and localization of the seizure focus. MRI changes in SE include predominantly ipsilateral diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) changes in the hippocampus and pulvinar or similar changes involving basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, brain stem and external capsule (Chatzikonstantinou et al., 2011 [1]). These changes are thought to be due to transient vasogenic and cytotoxic edema due to either transient damage or breakdown of blood brain barrier, proportional to the frequency and duration of the epileptic activity (Amato et al., 2001 [2]). Such changes may also be reflected on T2- weighted and T2-Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences of MRI. Herein, we present a case of a transient FLAIR cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hyperintensity on the second MRI brain in a patient with focal status epilepticus. This imaging finding led to diagnostic confusion and was initially thought to represent subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lumbar puncture, brain computed tomography (CT), and a follow-up brain MRI ruled out that possibility and other CSF pathologies. We concluded that the transient FLAIR changes in the second brain MRI were related to a rare imaging pitfall caused by Gadolinium enhancement of CSF on the FLAIR sequence, popularly referred to as hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM).","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,eNeurologicalSci,10.1016/j.ensci.2022.100405,PMC9136252,FLAIR; HARM; MRI pitfall; Status Epilepticus; Subarachnoid space,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

22179485,Diffusion-weighted imaging for the differential diagnosis of disorders affecting the hippocampus.,"Förster, A; Griebe, M; Gass, A; Kern, R; Hennerici, M G; Szabo, K",Förster,"The human hippocampus can be affected in a large variety of very different neurological diseases, of which acute ischemic stroke, transient global amnesia, epilepsy, and limbic encephalitis are the most common. Less frequent etiologies include various infections and encephalopathy of different origins. Clinical presentation notably comprises confusional state, altered vigilance, memory deficits of various extent and seizures. While in hypoxic or hypoglycemic encephalopathy, clinical presentation and surrounding circumstances provide some clues to reach the correct diagnosis, in the above-listed more common disorders, signs and symptoms might overlap, making the differential diagnosis difficult. This review presents recent studies using the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technique in diseases involving the hippocampus. References for the review were identified through searches of PubMed from 1965 to January 2011. Only papers published in English were reviewed. Full articles were obtained and references were checked for additional material where appropriate. All pathologies affecting the hippocampus are associated with distinct lesion patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, and especially DWI has the ability to demonstrate even minute and transient hippocampal lesions. In acute ischemic stroke in the posterior cerebral artery territory, involvement of the hippocampal formation occurs in four distinct patterns on DWI that can be easily differentiated and correspond to the known vascular anatomy of the hippocampus. In the subacute phase after transient global amnesia (TGA), dot-like hyperintense lesions are regularly found in the lateral aspect of the hippocampus on DWI. The DWI lesions described after prolonged seizures or status epilepticus include unilateral or bilateral hippocampal, thalamic, and cortical lesions of various extent, not restricted to vascular territories. In limbic encephalitis, DWI lesions are only infrequently found and usually affect the hippocampus, uncus and amygdala. Furthermore, in some rare cases DWI lesions of different etiology may coexist. In patients with diseases affecting the hippocampus, DWI appears to be useful in differentiating between underlying pathologies and may facilitate a definite diagnosis conducive to an optimal treatment. With a careful clinical examination, experience with the interpretation of DWI findings and knowledge of associated phenomena, it is indeed possible to differentiate between ischemic, ictal, metabolic, and TGA-associated findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",10.1159/000332036,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

We report two cases of bromisoval-induced bromism with status epilepticus. Presence of pseudohyperchloremia and history of over-the-counter medication use guided the diagnosis. In the acute phase, our patients showed bilateral medial thalamic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging findings were similar to those of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Although these findings improved in the chronic phase, neuropsychiatric sequelae, such as confabulation and amnesia, occurred. Bromism can cause acute encephalopathy, and it is important to differentiate it from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-02712-3,PMC9109394,Bromism; Bromisoval; Bromovalerylurea; Korsakoff’s syndrome; Status epilepticus; Wernicke’s encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
37609856,Diaschisis in the human brain reveals specificity of cerebrocerebellar connections.,"Guell, Xavier; Schmahmann, Jeremy D",Guell,"Anatomical studies in animals and imaging studies in humans show that cerebral sensorimotor areas map onto corresponding cerebellar sensorimotor areas and that cerebral association areas map onto cerebellar posterior lobe regions designated as the representation of the association (cognitive and limbic) cerebellum. We report a patient with unilateral left hemispheric status epilepticus, whose brain MRI revealed diffuse unihemispheric cerebral cortical FLAIR and diffusion signal hyperintensity but spared primary motor, somatosensory, visual, and to lesser extent auditory cerebral cortices. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (dysfunction at a site remote from, but connected to, the location of the primary lesion) showed signal hyperintensity in the right cerebellar posterior lobe and lobule IX, with sparing of the anterior lobe, and lobule VIII. This unique topographic pattern of involvement and sparing of cerebral and cerebellar cortical areas matches the anatomical and functional connectivity specialization in the cerebrocerebellar circuit. This first demonstration of within-hemispheric specificity in the areas affected and spared by cerebrocerebellar diaschisis provides further confirmation in the human brain for topographic organization of connections between the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The Journal of comparative neurology,10.1002/cne.25534,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The patient was started on a 14-day course with high-dose intravenous penicillin. After this treatment, the patient made significant recovery with improved cognitive function, evidenced by his Mini-mental State Examination score of 21. However, before this treatment, he could not cooperate with this exam. General paresis of the insane typically has a progressive course and normally presents 10 to 30 years after the initial infection. The manifestations of this patient and his suspicious history of transient ischemic attacks may mislead to the diagnosis of Todd's paresis or stroke.

A 53-year-old right-handed woman was admitted to hospital due to a large frontal left intraparenchymal hematoma. Over two and a half days, we captured recurrent non-convulsive electrographic and electroclinical seizures compatible with the diagnosis of intracortical focal NCSE. The patient remained sedated and a burst-suppression pattern was obtained. We also performed invasive brain multimodality monitoring including iEEG and measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), partial brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO<sub>2</sub>) and brain temperature. During non-convulsive electrographic and electroclinical seizures, the values of PbtO<sub>2</sub> decreased and those of ICP increased. Six months later, brain MRI revealed encephalomalacia localized to the left paramedial fronto-basal region. The neuropsychological assessment carried out one year after the injury showed scores below average in verbal learning memory, motor dexterity and executive functions. In summary, iEEG is a feasible innovative invasive technique that may be used to record non-convulsive electrographic and electroclinical seizures which remain invisible on the surface.

We report a 69-year-old male patient with a pre-existing left parietal oligodendroglioma WHO III after two resections and radio-chemotherapy. The patient was left with some word finding difficulties but had no history of overt seizures. He developed aphasic NCSE, which was only detected by long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. The 24-hour EEG revealed paroxysmal rhythmic theta-delta activity in left posterior regions that propagated to left temporo-parietal areas. Rhythmic activity appeared every 15-30 min and lasted for 10-110 s. Aphasia was continuously present with superimposed short-lasting clinical deteriorations during the day. Magnetic resonance imaging showed peri-ictal edema on diffusion-weighted images in the insula and fronto-parietal cortex, which supported the diagnosis of SE. NCSE persisted for seven months. The patient recovered upon addition of intravenous phenytoin. One should not only consider aphasic SE when language impairment is episodic, but also when there are prolonged manifestations, especially when the typical differential diagnoses have been excluded. Intravenous therapy may be required to terminate NCSE.

Continuous EEG recording showed epileptiform discharges that would appear, disappear, and reappear over a 3-week period. It took 3 weeks and 4 antiepileptic drugs to fully suppress cortical hyperexcitability, perhaps because injury to some midbrain structures resulted in global lowering of the seizure threshold. The most important risk factor for stroke-onset seizures appears to be posterior circulation stroke, particularly brainstem infarction.

10478706,Nonconvulsive status epilepticus in acute brain injury.,"Jordan, K G",Jordan,"Whether or not nonconvulsive status epilepticus produces permanent brain damage is a source of controversy. Contributing to the controversy is the lack of clarity for classifying the clinical and electrographic phenomena that constitute nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus commonly occurs in the context of an acute brain injury. For example, it commonly persists in generalized convulsive status epilepticus after convulsive activity has stopped, and it is not uncommonly associated with acute cerebral ischemia. Its clinical characteristics are ambiguous, subtle, and nonspecific making the diagnosis difficult. In the absence of EEG testing, it is likely to be missed or delayed. When acute brain injury and nonconvulsive status epilepticus occur concurrently, the severity of acute brain injury has traditionally been accepted as determining patient outcome. However, increasing evidence suggests that the two conditions are synergistically detrimental and increase brain injury. Guidelines remain to be established for the intensity and duration of anticonvulsant therapy in these patients. Evidence suggests that, in the absence of extreme and irreversible acute brain injury, early intensive intervention is necessary to improve the otherwise poor outcome of these patients.",{},,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,10.1097/00004691-199907000-00005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The rash was observed to be in a dermatomal distribution, and a diagnosis of herpes zoster was made. The patient was discharged home on valacyclovir 1 g 3 times a day for a duration of 7 days. The patient took 2 doses of valacyclovir before presenting to the hospital again with irritability and hallucinations. Over the next several days, the patient's neurologic status declined and he became disoriented and increasingly somnolent. Because of a concern for varicella zoster virus (VZV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV) meningoencephalitis, acyclovir was initiated intravenously at 600 mg (10 mg/kg) for every 12 hours. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain failed to reveal an acute process. Electroencephalogram was interpreted as seizure activity versus metabolic encephalopathy. Lumbar puncture was not suggestive for meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or HSV/VZV infection. The patient subsequently had a witnessed seizure during dialysis and was felt to have status epilepticus due to acyclovir and valacyclovir neurotoxicity. The patient underwent daily hemodialysis for removal of the drug and eventually made a full neurologic recovery. Our case highlights that acyclovir neurotoxicity can result in status epilepticus, hallucinations, and altered consciousness.

Patient 2. A 49-year-old man, who was treated with whole brain radiation 20 years before the onset of symptoms, developed some episodes consisting of headache and numbness of the right side of face and right arm; the latest episodes were accompanied by visual disturbances followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Patient 3. A 40-year-old man, who received cranial irradiation 20 years before, suffered three episodes of behavioral disturbance, aphasia, headache, and visual aura followed by left homonymous hemianopia. All three patients suffered seizures mostly with visual aura. Electroencephalography showed interictal epileptiform discharges or focal slowing.

Super-refractory SE (SRSE) is characterized by ongoing status despite 48 h of anaesthetic treatment. Due to the high case fatality in RSE of 16-39%, off label treatments without strong evidence of efficacy in RSE are often administered. In single case-reports and small case series totalling 28 patients, acute implantation of VNS in RSE was associated with 76% and 26% success rate in generalized and focal RSE respectively. We performed an updated systematic review of the literature on efficacy of VNS in RSE/SRSE by including all reported patients. We systematically searched EMBASE, CENTRAL, Opengre.eu, and ClinicalTrials.gov, and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting the use of VNS for RSE and/or SRSE. We also searched conference abstracts from AES and ILAE meetings. 45 patients were identified in total of which 38 were acute implantations of VNS in RSE/SRSE. Five cases had VNS implantation for epilepsia partialis continua, one for refractory electrical status epilepticus in sleep and one for acute encephalitis with refractory repetitive focal seizures. Acute VNS implantation was associated with cessation of RSE/SRSE in 74% (28/38) of acute cases. Cessation did not occur in 18% (7/38) of cases and four deaths were reported (11%); all of them due to the underlying disease and unlikely related to VNS implantation. Median duration of the RSE/SRSE episode pre and post VNS implantation was 18 days (range: 3-1680 days) and 8 days (range: 3-84 days) respectively. Positive outcomes occurred in 82% (31/38) of cases. VNS can interrupt RSE and SRSE in 74% of patients; data originate from reported studies classified as level IV and the risk for reporting bias is high. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate acute VNS in RSE and SRSE.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Brain stimulation,10.1016/j.brs.2019.05.011,,Neurointensive care; Seizures; Status epilepticus; Vagus nerve stimulation,Case Reports; Journal Article; Systematic Review,United States,eng

Few published studies have investigated neurostimulation treatment options in the setting of SRSE. This systematic literature review and series of 10 cases investigated the safety and efficacy of implanting and activating the responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system acutely during SRSE and discusses the rationale for lead placement and selection of stimulation parameters. Through a literature search (of databases and American Epilepsy Society abstracts that were last searched on March 1, 2023) and direct contact with the manufacturer of the RNS system, 10 total cases were identified that utilized RNS acutely during SE (9 SRSE cases and 1 case of refractory SE [RSE]). Nine centers obtained IRB approval for retrospective chart review and completed data collection forms. A tenth case had published data from a case report that were referenced in this study. Data from the collection forms and the published case report were compiled in Excel. All 10 cases presented with focal SE: 9 with SRSE and 1 with RSE. Etiology varied from known lesion (focal cortical dysplasia in 7 cases and recurrent meningioma in 1) to unknown (2 cases, with 1 presenting with new-onset refractory focal SE [NORSE]). Seven of 10 cases exited SRSE after RNS placement and activation, with a time frame ranging from 1 to 27 days. Two patients died of complications due to ongoing SRSE. Another patient's SE never resolved but was subclinical. One of 10 cases had a device-related significant adverse event (trace hemorrhage), which did not require intervention. There was 1 reported recurrence of SE after discharge among the cases in which SRSE resolved up to the defined endpoint. This case series offers preliminary evidence that RNS is a safe and potentially effective treatment option for SRSE in patients with 1-2 well-defined seizure-onset zone(s) who meet the eligibility criteria for RNS. The unique features of RNS offer multiple benefits in the SRSE setting, including real-time electrocorticography to supplement scalp EEG for monitoring SRSE progress and response to treatment, as well as numerous stimulation options. Further research is indicated to investigate the optimal stimulation settings in this unique clinical scenario.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2023.4.JNS23367,,epilepsy; focal status epilepticus; responsive neurostimulation; super-refractory status epilepticus,Systematic Review; Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We conducted an extensive workup including lumbar puncture, blood tests, EEG serial monitoring, MRI brain, total body CT scan, and PET brain with FDG to shed light on the etiology of the disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-06106-8,PMC9064715,Antiepileptic drugs (AED); Epilepsy; FIRES; Immunoglobulin; NORSE,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
22459869,Proposition: limbic encephalitis may represent limbic status epilepticus. A review of clinical and EEG characteristics.,"Kaplan, Peter W; Rossetti, Andrea O; Kaplan, Emma H; Wieser, Heinz-Gregor",Kaplan,"Limbic encephalitis (LE) with waxing and waning neuropsychiatric manifestations including behavioral, personality, psychiatric, and memory changes can evolve over days to months. Many features of LE show remarkable overlap with the characteristics of mesial-temporal (limbic) status epilepticus (MTLSE or LSE). With LE, these prolonged impaired states are assumed not to be due to ongoing epileptic activity or MTLSE, because scalp EEGs usually show no epileptiform spike-wave activity; cycling behavioral and motor changes are attributed to LE; there may be little immediate improvement with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); and of course, implanted electrodes are rarely used. Conversely, it is known that in pre-surgical patients with refractory limbic epilepsy, implanted electrodes have revealed limbic seizures that cannot be seen at the scalp. This paper assembles a chain of inferences to advance the proposition that refractory LE might represent LSE more often than is thought, and that implanted electrodes should be considered in some cases. We present two cases that suggest that LE was also LSE, one of which warranted implanted electrodes (case 1).","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,10.1016/j.yebeh.2011.11.029,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Although medical algorithms typically are effective, when they do fail, options may be limited, and neurosurgical intervention should be considered. We report a case of SRSE treated acutely with responsive neurostimulation (RNS) and focal surgical resection after intracranial monitoring. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature for neurosurgical treatment of SRSE (e.g., neurostimulation). Only published manuscripts were considered. Our patient's seizure semiology consisted of left facial twitching with frequent evolution to bilateral tonic-clonic convulsions. Stereoelectroencephalography and grid monitoring identified multiple seizure foci. The patient underwent right RNS placement with cortical strip leads over the lateral primary motor and premotor cortex as well as simultaneous right superior temporal and frontopolar resection. Status epilepticus resolved 21 days after surgical resection and placement of the RNS. The systematic review revealed 15 case reports describing 17 patients with SRSE who underwent acute neurosurgical intervention. There were 3 patients with SRSE with RNS placement as a single modality, all of whom experienced cessation of SE. Four patients with SRSE received vagus nerve stimulation (3 as a single modality and 1 with combined corpus callosotomy), of whom 1 had SE recurrence at 2weeks. Two patients with SRSE received deep brain stimulation, and the remaining 8 underwent surgical resection; none had recurrence of SE. RNS System placement with or without resection can be a viable treatment option for select patients with SRSE. Early neurosurgical intervention may improve seizure outcomes and reduce complications.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2022.07.141,,RNS; Responsive neurostimulation; SRSE; Super-refractory status epilepticus,Systematic Review; Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

It is characterized by headache, stupor, seizures, and visual alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging findings include white matter changes preferentially in the parieto-occipital regions. Although pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, vasoconstriction and brain hypoperfusion seem to be the cause of brain ischemia and vasogenic edema. Cerebrospinal fluid hypotension is also a reported plausible pathogenic mechanism. We present a case of PRES following laminectomy and fixation for L4-5 lumbar stenosis and spondylolisthesis. The patient presented with status epilepticus immediately after surgery that lasted 5 days. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral parietal and occipital lobes and external capsules. On the basis of postoperative lumbar images, we hypothesized that an unnoticed cerebrospinal fluid leak might have contributed to development of PRES. The patient developed multiple postoperative complications but ultimately recovered after treatment for severe hypertension and seizures. Prompt recognition and treatment of this potentially life-threatening syndrome is necessary to increase the likelihood of favorable outcome. Spinal surgeons need to be aware of the possibility of neurologic deterioration after spinal surgery and be alert about the occurrence of a dural leak, either recognized or unnoticed, as the plausible mechanism triggering PRES.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.05.174,,Dural leak; Laminectomy; Lumbar stenosis; Lumbar surgery; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

7827478,Status epilepticus. A perspective from the neuroscience intensive care unit.,"Jordan, K G",Jordan,"Patients with GCSE and NCSE are common and may present to the emergency department or the NICU. In the NICU, NCSE is a more common presentation than GCSE. In the emergency department, GCSE commonly evolves to NCSE, either as a late sequela of prolonged SE or due to partial treatment with antiepileptic medication or neuromuscular blocking agents. In the emergency department, acute cerebral injuries are commonly found in patients presenting with SE, regardless of whether they have preexisting epilepsy. In the NICU, almost by definition, SE occurs in patients with acute cerebral injuries. Status epilepticus has been found to evolve sequentially through several stages, the end-point of which is a condition of refractory SE leading to neuronal necrosis and permanent cerebral injury. The responsiveness of SE to treatment is time-dependent. This makes early diagnosis and initiation of treatment essential. Most published treatment algorithms stress a 60-minute time window from the diagnosis of SE to its successful control. Unfortunately, the practical problem of patients with SE accessing such treatment protocols has been overlooked. Our preliminary (unpublished) data suggest that this access problem must be solved for treatment algorithms to improve the outcome of SE. In the NICU, access is less of a problem, and the determining factor is early diagnosis by NICU personnel. Because these patients usually sustain NCSE, which can be difficult to diagnose, a high index of suspicion and, optimally, continuous EEG monitoring are necessary for early diagnosis. NICU patients may be more susceptible to the ravages of SE because of their preexisting cerebral injuries. Expedited treatment may therefore be more important in this patient group. Clinical management of SE requires meticulous attention to ventilation and oxygenation, maintenance of adequate blood pressure, prevention of hyperthermia, and close monitoring for cardiac abnormalities. No specific medication is ideal for controlling SE. The knowledgeable and prompt use of intravenous lorazepam, a diazepam-phenytoin combination, or phenobarbital is acceptable as first-line treatment and as part of a systematic treatment algorithm. Refractory SE has been treated conventionally with high-dose intravenous barbiturate coma. Recent evidence suggests that high-dose intravenous midazolam may provide a useful alternative.",{},,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

To systematically review cases describing surgery for the treatment of severe HSVE. We also present an illustrative case of anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) for refractory status epilepticus in a patient with unilateral HSVE. This case demonstrates one clinical context in which surgery can be a useful adjunct. We performed a systematic review using PubMed and Google Scholar, including case reports and series describing surgical interventions for HSVE. Clinical data were extracted from 54 publications that incorporated 67 patient cases. Surgical decompression occurred at a wide range of times after the onset of illness, although most patients were operated on 4 or more days after HSVE symptoms began. Numerous reports indicated that decompressive craniectomy, temporal lobectomy, and hematoma removal could treat intractably elevated intracranial pressure because of HSVE with favorable long-term outcomes. We describe an additional case in which a 52-year-old woman with HSVE developed refractory right temporal lobe seizures. After ATL, the seizures resolved with significant clinical improvement. Surgical treatment can be a useful adjunct for treatment of HSVE. There is substantial variability in the timing of surgical decompression in patients with HSVE, which can be necessary up to approximately 3 weeks after illness onset. ATL should be considered for refractory status epilepticus in HSVE with a unilateral seizure focus.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neurosurgery,10.1227/neu.0000000000002334,,,Systematic Review; Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

NCSE was suspected to be attributed to Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity. The patient's main risk factors were decreased renal clearance and incorrect dosing. Conslusion: Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity should be suspected in patients who developed neurologic symptoms after the administration of Cefepime. Emergent image study for excluding more commonly seen or critical etiologies and further evaluation with EEG were necessary. For those patients who have risk factors for Cefepime neurotoxicity, such as ESRD, TDM (therapeutic drug monitoring) may be useful in providing close monitoring and preventing adverse effects associated with Cefepime treatment.

The most common identifiable cause is inflammatory-autoimmune. Consequently, we present a case of NOSRSE related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as an opportunity to investigate the dysimmune origin of this pathology. We report the case of a 40-year-old male who presented at the emergency department with fever and headache with no clear source of infection. His personal history included bacterial meningitis in childhood without any sequelae and protein S deficiency without treatment at the time, as well as vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 21 days earlier. He was initially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with cefuroxime. Two days later, he was taken back to the emergency department with confusional symptoms and tonic-clonic seizures. He did not respond to midazolam and finally required sedation and orotracheal intubation for refractory status epilepticus. While in hospital, he required a number of lines of antiepileptic drugs, ketamine, a ketogenic diet, immunotherapy and plasmapheresis in order to successfully limit NOSRSE. The aetiological study offered normal results for serology, antineuronal antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, transthoracic echocardiography, testicular ultrasound and computed tomographic angiography.

The diagnosis was made in patients with confirmed COVID-19 who presented with new-onset cognitive disturbances, central focal neurological signs, or seizures. All patients underwent cognitive screening, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture, and brain 2-desoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (FDG-PET/CT). The four patients were aged 60 years or older, and presented with various degrees of cognitive impairment, with predominant frontal lobe impairment. Two patients presented with cerebellar syndrome, one patient had myoclonus, one had psychiatric manifestations, and one had status epilepticus. The delay between first COVID-19 symptoms and onset of neurological symptoms was between 0 and 12 days. None of the patients had MRI features of encephalitis nor significant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. All patients presented with a consistent brain FDG-PET/CT pattern of abnormalities, namely frontal hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. All patients improved after immunotherapy.

We present a case of ICH associated with CVST in which heparin treatment was associated with rebleeding, and we review current evidence of anticoagulation safety in patients with ICH associated with CVST. A 65-year-old man presented with right hemiparesis and loss of consciousness. Brain computed tomography showed a left frontoparietal hemorrhage. Angiographic studies with magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a partial superior saggital sinus thrombosis. With a diagnosis of CVST, intravenous heparin was administered. After 24 hours the patient had a symptomatic increase in ICH size, and 2 days later the patient developed a status epilepticus with new evidence of rebleeding. Anticoagulant treatment was stopped and the patient experienced neurological improvement, with no new episodes of rebleeding. Evidence for the safety of anticoagulants in CVST comes from 2 small trials involving a total of 79 patients, but only 18 had some degree of bleeding in baseline computed tomography. A meta-analysis suggested that in CVST patients who are treated with anticoagulants, the risk of ICH is low, but acknowledged that an impact of up to 9% of new ICH cannot be ruled out. As there is not enough evidence for the safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with early ICH associated with CVST, the therapeutic decision must be individualized and the rebleeding risk should be weighed in those patients.",{},,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0b013e31821a259b,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Dysregulated immune responses are considered to be mediating such complications. Our case illustrates multiple critical neurological complications simultaneously developed in a patient with non-severe COVID-19 and successful recovery with a multifaceted therapeutic approach. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was temporally correlated with the clinical severity of the status epilepticus in our patient, suggesting a causal relationship. A previously healthy 20-year-old female patient presented with a first-onset seizure. Concomitant non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed. CSF study showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IL-6 levels in CSF. During hospitalization under the diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis, status epilepticus developed, and the seizure frequency was temporally correlated with the CSF IL-6 level. Furthermore, a new embolic stroke developed without a significant cardioembolic source. Contrary to the exacerbated COVID-19-associated neurological complications, COVID-19 pneumonia was cleared entirely. After treatment with antiseizure medications, antithrombotics, antiviral agents, and immunotherapy, the patient was discharged with near-complete recovery.

In dogs it has been associated with protozoal infections, cuterebral myiasis and various other aetiologies. Ten cases of idiopathic eosinophilic meningoencephalitis have been reported in dogs and one in a cat where the origin was uncertain or unknown. The dogs were all males, of various breeds but with a predominance of Golden Retrievers and Rottweilers; they generally had a young age of onset. Two cases with no apparent underlying aetiology were diagnosed on post mortem examination. The 18-month-old, male Boerboel presented with sudden onset of cerebellar ataxia, as well as various asymmetrical cranial nerve deficits of 2 weeks' duration and without progression. Haematology revealed a peripheral eosinophilia. Necropsy showed extreme generalised congestion especially of the meninges and blood smear and histological sections of various tissues showed intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation with the formation of microcytes. Histopathology revealed severe diffuse cerebrocortical subarachnoidal meningitis and submeningeal encephalitis, the exudate containing variable numbers of eosinophils together with neutrophils and mononuclear cells. There was also deeper white matter and hippocampal multifocal perivascular mononuclear encephalitis and multifocal periventricular malacia, gliosis and phagocytosis of white matter. The cerebellum, brain stem and spinal c showed only mild multifocal oedema or scattered occasional axon and myelin degeneration respectively, with no inflammation. Immunohistochemical staining of central nervous tissue for Toxoplasma gondii failed to show any antigen in the central nervous tissue. Ultrastructure of a single submeningeal suspected parasitic cyst showed it to be chromatin clumping within a neuron nucleus indicating karyorrhexis. Gram stain provided no evidence of an aetiological agent. The 3-year-old Beagle bitch had a Caesarian section after developing a non-responsive inertia 8 days prior to presentation. This animal's clinical signs included status epilepticus seizures unrelated to hypocalcaemia and warranted induction of a barbiturate coma. She died 4 hours later. Post mortem and histopathological findings in the brain were almost identical to those of the Boerboel and she also showed histological evidence of recent active intravascular haemolysis with microcyte formation. Rabies, distemper and Neospora caninum immunohistochemical stains were negative in the brains of both dogs. Immunohistochemical staining of the cerebral and meningeal exudates of the Beagle for T- and B-lymphocyte (CD3 and CD79a) markers showed a predominance of T-lymphocytes with fewer scattered B lymphocytes. A possible allergic response to amoxicillin/clavulanate is considered, as this appeared to be the only feature common to the recent history of both animals.

We present a 54-year-old man found unresponsive with a right hemispheric syndrome several days after discharge following amygdalohippocampectomy for refractory right temporal lobe epilepsy. Prolonged electroencephalogram demonstrated one subclinical right frontal seizure, along with right frontal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, presumed to be associated with SE preceding his admission. Initial MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion on diffusion weighted imaging in the right cerebral hemisphere, ipsilateral thalamus, and contralateral cerebellum. A head CT one week later showed diffuse sulcal effacement with loss of gray-white differentiation in the right frontal and insular regions with low attenuation changes of right thalamus. An MRI showed worsened diffusion restriction, despite a corresponding increase in perfusion. The patient remained paretic at discharge and follow-up. Follow-up MRI at 2 months demonstrated pronounced right cerebral and left cerebellar atrophy, loss of gray matter in much of the right cerebrum, and scattered areas of T2 hyperintensity, consistent with permanent right fronto-temporal neuronal loss. Collectively, these observations indicate that imaging findings of persistent cerebral restricted diffusion and cytotoxic edema in the subacute post-ictal period may predict irreversible neuronal injury and poor long-term outcome-even when accompanied by evidence of cortical hyperperfusion and recovery of second- and third-order neurons along the involved circuit.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-015-0155-4,,Deafferentation; Excitotoxic injury; Hyperactivation; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Acquired hyperekplexia is usually seen in brainstem pathologies and when it develops acutely it can be easily misdiagnosed as a convulsive seizure. A 38-year-old man presented with acute onset generalized brief involuntary jerky movements and a decreased level of consciousness. He was initially diagnosed with convulsive status epilepticus for which he received multiple antiseizure medications without any improvement. Further investigations revealed abnormal oculocephalic reflex response and that his movements were in fact hyperkeplexia caused by brainstem infarction with basilar artery thrombus secondary to right vertebral artery dissection. Emergent thrombectomy was performed and he was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should be aware of hyperekplexia and how to differentiate it from convulsive stats epilepticus because the pathology and the emergent treatment of these 2 serious conditions are different. An underlying acquired brainstem pathology (especially basilar artery thromboembolism) should be suspected in any patient with untypical convulsive like movements along with focal neurologic signs compatible with brain stem pathology even when computed tomography imaging is normal. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.,"DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.04.038,,acquired hyperekplexia; basilar artery thromboembolism; brainstem; convulsions; epilepsy; hyperekplexia; infarction; rostral brain stem infarction; startle syndromes; top of the basilar syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe clinical, EEG, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging findings of a confirmed case of sCJD with tau pathology, initially diagnosed as NCSE. We performed a literature review in PubMed of previous publications on both sCJD and NCSE. An 82-year-old woman with no medical history presented with a 2-week rapidly progressive neurological disorder, with motor aphasia, myoclonus, pyramidalism, and left posterior alien hand. EEG showed periodic sharp waves on right frontal regions, so anti-epileptic treatment was started. CSF results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated hyperintensity of the right cerebral cortex in diffusion sequences. Due to suspected new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), corticosteroid treatment was started, without clinical improvement. Necropsy results confirmed sCJD with tau pathology. The literature review identified 14 references including a total of 18 cases with NCSE as the presenting symptom of sCJD; the clinical and results in complementary tests were compiled into a table. Sporadic CJD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapid cognitive decline and EEG changes consistent with NCSE. The wide heterogeneity in the etiology of NCSE, including autoimmune disorders, especially NORSE, suggests immunotherapy should be initiated based on a good risk-benefit balance. Some cases of sCJD, such as the present case with tau pathology, may mimic this clinico-electrical course.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,European journal of neurology,10.1111/ene.14624,,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; non-convulsive; periodic sharp wave complexes; status epilepticus; tau,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Two consecutive cases are presented of patients manifesting focal status epilepticus secondary to IHCP, with clinical, laboratory [blood test and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis], neuroradiologic [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla and digital subtraction angiography (DSA)], and therapeutic data. One patient underwent meningeal biopsy; pathology findings are also included. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in clinical improvement in both cases, and neuroimaging showed decreased abnormal morphology, compared to initial findings.

We present a patient with recurrent presentations with focal SE, aphasia and other focal deficits of cortical function and ictal and peri-ictal LPDs on serial EEG, who was shown to have a left hemispheric dAVF associated with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Seizures proved refractory to four anti-seizure medications but became more amenable to control after successful embolisation of the dAVF, with subsequent resolution of the focal cortical deficits. We discuss the co-occurrence of SE and LPDs with dAVF and review previously reported cases with this rare association. Our report supports a causative relationship between dAVF and focal SE, manifesting as ictal LPDs on EEG, and highlights the importance of active dAVF management in achieving seizure control. The relatively good patient outcome contrasts to the few similar case reports. Whilst rare, it is important to consider dAVF as a potentially treatable condition underlying new-onset seizures, including SE.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-024-07325-x,PMC10943149,Aphasia; Dural arteriovenous fistula; Lateralised periodic discharges; Seizures; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

She had bronchial asthma, was previously diagnosed with cerebral infarction, had experienced two events of convulsive status epilepticus, and was undergoing treatment with theophylline, levetiracetam, and clopidogrel. Head diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high-signal area in the left crus posterior capsula interna. For this, we administered cilostazol along with her regular medicines. On day 14, she had tonic-clonic convulsions, extending from the right upper and lower limbs to the whole body. Subsequently, cilostazol was discontinued, and the dose of levetiracetam was increased. However, she developed severe tonic-clonic seizures with right sensory aphasia and right hemiplegia, for which an increased dose of lacosamide was added. When theophylline was discontinued 5 days after the onset of convulsions, the blood concentration of theophylline was 9.7μg/mL. After theophylline was discontinued, tonic-clonic convulsions improved. The disturbance of consciousness and right hemiparesis were improved after one week, while the disturbance of sensory aphasia was improved after one month.

To the best of our knowledge, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and neuropathological features of the first case of super-refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus (sr-NCSE) secondary to fat embolism. An 82-year-old woman was transferred to our intensive care unit because of a sudden decrease of consciousness level, right hemiparesis, and acute respiratory failure in the early postoperative period of knee prosthesis surgery. Brain computed tomography (TC) including angio-CT and CT perfusion was normal. An urgent video-electroencephalography (v-EEG) evaluation showed continuous sharp-and slow-wave at 2.0-2.5 Hz in keeping with the diagnosis of generalized NCSE. Epileptiform discharges ceased after the administration of 5mg of intravenous diazepam, and background activity constituted by diffuse theta waves was observed without clinical improvement. Treatment with levetiracetam (1000 mg/day) and sedation with propofol and midazolam were initiated. Moreover, continuous v-EEG monitoring was also started. Despite antiepileptic therapy, epileptiform activity recurred after the interruption of profound sedation, and valproate and lacosamide were added during the ensuing days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed small scattered foci of acute ischemic infarcts and diffuse petechiae involving the basal ganglia and pons and centrum semiovale in keeping with fat embolism. Super-refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained without control for 2 weeks. Finally, the patient died. The clinical autopsy revealed a bilateral lung fat embolism associated with a hemorrhagic infarction in the left lower lobe. Fatty lesions were also seen in the intestine and pancreas. Scattered microscopic cerebral infarcts associated with fat emboli in the capillaries were noticed, affecting both supra- and infratentorial structures. In addition, occasional focal areas of ischemic injury showing filiform neurons with reactive astrocytic gliosis background consistent with acute lesions were observed in CA3.

Even though many cases are spontaneous, the incidence of intracranial hypotension in the neurocritical care setting is increasing by virtue of the increased number of neurosurgical interventions. Whether spontaneous or secondary in etiology, diagnosis of IH usually requires the presence of orthostatic symptoms, including headaches and nausea with low opening CSF pressure. However, typical clinical features in the appropriate clinical context and imaging, even with normal CSF pressure, can indicate IH. In the neurocritical care setting, challenges for accurate semiology include altered sensorium and reduced levels of responsiveness for which many etiologies may exist, including metabolic dysfunction, traumatic brain injury, IH, or nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). The authors describe 3 patients whose clinical picture and electroencephalography (EEG) findings initially suggested NCSE but who did not respond to treatment with antiepileptic drugs alone. Neuroimaging suggested IH, and subsequent treatment of IH successfully improved the patient's clinical status. To the authors' knowledge this paper is the first in the literature that reports a correlation of IH with electrographic findings similar to NCSE as cause and effect. The authors' hypothesis is that thalamocortical dysfunction causes EEG findings that appear to be similar to those in NCSE but that these conditions do not coexist. The EEG activity is not epileptogenic, and IH results in blocking network pathways producing thalamocortical dysfunction. The authors discuss the hypothesis and pathophysiology of these epileptiform changes in relation to IH.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2013.7.JNS112308,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although most cases are associated with organic brain lesions, nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH)-related aphasic status epilepticus is rare, especially if it is isolated (without other clinical seizure activity). On the other hand, unlike other metabolic disorders, or hypoglycemia-related generalized seizures, focal motor seizure and epilepsia partialis continua can occur in 25% of NKH, with seizures being the initial manifestation in up to 50% of patients. However, the presentation of epileptic aphasia is rare in NKH patients. We report a rare case of NKH presenting initially as persistent and isolated aphasic status epilepticus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any focal lesion, but ictal electroencephalography (EEG) disclosed left frontotemporal continuous theta to delta waves, intermingled with epileptiform discharges. Correcting the hyperglycemia failed to improve the language disorder, and the seizure was controlled only by the addition of carbamazepine. Patients with NKH may initially present with isolated aphasic status epilepticus. Unlike stroke-related aphasia, accurate diagnosis is difficult if based solely on neurologic examination and brain neuroimaging. Use of EEG and blood sugar determination should be helpful in this special condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059413490930,,aphasic status epilepticus; carbamazepine; nonketotic hyperglycemia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We retrospectively studied eight patients with ASE confirmed by ictal-EEG, who underwent ictal-MRI shortly after well-documented onset (mean time delay 3 h). ASE consisted in fluctuating aphasia, mostly associated with other subtle contralateral neurological signs such as hemiparesia, hemianopia, or slight clonic jerks. In MRI, six patients showed cortical temporoparietal hyperintensity in DWI and four of them had also ipsilateral pulvinar lesions. Five patients showed close spatial hyperperfusion areas matching the DWI lesions and an enhanced blow flow in the middle cerebral artery. Parenchymal lesions and hemodynamic abnormalities were not associated with seizure duration or severity in any case. The resolution of DWI lesions at follow-up MRI depended on the length of the MRIs interval.

EEG often reveals periodic discharges and spikes, but SESA presenting with non-convulsive status epilepticus has rarely been described. We report a case of SESA with non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient who was initially suspected of having a typical alcohol withdrawal seizure. A 61 year old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted at an outside hospital for confusion thought to be secondary to an alcohol withdrawal seizure. She had right hemiparesis and later developed right facial twitching that did not respond to intravenous fosphenytoin and levetiracetam. She was transferred for further management. Upon arrival, lorazepam and fosphenytoin were given and right face clonic movements resolved. However, continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Following treatment with IV valproate and lacosamide, there was resolution of NCSE. SESA is likely an under recognized clinical syndrome that is quite distinct from typical alcohol withdrawal seizures and requires a different diagnostic and management approach. NCSE is likely to account for the encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits seen in patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SESA. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is warranted and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for alcoholic patients with encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2011.02.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the neurology department after complaining of an inability to see in the right eye for 2 days and progressive headache. He had a history of poststroke epilepsy and vascular dementia. Physical examination revealed right visual field hemianopia, visual neglect and cognitive impairment.

Electroencephalography monitoring was performed, which found continuous sharp wave discharges, especially in the regions of the left temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. These findings were most consistent with the diagnosis of NCSE. Thus, a treatment of intravenous pumping of diazepam and an oral antiepileptic drug was added immediately. After that, the visual loss in the patient recovered quickly, and electroencephalography did not find epileptiform waves.

EEG evidence of focal status may take several forms, and their interpretation is controversial. We detailed the clinical spectrum of focal status in patients diagnosed by both clinical deficit and EEG criteria and contrasted clinical manifestations in patients with different EEG patterns. Patients were diagnosed with a neurologic deficit and discrete recurrent focal electrographic seizures or rapid, continuous focal epileptiform discharges on EEG. Clinical findings were determined by chart review. Of 41 patients with focal status, acute vascular disease was the cause in 21; 10 of 41 had exacerbations of prior epilepsy. A variety of clinical seizure types occurred, both before and after the EEG diagnosis, but the diagnosis was not expected in 28 patients before the EEG. Three had no obvious clinical seizures. Focal motor seizures and an abnormal mental status were the most common manifestations at the time of the EEG. With antiepileptic drugs, almost all had control of clinical seizures, and most improved in mental status. Patients with rapid continuous focal epileptiform discharges were nearly identical in presentation, likelihood of diagnosis, subsequent seizures, response to medication, and outcome to those with discrete seizures on EEG. Focal status epilepticus may be seen with a wide variety of clinical seizure types or without obvious clinical seizures. The diagnosis is often delayed or missed and should be considered after strokes or clinical seizures when patients do not stabilize or improve as expected. The diagnosis should be made equally whether patients have discrete electrographic seizures or continuous rapid focal epileptiform discharges on the EEG, and the same response to medications and outcome should be anticipated for the two groups.",{},,Epilepsia,10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00855.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Among a total of 22 patients who underwent STA-MCA anastomosis over a course of 4 years, 3 patients were diagnosed with CHS based on clinical symptoms and neuroradiological examinations, including cerebral blood flow evaluation. Case 1 and Case 2 developed CHS on postoperative day 1, when EEG demonstrated focal slow waves on the frontal region of the operated side, indicating cortical dysfunction in these areas. Although prompt recovery of these EEG findings was noted with improvement of the clinical symptoms in Case 1, Case 2 developed an intracranial hemorrhage on postoperative day 5, when EEG clearly depicted persistent nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) after control of convulsive status epilepticus. In contrast, the clinical onset in Case 3 was delayed to postoperative day 6 and EEG revealed frequent ictal discharges in the operated hemisphere, although convulsive seizures were not apparent. Administration of anticonvulsants was performed after the diagnosis of NCSE, and complete recovery from CHS was achieved. Although the pathophysiology of CHS is cortical dysfunction, ictal hyperperfusion associated with NCSE could be included. The present findings emphasize the importance of repeated EEG examinations in the differential diagnosis of the various types of pathophysiological conditions of CHS.",{},,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.53.388,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

Case series. Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, California, and the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center. One patient with a single remote seizure and 2 patients with symptomatic partial epilepsy all presented with homonymous hemianopsia. Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging, and antiepileptic medical therapy for status epilepticus. Neurologic examination, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The association of homonymous hemianopsia and restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging led to an initial diagnosis of ischemic infarction in 2 cases despite atypical diffusion-weighted imaging patterns. However, continuous electroencephalogram demonstrated focal epileptiform discharges in 2 cases and repetitive focal seizures in another, suggesting a diagnosis of status epilepticus amauroticus. Homonymous hemianopsia resolved in all 3 patients after escalation of the dosage of anticonvulsant therapy. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram demonstrated complete or near-complete resolution of associated abnormalities. Status epilepticus amauroticus is an uncommon but important cause of homonymous hemianopsia, and it should be considered in any patient with a history of seizures, fluctuating visual symptoms, or atypical patterns of restricted diffusion involving the occipital cortex. Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring is an important diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of status epilepticus amauroticus, which may have a favorable prognosis when treated with aggressive anticonvulsant therapy.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneurol.2012.317,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

So far, newer antiepileptic drugs (AED) have not assumed a noticeable role in the treatment of SE. This may be in part due to the lack of IV forms for the newer AEDs. The IV form of Levetiracetam (IV-LEV) has recently become available and has a potential role in the treatment of SE. We report two cases of non-convulsive SE that responded favorably to IV-LEV. The first patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of complex partial seizure disorder who presented with impaired consciousness. The second patient is an 82-year-old male with history of old left middle cerebral artery ischemic infarction, who presented with confusion. Both patients were found to have a non-convulsive status epilepticus on electroencephalography (EEG) and treated with IV-LEV.

Clinical symptoms and lesions on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often disappear in 1 week or a few weeks. However, MERS manifesting as a severe clinical course with significant sequela has not yet been reported. A 42-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of headache, fever, and irrational speech. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.5°C, dysarthria, dyscalculia, recent memory disturbance, and otherwise normal vital signs. The patient developed status epilepticus and progressive consciousness disturbance. MRI showed abnormal patchy signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The clinical feature and the characteristic of MRI are mostly consistent with MERS. At the same time, we made a differential diagnosis by testing the NMDARAb, AMPA1Ab, AMPA2Ab, LG1Ab, CASPR2Ab, GABABRAb in CSF and serum. The subject was treated with ganciclovir, antiepileptic, and antipyretic therapy. The subject was living a virtually normal life with persistent mild memory disturbance. MRI showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared, but hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging was noted in the centrum semiovale.

Both hyperkalemia and coronary occlusion were ruled out. Within a few hours, the ECG spontaneously normalized.

All investigations, including the most common antibodies related to immune-mediated encephalitis were negative. Seizures continued despite several therapeutic trials with anesthetics (midazolam, propofol) and antiepileptic agents as well as i.v. immunoglobulins but responded, at day 10 from the onset, to ketamine and high dose i.v. steroids. Due the high suspicion of autoimmune encephalitis we tested patient's CSF and plasma on mouse brain with positive response. We subsequently detected a high titre of GABA<sub>A</sub>R antibodies. After the resolution of the status epilepticus the patient achieved complete recovery of neurological functions. this is the first reported case of a FIRES-like condition due to autoimmune encephalitis mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub>R antibodies.

Right hemiparesis developed the next day with persistent headache and the patient was sent back to the Neurology Clinic where he developed myoclonic seizures compatible with focal motor status epilepticus. Neuroimaging, performed two days later, revealed a huge hemorrhagic venous infarcts in the left posterior cerebral hemisphere associated with typical signs of dural sinus thrombosis. Subtle curvilinear hyperdensities were detected within the left parietal cortico-subcortical border zone on reevaluation of the initial brain CT. A posteriori these were thought to be compatible with a developing venous infarct, associated with subtle signs most consistent with combined cortical vein and sinus thrombosis.

We review the clinical, radiologic, neurophysiologic, investigational and neuropathological findings on a 27 year old woman who died after 162 days of prolonged refractory status epilepticus. Continuous EEG monitoring confirmed recurrent uncontrolled seizure activity bilaterally and independently, most frequent in the right fronto-temporal region. Initial MRI of the brain was normal. Repeat study until on day 127 of admission showed advanced changes, with bilateral pulvinar T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. The autopsy revealed sharply defined, grey, soft, granular nodules in each medial pulvinar nucleus. Microscopically these consisted of sharply defined paucicellular areas with loss of neurons and myelin and with numerous macrophages in their centers, surrounded by reactive astrocytes with relatively spared of axons. The spinal cord at cervical and thoracic levels showed symmetric spongy vacuolation in the central part of the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts, with mild myelin loss, relatively preserved axons. The pathological lesions found in this case in thepulvinar are somewhat similar to the pathologic lesions described in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Those found in the spinal cord of our patient resemble characteristic features of B12 related subacute combined degeneration. Characteristic pulvinar degeneration may be found as an acquired phenomenon in prolonged refractory status epilepticus.

We report the case of a 48-year-old female, who presented with a series of status epilepticus. The only positive result of the initial exploration was an increased level of antithyroid antibodies. The patient's condition improved only after initiation of corticosteroid treatment, which provided a stable remission. HE pathophysiology still remains poorly understood and controversial. Pathological data are sparse and provide variable pictures. Although an autoimmune mechanism looks very likely, the precise role of antithyroid antibodies is still discussed. A direct toxicity has not been demonstrated and antibodies could simply be a marker of impaired immunity. Occurrence of status epilepticus in HE could be related to the presence of active inflammation of cortical or para-cortical tissue, although such a hypothesis remains to be demonstrated. The diagnosis of HE should be systematically considered in patients with unexplained episodes of status epilepticus.

During the course of the disease, some specific EEG patterns have been described: generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA) and extreme delta brush (EDB). In comatose patients, the association of these EEG abnormalities with subtle motor manifestations can suggest ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). We report the case of a 28-year-old woman admitted for a clinical presentation typical of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis, which was confirmed by CSF analysis. She was rapidly intubated because of severe dysautonomia and disturbed consciousness. Clinical examination revealed subtle paroxysmal and intermittent myoclonic and tonic movements, correlated on video-EEG with GRDA and/or EDB. NCSE was then suspected, but electroclinical manifestations persisted despite many anti-epileptic drugs combinations, or reappeared when barbiturate anesthesia was decreased. In order to confirm or dismiss the diagnosis, intracranial pressure (ICP) and surface video-EEG monitoring were performed simultaneously and revealed no ICP increase, thus being strongly against a diagnosis of seizures.

Ten days after giving birth, the patient presented a clinical picture consisting in headache, epileptic seizures, blindness and deterioration of the level of consciousness. The magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed the predominant involvement of posterior white matter. Although eclampsia is a typical condition in pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, it must be remembered that there is also a late-onset form that may occur after the birth and might be the cause of other syndromes such as PRES. Although the prognosis in these cases is usually favourable, treatment must be established as early as possible, with rapid control of the blood pressure and seizures in order to avoid permanent brain damage.

NCSE poses great diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to the lack of typical symptoms. Here, we report a case of NCSE manifesting as rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Additionally, the relevant literature was reviewed. A 63-year-old man presented with RPD. Electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed NCSE, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an isolated infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Mini-mental state examination showed moderate cognitive impairment (14/30 points). A diagnosis of NCSE with RPD and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum was made. The patient was treated with intravenous diazepam (10 mg), oral levetiracetam (1.0g twice daily), oral sodium valproate (0.2g twice daily), and intramuscular phenobarbital sodium (0.2g once daily). After the treatment, the symptoms were improved. The patient could answer questions. Repeated EEG showed that the background a rhythm was slightly overdeveloped, and no clinical or electrical seizures were observed. After discharge, the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam (1.0g twice daily) and oral sodium valproate (0.2g twice daily) for 6 months. At the last follow-up, the patient had clear consciousness, sensitive response, and fluent answering ability. Repeated mini-mental state examination showed that his cognitive function was significantly improved (28/30 points); nevertheless, the lesion in the splenium of corpus callosum remained unchanged on MRI. NCSE manifesting as RPD and infarction in the splenium of the corpus callosum is extremely rare. Epileptic events and focal infarction are usually overlooked in patients with dementia, and the diagnostic value of MRI and EEG should be highlighted.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000025263,PMC8051981,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This finding is generally detected after ischemic stroke, but can also be observed during status epilepticus. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman with a history of focal epilepsy and alcohol abuse presented with an episode of seizure with initial stroke-mimicking changes and no epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram. Upon further examination, the radiological findings revealed a broad cytotoxic edema in the left hemisphere and a smaller lesion in the right cerebellum, showing a rare phenomenon of crossed cerebellar diaschisis. Later, diagnosis of status epilepticus was established. Although the initial trend of the patient's condition was negative, after weeks of therapy and intensive care, the patient slightly improved in her condition and there was a partially reversible lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere and right cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial to detect seizures in patients with stroke-like changes on unenhanced computed tomography examination, and especially in cases in which there are no arterial occlusion on computed tomography angiography and asymmetric arterial vasodilatation are seen. Status epilepticus can mimic stroke, establishing this as a major diagnostic challenge. Although the radiological findings in the left cerebral hemisphere lesion and the right cerebellar hemisphere were similar, its characteristics on diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient value differed, raising an important question of the exact mechanics of how crossed cerebellar diaschisis occurs, as it seems to be a rare phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942715,PMC10806372,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The clinical picture was confused with eclampsia because of rising blood pressure and proteinuria. Clinical investigations, which included a lumbar puncture, were carried out to rule out an infective cause for the seizures. A computed tomography of the brain was performed for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. The patient was intubated and ventilated in the intensive care unit. The labile blood pressure settled in 2 days, and the transient heavy proteinuria also resolved after 3 days. Eclampsia would have warranted operative delivery of the preterm fetus with the attendant problems of prematurity. Delivery would have been hazardous in such an acutely unwell patient. The management also would have required magnesium sulfate with its potential for toxicity. Transient proteinuria may occur in status epilepticus. The blood pressure can be labile during epileptic seizures and, in the absence of an intracranial hemorrhage, generally settles without treatment after control of the seizures. This case highlights the importance of differentiating eclampsia in a patient with known epilepsy that may also mask other disease entities such as intracranial hemorrhage, meningitis, or encephalopathy. We have also discussed the importance of various signs associated with eclampsia and their clinical significance. The differential diagnosis of seizures in pregnancy are broad as symptoms of the various disease entities including eclampsia, intracranial hemorrhage, status epilepticus, meningitis, stroke overlap creating a dilemma in an acute emergency.

Upon his long-term, 18-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated improvements in his daily living abilities, despite the persistence of bilateral temporal deficits. This report provides evidence that theophylline has the potential to provoke permanent seizure-induced neural damage, presumably via inhibition of adenosine receptors, and especially in vulnerable regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2010.11.017,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng
26044094,De novo status epilepticus with isolated aphasia.,"Flügel, Dominique; Kim, Olaf Chan-Hi; Felbecker, Ansgar; Tettenborn, Barbara",Flügel,"Sudden onset of aphasia is usually due to stroke. Rapid diagnostic workup is necessary if reperfusion therapy is considered. Ictal aphasia is a rare condition but has to be excluded. Perfusion imaging may differentiate acute ischemia from other causes. In dubious cases, EEG is required but is time-consuming and laborious. We report a case where we considered de novo status epilepticus as a cause of aphasia without any lesion even at follow-up. A 62-year-old right-handed woman presented to the emergency department after nurses found her aphasic. She had undergone operative treatment of varicosis 3 days earlier. Apart from hypertension and obesity, no cardiovascular risk factors and no intake of medication other than paracetamol were reported. Neurological examination revealed global aphasia and right pronation in the upper extremity position test. Computed tomography with angiography and perfusion showed no abnormalities. Electroencephalogram performed after the CT scan showed left-sided slowing with high-voltage rhythmic 2/s delta waves but no clear ictal pattern. Intravenous lorazepam did improve EEG slightly, while aphasia did not change. Lumbar puncture was performed which likely excluded encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cortical pathological diffusion imaging (restriction) and cortical hyperperfusion in the left parietal region. Intravenous anticonvulsant therapy under continuous EEG resolved neurological symptoms. The patient was kept on anticonvulsant therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging after 6 months showed no abnormalities along with no clinical abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were only subtle, and EEG was without clear ictal pattern, so the diagnosis of aphasic status remains with some uncertainty. However, status epilepticus can mimic stroke symptoms and has to be considered in patients with aphasia even when no previous stroke or structural lesions are detectable and EEG shows no epileptic discharges. Epileptic origin is favored when CT or MR imaging reveal no hypoperfusion. In this case, MRI was superior to CT in detecting hyperperfusion.

14684352,MRI evidence for the involvement of basal ganglia in epileptic seizures: an hypothesis.,"Dematteis, Maurice; Kahane, Philippe; Vercueil, Laurent; Depaulis, Antoine",Dematteis,"Recent clinical and experimental studies have suggested that the basal ganglia are involved in epileptic seizures as a propagation pathway or as a remote inhibitory control circuit. The present case report may provide additional evidence from post-ictal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supporting this hypothesis. A healthy 13 year-old boy was admitted for a complex partial status epilepticus. MRI, performed one week later, revealed bilateral T2 hyperintense signals in the striata and a left temporal arachnoid cyst. Left temporal slow waves were noted on EEG recording. No obvious metabolic alterations were identified. During the next six years of follow-up, no seizure occurred and striatal alterations progressively disappeared. The clinical characteristics of the seizures, EEG slow waves, and probably the presence of an arachnoid cyst suggest that seizures originated from the left temporal lobe. The long-lasting MRI changes suggest that bilateral striatal alterations may have been secondary to an inflammatory process, which in turn could have disrupted a striatal inhibitory control over seizures. On the basis of these arguments, we speculate involvement of basal ganglia in epileptic seizures, as a part of a modulatory control system over seizures rather than a propagation pathway. Future reports will support or invalidate our hypothesis.",{},,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

General anesthesia is often required to terminate refractory status epilepticus. The immunologic mechanisms leading to antibody formation remain to be elucidated. Described triggers of anti-GABA-A autoimmunity are tumors, mainly thymomas, and herpes simplex encephalitis. We present a young woman with prediagnosis of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), treated with interferons, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab. Six months after one and only cycle of alemtuzumab, speech arrest and behavioral changes with aggressive and anxious traits appeared. She showed increasing motor convulsions resulting in focal status epilepticus. Anti-GABA-A receptor antibodies in CSF and serum were confirmed in different external laboratories, in a more extensive analysis after antibodies against NMDAR, CASPR2, LGI1, GABABR, and AMPAR were ruled out during in-house examination. Clinical condition improved temporarily with cortisone therapy, plasmapheresis, and IVIG but deteriorated rapidly after steroid discontinuation, resulting in brain biopsy. On histopathologic confirmation consistent with anti-GABA-A receptor antibody-associated CNS inflammation, completing the first rituximab cycle, continuing oral corticosteroids and supplementing immunosuppression with cyclosporine A led to quick recovery.

Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is a hallmark of the disease. Several immunomodulatory treatments may slow but not halt the disease progression. The treatment of choice still relies on surgical hemispheric disconnection, which is burdened by heavy neurologic morbidity. More limited cortical resections, although more tolerable, are usually considered to be, at best, only transiently effective in RE. Hemispheric disconnections may be not feasible when neurologic functions are preserved and the dominant hemisphere is affected. Adult patients with a milder RE course that preserves neurologic function for a long period are particularly at risk of developing severe deficits after surgery. In this study we present the histories of two patients with adult-onset RE who have undergone selective cortical resections to control EPC, avoiding, at the same time, the severe postsurgical deficits that may be induced by hemispheric disconnective surgery. The good result obtained on EPC has been stable over a prolonged period; however, this result was not paralleled by the stop of neurologic progression in one of the two cases.

28430051,Reversible postoperative blindness caused by bilateral status epilepticus amauroticus following thoracolumbar deformity correction: case report.,"Ibrahim, Tarik F; Sweis, Rochelle T; Nockels, Russ P",Ibrahim,"Postoperative vision loss (POVL) is a devastating complication and has been reported after complex spine procedures. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and posterior optic neuropathy are the 2 most common causes of POVL. Bilateral occipital lobe seizures causing complete blindness are rare and have not been reported as a cause of POVL after spine surgery with the patient prone. The authors report the case of a 67-year-old man without a history of seizures who underwent a staged thoracolumbar deformity correction and developed POVL 6 hours after surgery. Imaging, laboratory, and ophthalmological examination results were nonrevealing. Routine electroencephalography study results were negative, but continuous electroencephalography captured bilateral occipital lobe seizures. The patient developed nonconvulsive status epilepticus despite initial treatment with benzodiazepines and loading doses of levetiracetam and lacosamide. He was therefore intubated for status epilepticus amauroticus and received a midazolam infusion. After electrographic seizure cessation for 48 hours, the patient was weaned off midazolam. The patient was maintained on levetiracetam and lacosamide without seizure recurrence and returned to his preoperative visual baseline status.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neurosurgery.

14695868,Non-convulsive status epilepticus in elderly individuals: report of four representative cases.,"Fernández-Torre, José L; Díaz-Castroverde, Apolinar G",Fernández-Torre,"the purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and electroencephalographic features of four elderly patients diagnosed as having non-convulsive status epilepticus. four females ranging in age from 74 to 81 years were admitted to our hospital because of confusion and altered mental state. We recognised four distinctive entities: i) Absence status in a patient with pre-existing idiopathic generalised epilepsy; ii) De novo absence status of late onset precipitated by benzodiazepine withdrawal; iii) Complex partial status epilepticus in a patient with a focal brain lesion; iv) Subtle generalised status epilepticus in a comatose subject representing the final phase of convulsive status epilepticus. the identification of non-convulsive status epilepticus may be particularly arduous in elderly subjects and, therefore, a high level of suspicion is essential to obtain an early diagnosis. An urgent electroencephalogram is considered as the method of choice in the diagnostic evaluation of non-convulsive status epilepticus. Finally, non-convulsive status epilepticus should be included among the causes of coma in older individuals.",{},,Age and ageing,10.1093/ageing/afh030,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the few reported cases, the seizures were brief and the underlying lesion usually was a tumor. Here the authors describe a patient with bilateral focal motor status epilepticus with retained consciousness after a stroke. A seizure should be considered as the possible cause of continuous bilateral limb movements with retained consciousness.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.54.4.976,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
