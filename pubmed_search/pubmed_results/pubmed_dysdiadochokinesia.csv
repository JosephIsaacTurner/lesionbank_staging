37551251,Marchiafava-Bignami Disease: A Rare Association With Dysdiadochokinesia and Ataxic Gait.,"Abouibrahim, Mahmoud; Agarwal, Ansh; Ottih, Ugochinyere; Ravendran, Kapilraj; Bista, Galaxy; Zafar, Mansoor; Hovagim, Garabedyan; Hacikurt, Kadir",Abouibrahim,"Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. The non-specific signs and symptoms associated with MBD including dysarthria, impaired walking, pyramidal signs, primitive reflexes, seizures, incontinence, sensory symptoms, gaze palsies, and altered mental state result in a challenging diagnosis. Here, we report the case of a 64-year-old female presenting with dizziness, gait ataxia, and a history of recurrent falls for several months. Initial blood tests indicated anaemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and mildly elevated inflammatory markers. Her presentation was initially attributed to a multifactorial aetiology, including a urinary tract infection, orthostatic hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances; however, on correction of reversible causes, her symptoms persisted. Moreover, further examination revealed right-hand dysdiadochokinesia. Subsequent brain MRI revealed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity within the corpus callosum and a right-sided pericallosal white matter hyperintensity. Neuro-radiology multidisciplinary team reported these findings consistent with MBD. Management with vitamin B supplementation was promptly initiated alongside alcohol cessation advice. She was also reviewed by physiotherapy teams. This case adds to the paucity of literature on MBD.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.41492,PMC10404341,ataxic gait; corpus callosum; dysdiadochokinesia; magnetic resonance imaging; marchiafava-bignami disease,Case Reports,United States,eng
34926071,COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy Resulting in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism.,"Abbas, Zaira; Chaudhary, Ali",Abbas,"Venous stroke is an infrequent complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acts as a causative factor for thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and myocardial infarction. We report a case of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) following severe COVID-19 infection, with co-incidence of pulmonary thromboembolism. A 39-year-old English lady presented with fever and cough; subsequently, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was managed in the high dependency unit (HDU) due to the severity of symptoms; she received dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Her condition improved and she was discharged, but presented again after 15 days due to headache and left-sided weakness. Her neurological examination confirmed nystagmus, past pointing, and dysdiadochokinesia positive on the left side. Initial blood investigations showed D-dimer being raised at 1875 ng/ml. Head CT venogram reported evidence of thrombus in the superior sagittal sinus, left transverse sinus, and inferior sagittal sinus consistent with venous sinus thrombosis. She also underwent CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) which revealed lingular acute segmental PE and patchy ground-glass shadowing throughout both lung fields, confirming recent infective COVID-19 changes. She was started on a therapeutic dose of dalteparin (low-molecular-weight heparin). Luckily she made a good recovery from her neurological symptoms. Like this case and many other reported cases, COVID-19 acts as an independent risk factor for increased coagulopathy. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CVT to aid in timely diagnosis and prompt treatment to save lives.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.19602,PMC8674063,cerebral venous thrombosis cvt; coagulopathy; covid 19; d-dimer; pulmonary embolism (pe),Case Reports,United States,eng

Wernekink commissure syndrome is due to lesions in the caudal paramedian midbrain involving the entire decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, resulting in the clinical hallmark of a bilateral cerebellar syndrome. A 79-year-old man presented with sudden, severe unsteadiness associated with slurring of speech, binocular double vision, and bilateral hand tremor. Examination showed right INO, moderately severe dysarthria, bilateral dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia, with severe truncal ataxia and bilateral upper and lower limb ataxia. Also, bilateral coarse tremor was noted in both hands which was present at rest, action and on reaching for objects. Brain MRI revealed an acute infarction involving the Wernekinck decussation in the right caudal midbrain and mesencephalo-pontine junction. The differential of Wernekink Commissure Syndrome is complex, and localization and lateralization are extremely difficult owing to prominent bilateral cerebellar symptoms. The finding of an associated unilateral INO in some cases makes it possible to confidently narrow the list of differentials and localize the lesion to the paramedian tegmentum ipsilateral to the non-adducting eye.",{},,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,,,Stroke; Mesencephalon; Cerebellar Syndromes; Ocular Motility Disorders.,Case Reports; Journal Article,China (Republic : 1949- ),eng

She had started low-dose pregabalin, 25 mg two times a day 9 months before experiencing symptoms with the dose gradually increased to 150 mg two times a day over this period. Clinical examination revealed difficulty performing eye pursuit with left eye and dysdiadochokinesia of the left arm. Owing to a suspicion of multiple sclerosis she underwent cerebral MRI, which was normal. Pregabalin was tapered over 2 months with a complete disappearance of the symptoms.

22178081,WEBINO and the return of the King's Speech.,"Beh, Shin C; Frohman, Elliot M",Beh,"We present a 69 year-old man with hypertension who developed the sudden onset of horizontal binocular diplopia and stuttering of speech. On examination, bilateral exotropia (i.e. 'wall-eyed') was observed in the primary position. Attempted horizontal saccades revealed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia; all consistent with the wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) syndrome. Convergence, vertical saccades and vestibular ocular reflexes were likewise impaired. Pupillary and levator palpebrae superioris functions were intact. Mild left-sided dysmetria, intention tremor and dysdiadochokinesia were elicited. Conspicuously, further characterization of the patient's history revealed that he had stuttered as a child, but it had resolved in adolescence. Brain MRI revealed an acute infarction of the mesencephalic and upper pontine tegmentum involving the periaqueductal gray region and the medial longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally with greater involvement of the left. Like the WEBINO syndrome, re-emergent developmental stuttering is a rare neurologic phenomenon. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a mesencephalic and upper pontine infarction causing both syndromes. We discuss the pathobiological underpinnings of the WEBINO syndrome and neurogenic stuttering and in relationship to this unusual case.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2011.11.035,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
26396618,Infratentorial hemorrhagic cerebral proliferative angiopathy: A rare presentation of a rare disease.,"Kumar, Sunil; Sharma, Mukesh; Srivastava, Trilochan; Sinha, Virendra Deo",Kumar,"Cerebral proliferative angiopathy (CPA) is a unique and rare vascular malformation with distinct clinico-radiological features. CPA is associated with low risk of hemorrhage as compared to classical cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Infratentorial location of diffuse nidus is also an uncommon presentation. Infratentorial hemorrhagic presentation of CPA is a rare co-occurrence. Herein, we report a case of an elderly old male, who presented with acute onset severe headache, recurrent vomiting, vertigo and swaying toward left side while walking. Cerebellar signs in the form of scanning speech, nystagmus, impaired finger-to-nose incoordination test, dysdiadochokinesia, and limb ataxia on the left side were present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed diffuse vascular network with intermingled normal brain parenchyma and hemorrhage in the left cerebellum. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed diffuse, ill-defined, nidus in left posterior fossa involving the left posterior inferior cerebellar, anterior inferior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arterial territories. There were no definite arterial feeders. DSA showed scattered ""puddling"" appearance of contrast material in the widespread nidus and drained into the multiple ill-defined posterior fossa veins. The MRI brain and DSA findings were consistent with the diagnosis of the CPA. Treatment in our case was limited to supportive medical therapy because selective embolization was not feasible due to nonidentifiable arterial feeders. He was asymptomatic at 1-year follow-up. This case highlights a rare entity called CPAs, which have different clinical presentations, angiographic features, treatment options and patient outcome as compared to classical cerebral AVMs.",{},,Asian journal of neurosurgery,10.4103/1793-5482.161185,PMC4553743,Cerebral proliferative angiopathy; arteriovenous malformations; infratentorial nidus; intracerebral hemorrhage,Case Reports,India,eng

Symptoms include apathy, confusion, and neurological deficits. We describe a 47-year-old male patient who inhaled gas from a kitchen stove liquid petroleum gas cylinder. He was diagnosed with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 12 hours after his emergency department admission. He received six sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) and was discharged in a healthy state after six days. Fifteen days later, he experienced weakness, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, depression, balance problems, and inability to perform self-care. One week later, he developed urinary and fecal incontinence and was diagnosed with post-hypoxic encephalopathy. After 45 days from the onset of symptoms, he was referred to the Underwater and Hyperbaric Medicine Department for HBOT. The patient exhibited poor self-care and slow speech rate, as well as ataxic gait and dysdiadochokinesia. Hyperbaric oxygen was administered for twenty-four sessions, which significantly improved the patient's neurological status with only hypoesthesia in the left hand remaining at the end of treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen has been reported as successful in treating some cases of delayed neurological sequelae following CO intoxication. It is possible that HBO therapy may also be effective in delayed post-hypoxic encephalopathy from other causes. This may be achieved through mechanisms such as transfer of functional mitochondria to the injury site, remyelination of damaged neurons, angiogenesis and neurogenesis, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and balancing of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.",{},,Diving and hyperbaric medicine,10.28920/dhm53.4.351-355,PMC10944663,Brain; Dementia; Hyperbaric medicine; Neurology; Toxicity,Case Reports,Australia,eng

His left forearm showed rigidity and bradykinesia, and it was difficult for the patient to smoothly perform rapid alternating movement testing. His complaints about hearing a rhythmic bruit above the left ear, particularly when lying down, alerted the physician of the presence of vascular lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography confirmed the diagnosis of DAVF. The patient received a combined surgical and endovascular approach to permanently block the fistula blood flow.

The most commonly feared complications include neural or vascular injury. Although both vertebral artery and internal carotid artery injuries have been discussed in the literature, there have been no reports of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) injury from C1 lateral mass screw placement. We report a case of patient who had a cerebellar stroke after C1 lateral mass screw placement, secondary to injury of an aberrant PICA. To describe the normal anatomy of the PICA, the anatomic variations previously reported in the literature, the sequela and symptoms of a patient with PICA injury, and the relevance to C1 lateral mass screw placement. No previous reports of PICA injury with a cerebellar stroke have been reported with C1 lateral mass screw instrumentation. Case report and literature review.

Accordingly, we performed a pathoanatomical analysis on serial thick sections stained for lipofuscin granules and Nissl substance through the thalami of two genetically confirmed cases: one an SCA2 patient, the other an SCA3 patient. During this systematic study, we detected severe destruction of the reticular (RT), fasciculosus (FA), ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), ventral posterior lateral (VPL), ventral posterior medial (VPM), cucullar (CU) and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei (MD), the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and inferior nucleus of the pulvinar (PU i) in the SCA2 case, and a severe neuronal loss in the RT, FA, VA and PU i of the SCA3 case. In the SCA2 patient, additional obvious neuronal loss was observed in all nuclei of the anterior and rostral intra laminar groups, in the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), the lateral (PU l) and the medial subnuclei of the pulvinar (PU m), whereas in the SCA3 patient only two of the nuclei that belong to the anterior thalamic group, the VL, VPL, VPM, LP, LGB, PU l and PU m, displayed marked neurodegeneration. These novel findings indicate that thalamic involvement in SCA2 and SCA3 patients has been underestimated in the past. In view of what is known about the functions of the affected thalamic nuclei, the present findings provide an appropriate pathoanatomical explanation for some of the disease-related symptoms seen in both of our and other SCA2 and SCA3 patients: gait, stance, truncal and limb ataxia, dysarthria or anarthria, falls, dysdiadochokinesia and bradykinesia, problems with writing, somatosensory deficits, saccadic dysfunctions, executive dysfunctions and abnormalities of visual evoked potentials.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awg234,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Neurological examination was significant for torsional nystagmus, motor aphasia, right-sided dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia with gait ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed right cerebellar lesion and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for JC virus. The diagnosis of JC virus-related cerebellar disease can be missed, due to the subacute to chronic onset and challenges in detection.

This diminished blood supply leads to decreased oxygen delivery, resulting in motor and balance control impairments. One prevalent sign of neurodegenerative diseases is dysphagia, which is typically linked to a higher death rate. No systematic and uniform assessment of dysphagia is used in the clinical care environment of individuals with ataxia. Its effect on the quality of life associated with health in patients is little understood. Therefore, this case report works to address dysphagia in cerebellar ataxia. This case report examines the physiotherapy management of a 41-year-old male who had cerebellar ataxia secondary to an infarct in the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere and vermis. The rehabilitation period lasted for six weeks. On examination, the patient had difficulty swallowing and showed symptoms of cerebellar dysfunctions, such as nystagmus, dyssynergia, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. Neuro-physiotherapy interventions, like conventional physiotherapy, trunk, and pelvis proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), Kinesio taping for dysphagia, interventions to treat gait, balance training interventions, and Frenkel's exercises were commenced. The outcome measures were evaluated using standardized outcome measures like the Swallowing Quality of Life Scale (SWAL-QOL), Severity of Ataxia Scale (SARA), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Barthel Index, and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO-QOL).

This syndrome should prompt lesional evaluation with neuroimaging focused on the dorsal midbrain, cerebellar outflow tracts, and thalamus. Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2014.11.013,PMC4866638,Behçet’s disease; Germinoma; Holmes tremor; Multiple sclerosis; Rubral tremor,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng
11145004,FDG- and Dopa-PET in postencephalitic parkinsonism.,"Ghaemi, M; Rudolf, J; Schmülling, S; Bamborschke, S; Heiss, W D",Ghaemi,"We report a case of a 74-year old woman who following an acute virus encephalitis developed an akinetic-rigid Parkinson syndrome with tremor, hypokinesia, hypomimia, rigidity and cogwheel phenomenon in all four extremities, brady-dysdiadochokinesia as well as myoclonic jerks of the arms. Many of the clinical features of this postencephalitic parkinsonism (PEP) suggested the diagnosis of sporadic encephalitis lethargica, first described by von Economo 1917. Cerebral spinal fluid showed signs of a viral encephalitis, and a positive influenza A IgA-antibody titer (1:>160) in the viral serologic screen was found. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed an altered pattern of glucose- and dopa-metabolism clearly different from findings in idiopathic Parkinson syndrome (IPS). The acute lack of inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum could explain the different metabolic patterns in our case in comparison to IPS patients. Our findings indicate that PEP may also be caused by influenza A and furthermore that PET clearly distinguishes PEP from IPS.",{},,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",10.1007/s007020070018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng
20046527,Cerebellar nocardiosis and myopathy from long-term corticosteroids for idiopathic thrombocytopenia.,"Frank, Marlies; Woschnagg, Herbert; Mölzer, Günther; Finsterer, Josef",Frank,"Infection of the central nervous system with Nocardia sp. usually manifests as supratentorial abscesses. Supratentorial and cerebellar abscesses from infection with Nocardia sp. following immunosuppression with long-term corticosteroids for idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) have not been reported. An 83 years-old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative, polymorbid male with ITP for which he required corticosteroids since age 53 years developed tiredness, dyspnoea, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and progressive gait disturbance. Imaging studies of the lung revealed an enhancing tumour in the right upper lobe with central and peripheral necrosis, multiple irregularly contoured hyperdensities over both lungs, and right-sided pleural effusions. Sputum culture grew Nocardia sp. Neurological diagnostic work-up revealed dysarthria, dysphagia, ptosis, hypoacusis, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, proximal weakness of the lower limbs, diffuse wasting, and stocking-type sensory disturbances. The neurological deficits were attributed to an abscess in the upper cerebellar vermis, myopathy from corticosteroids, and polyneuropathy. Meropenem for 37 days and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole for 3 months resulted in a reduction of the pulmonary, but not the cerebral lesions. Therefore, sultamicillin was begun, but without success. Long-term therapy with corticosteroids for ITP may induce not only steroid myopathy but also immune-incompetence with the development of pulmonary and cerebral nocardiosis. Cerebral nocardiosis may not sufficiently respond to long-term antibiotic therapy why switching to alternative antibiotics or surgery may be necessary.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Yonsei medical journal,10.3349/ymj.2010.51.1.131,PMC2799960,Infection; antibiotics; brain abscess; immunosuppression; opportunistic; steroid myopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,Korea (South),eng
8453455,"Very small (border zone) cerebellar infarcts. Distribution, causes, mechanisms and clinical features.","Amarenco, P; Kase, C S; Rosengart, A; Pessin, M S; Bousser, M G; Caplan, L R",Amarenco,"Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow accurate anatomical localization of large thromboembolic cerebellar infarcts in the territories of the cerebellar arteries and their branches. In addition, MRI and CT show very small cerebellar infarcts as discrete foci of signal change that are not easily localizable within well-defined arterial territories. They could be border zone infarcts. Their anatomy, mechanism and clinical features have not been studied. By reviewing our CT and MRI files over a 2-year period, we found 47 patients with very small cerebellar infarcts; 23 patients had angiography. Infarcts were cortical (32 patients), deep (10 patients) and both (five patients). Most lesions corresponded to border zone cerebellar infarcts. The mechanisms of infarction were (i) global hypoperfusion due to cardiac arrest (two patients); (ii) small or end (pial) artery disease due to intracranial atheroma or hypercoagulable states (nine patients); (iii) focal cerebellar hypoperfusion due to large artery (vertebral or basilar) occlusive disease (16 patients) or brain embolism (11 patients) resulting in infarcts in the watershed areas (27 patients total); (iv) unknown mechanism (nine patients, 19%). Large artery occlusive disease was more frequently observed in deep than in cortical infarcts (9 out of 15 versus 11 out of 37; P < 0.0001). The most frequent symptoms were dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness with axial lateropulsion, dysarthria and limb clumsiness. These symptoms were either transient or recurrent, at times related to positional changes of the head or trunk. Position-related symptoms often persisted for weeks or months after the ischaemic event, and occurred mainly in patients with combined carotid and vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. Physical findings were either absent or included wide-based gait, lateropulsion, mild ipsilateral dysmetria, dysarthria or dysdiadochokinesia. We conclude that very small cerebellar infarcts are often found on CT and MRI. Their border zone distribution and frequent posturally related symptoms most often result from large or pial artery disease rather than from systemic hypotension.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/116.1.161,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
9554191,Postinfectious cerebellitis: clinical significance of Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT compared with MRI.,"San Pedro, E C; Mountz, J M; Liu, H G; Deutsch, G",San Pedro,"We compared Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT and MRI with the clinical findings in a case of a 14-year-old boy with post-infectious cerebellitis. Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT scan showed marked reduction in perfusion to the left anterior lobe, left lateral hemisphere, and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum. The MRI showed a limited region of abnormal signal in the mid posterior left cerebellar hemisphere. Since the patient's overall neurological deficit was characterized by ataxia, nystagmus, head and body titubation, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, loss of normal check, and rebound testing attributed to the involvement of the anterior, lateral, and posterior lobes of the left cerebellar hemisphere, the Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT finding correlated better with the extent of functional neurological deficits. Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT may better assess cerebellar signs and symptoms in cerebellitis since the blood flow abnormalities correlated with dysfunction of the cerebellum, whereas the MRI abnormalities did not encompass the scope of the neurological deficits.",{},,Clinical nuclear medicine,10.1097/00003072-199804000-00004,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng
17260808,[Astasia in a patient with unilateral thalamic infarction: clinical and MRI study].,"Misumi, Youhei; Nishida, Yasuto; Araki, Shukuro",Misumi,"We report a 82-year-old woman who developed difficulty in standing and sitting in the morning. She had no other complaints and stayed in the bed. The next day, she was admitted to the hospital and neurological examination revealed that she was alert, with no other motor or sensory abnormalities. Finger to nose test, and knee to heel test were normal. No dysdiadochokinesia was seen. Astasia was the only observed abnormal finding. MRI showed a small infarction (14 x 8mm) in the posterolateral portion of the left thalamus (VPL-LP nucleus). During the following 15 days, her imbalance has gradually improved and then disappeared. We diagnosed the patient as astasia occurring from a small unilateral infarction in the thalamus. It is thought that thalamic astasia is caused by the disruption of afferent pathway from the vestibulocerebellum; however, this case is based on just clinical and MRI study, so physiological and pathological studies will be necessary in the future.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
3492744,[Hemiataxia and ipsilateral sensory deficit. Infarct in the area of the anterior choroidal artery. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis].,"Bogousslavsky, J; Regli, F; Delaloye, B; Delaloye-Bischoff, A; Uske, A; Despland, P A",Bogousslavsky,"A 58 year old hypertensive man suffered an acute right-sided hemiataxia associated with painful hypoesthesia. CT showed an infarct in the territory of the left anterior choroidal artery. The sensory defect involved all the elementary modes, but predominated on pain sensation. The ataxia suggested a cerebellar type of dysfunction, with hypermetria, intentional tremor, dysdiadochokinesia and a positive rebound phenomenon. There was no hemiparesis, no hemianopia, no neuropsychological dysfunction and no oculomotor abnormality. Hemiataxia with hemisensory defect has not been reported in stroke, and it constitutes a new clinical form of lacunar syndrome. The hemiataxia may be related to the finding on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 123 I-amphetamine of a crossed cerebellar diaschisis, which may suggest a transneuronal deactivation. This metabolic depression may have been due to involvement of the temporo-parieto-pontine bundle of Türck in the retro and sub-lenticular portion of the internal capsule. The finding of a normal cortical blood flow may explain why no neuropsychological impairment was present, because of the absence of functional deactivation of the cortex by the underlying deep infarct.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
7326887,"[Frontal pseudoataxia, discussion on its mechanism (author's transl)].","Sunohara, N; Mukoyama, M; Mano, Y; Toyoshima, E; Satoyoshi, E",Sunohara,"We presented a rare care who had right frontal lobe infarction, with left side pseudoataxia, and the mechanism, causing pseudoataxia, was considered. The patient, a 51 year-old, righ-handed male, was admitted on August 9, 1980, complaining of left-side pseudoataxia. About p.m. 7:00, July 29, 1980, he suddenly noticed numbness of the left foot, and he found himself difficulty in standing in the next morning. He had a mild paresis and tactile-tactile of the left side including the face, which was rapidly improved. However, there was pseudoataxia of the left extremities, which had not been improved. On physical examination, dysarthria, aphasia, finger agnosia, difficulty in right left orientation or muscle weakness was not recognized, and there was no sensory disturbance except for slight impairment of stereognosis, two point discrimination and vibratory sense. Demonstrable impairment of tactiletactile from was observed in the left hand. Notable dysmetria, terminal tremor and dysdiadochokinesia were seen in the left limbs, which were remarkably worsened with eyes closed. However, tapping and line-drawing tests were normal. Babinski-Weil's test disclosed typical compass gait. There was marked swaying in Romberg position. Tandem gait was impossible with a tendency to decline the left. Deep reflexies were normal except for mildly hyperactive radial reflex in the left. Carotid and vertebral angiographies revealed neither evidence of vascular occlusion nor displacement of vessels CT scan demonstrated a low density area, which included the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, the head of the right caudate nucleus and a part of anterior crus of right internal capsule. There was enlargement of anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. Caloric test, electronystagmography, eye tracking test or optokinetic nystagmus test disclosed no abnormalities. Vibration induced falling, which is the postural reaction to muscle vibration during standing (Ekuland, G., 1972), was not recognized when the left Achiles' tendon was stimulated. Pseudoataxia of this patient differed from the typical cerebellar or vestibular ataxia. From a review of the literatures concerning frontal pseudoataxia, almost all cases had no distinct cerebellar signs, and showed positive Romberg's sign. The impairment of tactile-tactile form and postural reaction to vibratory stimulation to the left leg, appeared in this case, could be hardly explained by the lesion of parietal lobe or deconnection syndrome. Sensory perception of parietal lobe and pyramidal motor system were thought to be almost normal in this case. Therefore, these findings should be due to impairment of integration center between sensory and motor systems. The pseudoataxia in frontal lesion seems to occur as the results of involvement of this center, in which caudate nucleus maybe has important role, but not as the results of disturbances in the front-ponto-cerebellar or front vestibular pathway.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
