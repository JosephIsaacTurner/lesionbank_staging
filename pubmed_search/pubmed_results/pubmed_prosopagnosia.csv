36966620,Persistent prosopagnosia following COVID-19.,"Kieseler, Marie-Luise; Duchaine, Brad",Kieseler,"COVID-19 can cause psychological problems including loss of smell and taste, long-lasting memory, speech, and language impairments, and psychosis. Here, we provide the first report of prosopagnosia following symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Annie is a 28-year-old woman who had normal face recognition prior to contracting COVID-19 in March 2020. Two months later, she noticed face recognition difficulties while experiencing symptom relapses and her deficits with faces have persisted. On two tests of familiar face recognition and two tests of unfamiliar face recognition, Annie showed clear impairments. In contrast, she scored normally on tests assessing face detection, face identity perception, object recognition, scene recognition, and non-visual memory. Navigational deficits frequently co-occur with prosopagnosia, and Annie reports that her navigational abilities are substantially worse than before she became ill. Self-report survey data from 54 respondents with long COVID showed that a majority reported reductions in visual recognition and navigation abilities. In summary, Annie's results indicate that COVID-19 can produce severe and selective neuropsychological impairments similar to deficits seen following brain damage, and it appears that high-level visual impairments are not uncommon in people with long COVID.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.01.012,PMC9995301,COVID-19; Case study; Face blindness; Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC); Prosopagnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

We gathered a substantial dataset of high-density electrophysiological recordings from both PS and neurotypicals. Using representational similarity analysis, we produced time-resolved brain representations in a format that facilitates direct comparisons across time points, different individuals, and computational models. To understand how the lesions in PS's ventral stream affect the temporal evolution of her brain representations, we computed the temporal generalization of her brain representations. We uncovered that PS's early brain representations exhibit an unusual similarity to later representations, implying an excessive generalization of early visual patterns. To reveal the underlying computational deficits, we correlated PS' brain representations with those of deep neural networks (DNN). We found that the computations underlying PS' brain activity bore a closer resemblance to early layers of a visual DNN than those of controls. However, the brain representations in neurotypicals became more akin to those of the later layers of the model compared to PS. We confirmed PS's deficits in high-level brain representations by demonstrating that her brain representations exhibited less similarity with those of a DNN of semantics.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/bhae211,PMC11127037,EEG; RSA; artificial neural networks; prosopagnosia; semantic representations,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng
22764352,[Neurological disease and facial recognition].,"Kawamura, Mitsuru; Sugimoto, Azusa; Kobayakawa, Mutsutaka; Tsuruya, Natsuko",Kawamura,"To discuss the neurological basis of facial recognition, we present our case reports of impaired recognition and a review of previous literature. First, we present a case of infarction and discuss prosopagnosia, which has had a large impact on face recognition research. From a study of patient symptoms, we assume that prosopagnosia may be caused by unilateral right occipitotemporal lesion and right cerebral dominance of facial recognition. Further, circumscribed lesion and degenerative disease may also cause progressive prosopagnosia. Apperceptive prosopagnosia is observed in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), pathologically considered as Alzheimer's disease, and associative prosopagnosia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Second, we discuss face recognition as part of communication. Patients with Parkinson disease show social cognitive impairments, such as difficulty in facial expression recognition and deficits in theory of mind as detected by the reading the mind in the eyes test. Pathological and functional imaging studies indicate that social cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease is possibly related to damages in the amygdalae and surrounding limbic system. The social cognitive deficits can be observed in the early stages of Parkinson disease, and even in the prodromal stage, for example, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show impairment in facial expression recognition. Further, patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1), which is a multisystem disease that mainly affects the muscles, show social cognitive impairment similar to that of Parkinson disease. Our previous study showed that facial expression recognition impairment of DM 1 patients is associated with lesion in the amygdalae and insulae. Our study results indicate that behaviors and personality traits in DM 1 patients, which are revealed by social cognitive impairment, are attributable to dysfunction of the limbic system.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
35051711,False recognition/misidentification of unfamiliar person after cerebral infarction: A case report.,"Sugahara, Yumiko; Iizuka, Chiaki; Doi, Kazuya; Matsuzaki, Kenichiro; Nagaoka, Masanori",Sugahara,"An 84-year-old man manifested false recognition/misidentification of unfamiliar person after cardiogenic cerebral infarction. He had good visual and hearing acuity, no hemianopsia, unilateral spatial neglect and visual object agnosia. However, he was unable to remember faces of his rehabilitation therapists, and repeatedly misidentified other patients' visitors and therapists as his family members and friends, without recognizing his mistakes. General cognitive function was preserved with Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) 25/30 (cut-off score 20). In terms of recognition of faces, tasks not requiring recognition of facial identity, such as interpreting facial emotions, and gender and age assessment, were relatively preserved, but recognition of family members and celebrities was severely impaired, and matching unfamiliar faces was slightly impaired. Semantic information of family and friends was retained. Although his symptoms resembled associative prosopagnosia, they differed from general associative prosopagnosia in having phonagnosia. MRI lesions were localized in the frontal and temporal lobes including the right anterior temporal lobe, and not in the right occipital and temporal lobes considered to the lesion site of multimodal people recognition disorders manifesting inability of utilization of visual (face) and auditory (voice) cues for person identification. In addition to the facial cognitive impairment, impaired exploratory (monitoring) function of the frontal lobe on the temporal lobe may also contribute to the false recognition/misidentification of this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.12.005,,Associative prosopagnosia; Cerebral infarction; False recognition/misidentification; Frégoli syndrome; Multimodal people recognition disorders; Right fronto-temporal lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

At 18 years of age she had developed secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Preoperative neuropsychological evaluation was normal, and neurological examination revealed only a left superior quadrant achromatopsia. MRI revealed a circumscribed lesion in the right inferolateral temporo-occipital junction. Following surgery she was agitated for 36 hours, and afterward, when her attention and orientation improved, she was unable to recognize familiar faces. She could, however, recognize familiar voices. Her prosopagnosia resolved over the next 6-7 days. This case demonstrates that isolated prosopagnosia can occur in patients with lesions restricted to the right inferior posterior temporal-anterior occipital region.

30670082,The hidden identity of faces: a case of lifelong prosopagnosia.,"Wegrzyn, Martin; Garlichs, Annika; Heß, Richard W K; Woermann, Friedrich G; Labudda, Kirsten",Wegrzyn,"Not being able to recognize a person's face is a highly debilitating condition from which people with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) suffer their entire life. Here we describe the case of J, a 30 year old woman who reports being unable to recognize her parents, her husband, or herself in the mirror. We set out to assess the severity of J's prosopagnosia using tests with unfamiliar as well as familiar faces and investigated whether impaired configural processing explains her deficit. To assess the specificity of the impairment, we tested J's performance when evaluating emotions, intentions, and the attractiveness and likability of faces. Detailed testing revealed typical brain activity patterns for faces and normal object recognition skills, and no evidence of any brain injury. However, compared to a group of matched controls, J showed severe deficits in learning new faces, and in recognizing familiar faces when only inner features were available. Her recognition of uncropped faces with blurred features was within the normal range, indicating preserved configural processing when peripheral features are available. J was also unimpaired when evaluating intentions and emotions in faces. In line with healthy controls, J rated more average faces as more attractive. However, she was the only one to rate them as less likable, indicating a preference for more distinctive and easier to recognize faces. Taken together, the results illustrate both the severity and the specificity of DP in a single case. While DP is a heterogeneous disorder, an inability to integrate the inner features of the face into a whole might be the best explanation for the difficulties many individuals with prosopagnosia experience.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC psychology,10.1186/s40359-019-0278-z,PMC6343346,Configural processing; Developmental prosopagnosia; Face perception; Object recognition; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
38559526,Prosopagnosia Due to Metastatic Brain Tumor: A Case-Based Review.,"Ivanova, Nora I; Kyuchukova, Dayana M; Tsalta-Mladenov, Mihael E; Georgieva, Darina K; Andonova, Silva P",Ivanova,"Prosopagnosia, also referred to as ""face blindness,"" is a type of visual agnosia characterized by a decreased capacity to recognize familiar faces with a preserved ability to identify individuals based on non-facial visual traits or voice. Prosopagnosia can be categorized as developmental (DP) or acquired (AP) owing to a variety of underlying conditions, including trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, neuroinfections, and, less frequently, malignancies. Facial recognition is a complex process in which different neuronal networks are involved. The infrequent but notable higher visual-processing abnormalities can be caused by lesions of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in the non-dominant temporal lobe. We report a rare case of AP in a 69-year-old patient who is right-hand dominant with rectal carcinoma cerebral metastases. The patient complained of dizziness, vertigo, falls, and trouble recognizing her family members' faces. The CT scan of the head with contrast revealed two metastatic brain lesions with vasogenic edema, as one of them was in the right cerebellar hemisphere, causing dislocation and compression of the ILF. Corticosteroids and osmotherapy were utilized as a conservative treatment approach, which resulted in the prosopagnosia being completely withdrawn. In conclusion, patients with primary brain tumors or metastatic disease rarely present with an isolated cognitive deficit such as prosopagnosia. Based on the anatomical features and the personalized approach, a conservative or surgical approach may be useful to improve higher cortical functioning.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.55349,PMC10981948,acquired prosopagnosia; brain tumor; cerebral tumor; cognitive; face blindness; higher cortical functions; language disorder; metastatic; prosopagnosia; tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

One year after onset, he showed marked apperceptive prosopagnosia and could not name people from their voices, although he had spared semantic knowledge about people he could not name and could access this knowledge from people's voice. Importantly, the patient was able to retrieve proper name of persons after their description and was able to name sounds and songs; he could also retrieve proper names of monuments, towns and cartoon characters upon visual presentation. No further relevant cognitive impairment was present. This clinical picture represents the auditory counterpart of prosopanomia and could be defined 'phonoanomia'. This case report suggests that naming people from their voice implies specific retrieval processes, and pose specific constraints to theoretical models of person recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.12.011,,Hemorrhagic stroke; Naming; People recognition; Rehabilitation; Temporal lobe; Voice,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Homonymous visual field defects are often present but do not explain the recognition difficulty. In ""alexia without agraphia"" (pure alexia), the intact right visual cortex is disconnected from the left parietal language center by a lesion in the splenium. In ""prosopagnosia,"" visual cortex is disconnected bilaterally from temporal cortex. In simultanagnosia, visual association cortex is damaged. The first condition is most commonly caused by left posterior cerebral artery occlusion, the second by bilateral posterior cerebral artery occlusion or head trauma, and the third by watershed infarction, tumors, abscesses, head trauma, leukoencephalopathies and Alzheimer's disease.

21414330,Implicit attitudes in prosopagnosia.,"Knutson, Kristine M; DeTucci, Karen A; Grafman, Jordan",Knutson,"We studied a male with acquired prosopagnosia using a battery of Implicit Association Tests (IATs) to investigate whether observing faces varying by social category would activate the patient's implicit social biases. We also asked him to categorize faces explicitly by race, gender, and political party. The patient, G.B., was marginally slower to categorize black compared to white faces. He showed congruency effects in the race and celebrity IATs, but not in the gender or political IATs. These results indicate that G.B. possesses an implicit social sensitivity to certain facial stimuli despite an inability to overtly recognize familiar faces. The results demonstrate that social biases can be retrieved based on facial stimuli via pathways bypassing the fusiform gyri. Thus the IAT effect can be added to the list of covert recognition effects found in prosopagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.03.009,PMC3100369,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here we report neuropsychological data from an architect (PL518) who lost his ability for visual imagery following a bilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. We compare his profile to three other patients with bilateral PCA stroke and another architect with a large PCA lesion confined to the right hemisphere. We also compare structural images of their lesions, aiming to delineate cerebral areas selectively lesioned in acquired aphantasia. When comparing the neuropsychological profile and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the aphantasic architect PL518 to patients with either a comparable background (an architect) or bilateral PCA lesions, we find: (1) there is a large overlap of cognitive deficits between patients, with the very notable exception of aphantasia which only occurs in PL518, and (2) there is large overlap of the patients' lesions. The only areas of selective lesion in PL518 is a small patch in the left fusiform gyrus as well as part of the right lingual gyrus. We suggest that these areas, and perhaps in particular the region in the left fusiform gyrus, play an important role in the cerebral network involved in visual imagery.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci10020059,PMC7071355,aphantasia; posterior cerebral artery; prosopagnosia; stroke; visual imagery; visual perception,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
30545601,The cortical face network of the prosopagnosic patient PS with fast periodic stimulation in fMRI.,"Gao, Xiaoqing; Vuong, Quoc C; Rossion, Bruno",Gao,"Following brain damage, the patient PS suffers from selective impairment in recognizing individuals by their faces, i.e., prosopagnosia. Her case has been documented in more than 30 publications to date, informing about the nature of individual face recognition and its neural basis. Here we report new functional neuroimaging data obtained on PS with a recently developed fast periodic stimulation functional imaging (FPS-fMRI) paradigm combining high sensitivity, specificity and reliability in identifying the cortical face-selective network (Gao et al., 2018). We define the extent of the large and reliable face-selective activation in the lateral section of the right middle fusiform gyrus, i.e., right FFA, which forms a single cluster of activation lying at the anterior border of the patient's main lesion in the inferior occipital gyrus. The contribution of posterior face-selective responses in the right or left inferior occipital gyrus is ruled out, strongly supporting the view that face-selective activity emerges in the right middle fusiform gyrus of the patient's brain from non-face-selective inputs from early visual areas. Despite this, low-level visual cues, i.e., amplitude spectrum of images, do not contribute to neural face-selective responses anywhere in the patient's cortical face network. This sensitive face-localizer approach also reveals an intact face-selective network anterior to the fusiform gyrus, including clusters in the ventral anterior temporal lobe (occipito-temporal sulcus and temporal pole) and the inferior frontal gyrus, with a right hemispheric dominance. Overall, with the exception of the left inferior occipital gyrus, the cortical face network of the prosopagnosic patient PS appears remarkably similar to typical individuals in non-brain damaged regions. However, unlike in neurotypical adults tested in the present study, including age-matched controls, a novel paradigm based on FPS-FMRI confirms that the patient's face network is insensitive to differences between rapidly presented pictures of unfamiliar individual faces, in line with her prosopagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2018.11.008,,Face categorization; Individual face discrimination; Prosopagnosia; fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We present a case of delayed diagnosis of prosopagnosia after a right hemisphere stroke in an elderly man whose chief complaint was persistent and progressive ""blurred vision"" without facial recognition impairment. Ophthalmic tests revealed a homonymous left upper quadrantanopia, with normal visual acuity. He was found by accident to barely recognize familiar faces. The patient showed severe deficit in face recognition and perception tests, and mild memory loss in neuropsychological assessments. Further functional MRI revealed the visual recognition deficits were face-specific. After behavioral intervention, the patient started to rely on other cues to compensate for poor facial recognition. His prosopagnosia showed no obvious improvement eight months after the stroke, which had negative impact on his social network.

Perceptual abnormalities have been reported in single cases or small series, but the causal link of such deficits to prosopagnosia is unclear. Our goal was to identify candidate perceptual processes that might contribute to prosopagnosia, by subjecting several prosopagnosic patients to a battery of functions that may be necessary for accurate facial perception. We tested seven prosopagnosic patients. Three had unilateral right occipitotemporal lesions, two had bilateral posterior occipitotemporal lesions, and one had right anterior-to-occipital temporal damage along with a small left temporal lesion. These lesions all included the fusiform face area, in contrast to one patient with bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Most patients had impaired performance on face-matching tests and difficulty with subcategory judgments for non-face objects. The most consistent deficits in patients with lesions involving the fusiform face area were impaired perception of spatial relations in dot patterns and reduced contrast sensitivity in the 4 to 8 cycles deg(-1) range. Patients with bilateral lesions were impaired in saturation discrimination. Luminance discrimination was normal in all but two patients, and spatial resolution was uniformly spared. Curvature and line-orientation discrimination were impaired in only one patient, who also had the most difficulty with more basic-level object recognition. We conclude that deficits in luminance, spatial resolution, curvature, line orientation, and contrast at low spatial frequencies are unlikely to contribute to apperceptive prosopagnosia. More relevant may be contrast sensitivity at higher spatial frequencies and the analysis of object spatial structure. Deficits in these functions may impair perception of subtle variations in object shape, and may be one mechanism by which the recognition defect in prosopagnosia can extend to other classes of object subcategorization.",{},,Perception,10.1068/p5243,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Here, the authors describe a 57-year-old right hand-dominant female with a large breast cancer brain metastasis in the right temporal lobe who underwent resection and subsequent Gamma Knife radiosurgery. She presented with difficulty with facial recognition, but following surgical intervention, the prosopagnosia became more profound. Even in nondominant cortex, significant deficits can arise when operating near higher visual-processing centers, including the ILF. This case highlights the utility of imaging-based tractography obtained from preoperative imaging for resective surgical planning even when operating in areas that do not involve what is traditionally considered elegant areas of the brain. To optimize neurological outcomes in metastatic tumor resection, awareness and diffusion tensor imaging of neighboring, displaced white matter tracts may prevent permanent deficits in higher visual processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neurosurgery.

People with Acquired Prosopagnosia (AP), who have lost the ability to recognise faces after a brain lesion, should thus show atypical holistic coding. Our aim is to use the composite-face effect (CFE) as a measure of holistic processing in ST, a 48-year-old woman with AP but normal recognition of facial expressions of emotions, and matched healthy control participants. Two experiments examining the CFE for identity (Experiment 1) and for expression of emotions (Experiment 2) were conducted. Contrary to controls, in both experiments, ST showed an atypical (i.e., reversed) CFE, thus suggesting altered holistic mechanisms affecting both components of perceptual judgement. Results also suggest that normal facial expression recognition is achievable even with holistic processing difficulties, possibly through compensatory, part-based, mechanisms.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643294.2020.1718071,,Face; emotions; expression; holistic; identity; prosopagnosia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The patient showed a variety of higher visual symptoms which changed over the recovery phase of the disease. In chronological order, she experienced cortical blindness, amblyopia, dyschromatopsia, static form agnosia, and prosopagnosia. Among these symptoms, the most intriguing was the static form agnosia. Although she could recognize the forms of moving objects, she could not make out those of stationary ones. All of these visual symptoms were transient, implying that she might have incidentally regained the function of the distinct cortical visual areas in the time course of follow-up.

In addition, P300 latency varied from 700 to 800 msec according to the familiarity of the faces, and P300 scalp location was different as a function of faces probability and overt recognition.

Contrasts between their scanning of upright versus inverted faces may index the presence of a hypothesized orientation-dependent expert mechanism for processing faces, while contrasts between their scanning of familiar versus novel faces may index the influence of residual facial memories on their search for meaningful facial information. We recorded the eye movements of two prosopagnosics while they viewed faces. One patient, with acquired prosopagnosia from a right occipitotemporal lesion, showed degraded orientation effects but still with a normal distribution of fixations to more salient facial features. However, the dynamics of his global scan patterns were more chaotic for novel faces, suggesting degradation of an internal facial schema, and consistent with other evidence of impaired face configuration perception in this patient. His global scan patterns for famous faces differed from novel faces, suggesting the influence of residual facial memories, as indexed previously by his relatively good imagery for famous faces. The other patient, with a developmental prosopagnosia, showed anomalous orientation effects, abnormal distribution of fixations to less salient regions, and chaotic global scan patterns, in keeping with a more severe loss of face-expert mechanisms. The effects of fame on her scanning were weaker than those in the first subject and non-existent in her global scan patterns. We conclude that scan patterns in prosopagnosia can both reflect the loss of orientation-dependent expert mechanisms and index the covert influence of residual facial memories. In these two subjects the scanning data were consistent with other results from tests of configuration perception, imagery, and covert recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-007-0923-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

20547387,A new selective developmental deficit: Impaired object recognition with normal face recognition.,"Germine, Laura; Cashdollar, Nathan; Düzel, Emrah; Duchaine, Bradley",Germine,"Studies of developmental deficits in face recognition, or developmental prosopagnosia, have shown that individuals who have not suffered brain damage can show face recognition impairments coupled with normal object recognition (Duchaine and Nakayama, 2005; Duchaine et al., 2006; Nunn et al., 2001). However, no developmental cases with the opposite dissociation - normal face recognition with impaired object recognition - have been reported. The existence of a case of non-face developmental visual agnosia would indicate that the development of normal face recognition mechanisms does not rely on the development of normal object recognition mechanisms. To see whether a developmental variant of non-face visual object agnosia exists, we conducted a series of web-based object and face recognition tests to screen for individuals showing object recognition memory impairments but not face recognition impairments. Through this screening process, we identified AW, an otherwise normal 19-year-old female, who was then tested in the lab on face and object recognition tests. AW's performance was impaired in within-class visual recognition memory across six different visual categories (guns, horses, scenes, tools, doors, and cars). In contrast, she scored normally on seven tests of face recognition, tests of memory for two other object categories (houses and glasses), and tests of recall memory for visual shapes. Testing confirmed that her impairment was not related to a general deficit in lower-level perception, object perception, basic-level recognition, or memory. AW's results provide the first neuropsychological evidence that recognition memory for non-face visual object categories can be selectively impaired in individuals without brain damage or other memory impairment. These results indicate that the development of recognition memory for faces does not depend on intact object recognition memory and provide further evidence for category-specific dissociations in visual recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.04.009,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Initial neuropsychological and eye-movement investigations indicated that EM had profound difficulties in face perception as well as face recognition. EM underwent 14 weeks of perceptual training in an online programme that attempted to improve her ability to make fine-grained discriminations between faces. Following training, EM's face perception skills had improved, and the effect generalised to untrained faces. Eye-movement analyses also indicated that EM spent more time viewing the inner facial features post-training. Examination of EM's face recognition skills revealed an improvement in her recognition of personally-known faces when presented in a laboratory-based test, although the same gains were not noted in her everyday experiences with these faces. In addition, EM did not improve on a test assessing the recognition of newly encoded faces. One month after training, EM had maintained the improvement on the eye-tracking test, and to a lesser extent, her performance on the familiar faces test. This pattern of findings is interpreted as promising evidence that the programme can improve face perception skills, and with some adjustments, may at least partially improve face recognition skills.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2014.973886,,Encephalitis; Face recognition; Prosopagnosia; Rehabilitation; Training,Case Reports; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe a classic case of selective apperceptive prosopagnosia due to an ischemic infarct of the left occipital lobe with extension to the lingual gyrus. It is well-established that acquired prosopagnosia usually involves the right more than the left occipital cortex, with localization of lesions bilaterally more than unilaterally. The ischemic infarcts strategically involve the fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, the fundus of the posterior temporal sulcus, parahippocampal gyrus, and, rarely, lingual gyrus, which is almost always not a solitary finding.

Introducing this approach in face perception research showed that the performance pattern of a brain-damaged patient with acquired prosopagnosia (PS) in a face matching task was reversed, as compared to normal observers: the patient showed almost no further decrease of performance when only one facial part (eye, mouth, nose, etc.) was available at a time (foveal window condition, forcing part-based analysis), but a very large impairment when the fixated part was selectively masked (mask condition, promoting holistic perception) (Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Busigny, & Rossion, 2010a; Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Rossion, & Lefèvre, 2010b). Here we tested the same manipulation in a recently reported case of pure prosopagnosia (GG) with unilateral right hemisphere damage (Busigny, Joubert, Felician, Ceccaldi, & Rossion, 2010). Contrary to normal observers, GG was also significantly more impaired with a mask than with a window, demonstrating impairment with holistic face perception. Together with our previous study, these observations support a generalized account of acquired prosopagnosia as a critical impairment of holistic (individual) face perception, implying that this function is a key element of normal human face recognition. Furthermore, the similar behavioral pattern of the two patients despite different lesion localizations supports a distributed network view of the neural face processing structures, suggesting that the key function of human face processing, namely holistic perception of individual faces, requires the activity of several brain areas of the right hemisphere and their mutual connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.010,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Comparing faces to non-face objects elicited activation in all visual areas of the cortical face processing network that were spared subsequent to brain damage. The common brain lesion in the two patients was in the right inferior occipital cortex, in the territory of the right ""occipital face area"" ('OFA'), which strengthens the critical role of this region in processing faces. Despite the lesion to the right 'OFA', there was normal range of sensitivity to faces in the right ""fusiform face area"" ('FFA') in both patients, supporting a non-hierarchical model of face processing at the cortical level. At the same time, however, sensitivity to individual face representations, as indicated by release from adaptation to identity, was abnormal in the right 'FFA' of both patients. This suggests that the right 'OFA' is necessary to individualize faces, perhaps through reentrant interactions with other cortical face sensitive areas. The lateral occipital area (LO) is damaged bilaterally in patient DF, who also shows visual object agnosia. However, in patient PS, in whom LO was spared, sensitivity to individual representations of non-face objects was still found in this region, as in the normal brain, consistent with her preserved object recognition abilities.

More interestingly, relative to noise and unfamiliar voices, the familiar voices elicited greater haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus and medial parietal regions including the dorsal pCG and precuneus. The findings are consistent with theories implicating the pCG in recognizing people who are personally familiar, and furthermore suggest that the pCG region of the voice identification network is able to make functional contributions to voice recognition even though other areas of the network, namely the anterior temporal poles, FFA, and the right parietal lobe, may be compromised.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x246131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

34290220,Unusual Movement Disorders and Atypical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Findings in Patients with West Nile Encephalitis: Case Reports of 2 Patients with Evidence of Clinical and Imaging Resolution with IVIG.,"Sheikh, Irfan S; Afreen, Ehad; Sheikh, Ajaz",Sheikh,"BACKGROUND West Nile virus (WNv) is the leading cause of epidemic arbovirus encephalitis in the continental United States. Movement disorders (MDs) have been reported in 20% to 40% of patients with WNv and about 37% of patients with WNv encephalitis have changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report 2 unusual cases of neuroinvasive WNv in patients with unusual MDs and unreported MRI findings. CASE REPORT In the first case, a 34-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of disinhibition, agitation, opsoclonus-myoclonus and ataxia syndrome (OMAS), tremor, and facial agnosia. Evaluation of his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed elevated immunoglobulin (Ig)M against WNv, a high level of protein (98 mg/dL), and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count (134, 37% lymphocytes). An MRI of the brain showed an area of diffusion restriction in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The patient's MRI findings and OMA improved significantly after 2 treatments with i.v. IG (IVIG). In the second case, a 57-year-old woman presented with fever, headaches, psychosis, and ataxia; she was subsequently intubated for airway protection. Analysis of her CSF showed elevated IgM against WNv, a high level of protein (79 mg/dL), and elevated WBC count (106, 90% lymphocytes). One week after the onset of symptoms, the patient experienced facial dyskinesia. Later, she developed proximal bilateral lower extremity weakness. An MRI of her lumbar spine showed evidence of myeloradiculitis with contrast enhancement of the conus medullaris and ventral nerve roots. After a single treatment with IVIG, she had partial improvement in weakness. CONCLUSIONS MDs and changes on MRI have been reported in patients with neuroinvasive WNv disease. Our patient with OMAS also had transient splenial diffusion restriction on imaging, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously reported with WNv infection. In both patients, treatment with IVIG resulted in improvement in symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.932215,PMC8311389,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

An autopsied case.,"Landis, T; Regard, M; Bliestle, A; Kleihues, P",Landis,"It has been postulated that for prosopagnosia to occur, bilateral lesions of the central visual system are usually necessary. All but 1 of the 10 previously documented cases that came to autopsy showed this pattern. However, the long survival period after the onset of prosopagnosia in most of these patients limits the value of the autopsy findings for clinicopathological correlation. A patient is presented who died 10 days after she had developed prosopagnosia, topographagnosia and an agnosia for real objects seen from noncanonical views. These clinical symptoms corresponded directly to the autopsy finding of a recent large occipitotemporal ischaemic infarct in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. An additional right frontal infarct and a cortical microinfarct in a deep left lateral parieto-occipital sulcus were both old lesions and had passed unnoticed clinically.

The patient with the right posterior stroke can read it but not recognize whose handwriting it is; the patient with the left posterior stroke cannot read the text but knows who wrote it. The analysis of spatial vision revealed that the prosopagnosic patient has no problem with seeing texture elements when presented in isolation. Yet she performs poorly with Moiré and texture perception, i.e. she suffers from a selective loss of global visual perception. The alexic patient performs well with Moiré patterns but neither with (complex) texture elements nor with textures. She seemingly can locally and globally process patterns composed of simple figural elements but fails with stimuli that require the integration of features. This finding of a concomitant dissociation of local and global visual processes in the two patients supports the view that prosopagnosia as well as alexia are the most conspicuous aspects of more general alterations of visual perception.",{},,Vision research,10.1016/0042-6989(94)90045-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Here, we investigated what aspects of face processing are impaired/spared in developmental prosopagnosia by examining a relatively large group of individuals with DP (n = 8) using an extensive battery of well-established tasks. The tasks included measures of sensitivity to global motion and to global form, detection that a stimulus is a face, determination of its sex, holistic face processing, processing of face identity based on features, contour, and the spacing of features, and judgments of attractiveness. The DP cases showed normal sensitivity to global motion and global form and performed normally on our tests of face detection and holistic processing. On the other tasks, many DP cases were impaired but there was no systematic pattern. At least half showed deficits in processing of facial identity based on either the outer contour or spacing of the internal features, and/or on judgments of attractiveness. Three of the eight were impaired in processing facial identify based on the shape of internal features. The results show that DP is a heterogeneous condition and that impairment in recognizing faces cannot be predicted by poor performance on any one measure of face processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2005.11.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Two had difficulty perceiving feature colour, which correlated with reduced luminance sensitivity. In contrast to adult-onset patients, saturation discrimination was spared in two and spatial resolution impaired in two. Curvature discrimination was relatively spared. Contrast sensitivity showed variable reductions at different spatial frequencies.

Behaviourally, Herschel is severely impaired with the recognition of familiar faces, discrimination between unfamiliar identities, and the perception of facial expression and gender. Notably, his visual recognition deficits are largely restricted to faces, suggesting that the damaged mechanisms are face-specific. He showed normal recognition memory for a wide variety of object classes in several paradigms, normal ability to discriminate between highly similar items within a novel object category, and intact ability to name basic objects (except four-legged animals). Furthermore, Herschel displayed a normal face composite effect and typical global advantage and global interference effects in the Navon task, suggesting spared integration of both face and nonface information.

One such region, the V-4 complex of the rhesus monkey, is highly specialized for the analysis of color information, suggesting that a lesion in a homologous region might produce a defect in color vision while sparing other visual functions. We have studied a patient whose clinical syndrome supports this suggestion: a 44-year-old man with normal color vision suffered two cerebral infarctions that produced first a right and then a left superior homonymous quadrantanopia and also caused prosopagnosia, topographical disorientation, and severely impaired color vision. Computed tomography demonstrated extensive lesions in both inferior occipital lobes in the territories of the lateral branches of the posterior cerebral arteries, involving the lingual and medial occipitotemporal gyri bilaterally; these gyri contain the inferior portion of striate cortex and segments of extrastriate visual cortex. The patient had no difficulty in giving the correct color names associated with common objects presented either verbally or in outline drawings. Standardized testing with the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, the Nagel anomaloscope, and a method that tests for just-noticeable differences between monochromatic stimuli all showed that the patient's ability to distinguish one color from another was markedly imparied but not totally absent. In contrast, visual acuity, reading, visually guided eye movements, and stereopsis were normal. Cells in the V-4 complex of monkey extrastriate cortex are highly specialized for distinguishing one color from another; the hue discrimination deficit that was demonstrated in this patient with cerebral color blindness indicates that a region or regions with similar function has been damaged.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410050307,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

2290490,Recognition of unfamiliar faces in prosopagnosia.,"Davidoff, J; Landis, T",Davidoff,"Prosopagnosia is clinically defined as a specific and extreme inability to recognize familiar faces. However, doubts have been expressed concerning prosopagnosics' preserved ability to recognize unfamiliar faces and to make other within category discriminations. The present study pursues these doubts. If recognition of unfamiliar faces and objects is intact, then prosopagnosics should demonstrate normal processing for all tasks that depend on the possession of intact stored visual descriptions at the category level. In particular, they should show normal face and object superiority effects. A detailed investigation was carried out on a well documented prosopagnosic (KD) and less extensively on three other (RB, AH and OA) well attested cases. Experiments 1 and 2 considered whether face and object superiority effects were observed in these patients. No difference in the pattern of recognition performance was found between normal and unusual arrangements of faces and objects. Their pattern of performance differed both from unilateral brain-damaged patients and normal controls. The results suggest both that these prosopagnosic patients were impaired on the recognition of unfamiliar faces and that their problem is not specific to faces. Experiment 3 showed that KD was impaired on a face/non-face decision task but appeared to benefit by the stimulus being presented in the normal orientation. For normal controls, mental rotation of a face appeared to be a separate process from face categorization. Experiment 4 found that KD, AH and OA were impaired, compared to normal controls, in their ability to recognize emotional expressions but not more than brain-damaged controls. The impairment of the prosopagnosics tested in the present study is placed at the interaction between stored object descriptions and the structural encoding stage of Bruce and Young. Consideration is given to an elaboration of the structural encoding stage in which boundary (category defining) information is separately processed from surface (detailed texture) information.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(90)90051-o,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Patient WH, who suffered from semantic dementia, had severe naming and comprehension difficulties, with extremely sparse residual semantic knowledge. Remarkably, the category of countries was preserved. First, we argue that, for both patients, this category preservation occurs at a semantic level. Second, we discuss our findings in the context of three current models of category-specific effects (perceptual, ontogenetic, and evolutionary models). We argue that the perceptual model (Humphreys and colleagues) cannot easily accommodate our findings. By contrast, the ontogenetic (Warrington and colleagues) and evolutionary models (Caramazza and colleagues) can explain our findings. However, some modifications to both models are required. The ontogenetic model needs to envisage a spatial channel for the development of map knowledge, which is anatomically separate from channels of other categories of knowledge. The evolutionary model needs to envisage the possibility that some categories of knowledge, such as countries, may not be prewired, but learned during ontogenetic development.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490495186,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The patients reported so far have posterior lesions encompassing either or both the right inferior occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and exhibit a critical impairment in generating a sufficiently detailed holistic percept to individualize faces. Here, we extended these observations to include the prosopagnosic patient LR (Bukach, Bub, Gauthier, & Tarr, 2006), whose damage is restricted to the anterior region of the right temporal lobe. First, we report that LR is able to discriminate parametrically defined individual exemplars of nonface object categories as accurately and quickly as typical observers, which suggests that the visual similarity account of prosopagnosia does not explain his impairments. Then, we show that LR does not present with the typical face inversion effect, whole-part advantage, or composite face effect and, therefore, has impaired holistic perception of individual faces. Moreover, the patient is more impaired at matching faces when the facial part he fixates is masked than when it is selectively revealed by means of gaze contingency. Altogether these observations support the view that the nature of the critical face impairment does not differ qualitatively across patients with acquired prosopagnosia, regardless of the localization of brain damage: all these patients appear to be impaired to some extent at what constitutes the heart of our visual expertise with faces, namely holistic perception at a sufficiently fine-grained level of resolution to discriminate exemplars of the face class efficiently.

Although the findings reported here pertain to a patient exhibiting a rare neurologic consequence of closed head injury, the methods employed are applicable to subtle behavioral manifestations of diverse etiologies. Neurophyshological findings in a patient unable to recognize faces of familiar persons (prosopagnosia) disclosed a severe impairment of visual perception despite intact visual acuity and fields. The prosopagnosia was also associated with a pervasive memory deficit without dementia. Our results challenge current concepts of prosopagnosia and support the need for neuropsychological evaluation of post-traumatic patients.",{},,Diseases of the nervous system,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

27756661,Prosopagnosia Induced by a Left Anterior Temporal lobectomy Following a Right Temporo-occipital Resection in a Multicentric Diffuse Low-Grade Glioma.,"Corrivetti, Francesco; Herbet, Guillaume; Moritz-Gasser, Sylvie; Duffau, Hugues",Corrivetti,"Face recognition is a complex function sustained by a distributed large-scale neural network, with a core system involving the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the splenial commissural fibers. This circuit seems to be bilaterally organized, but with a right hemispheric dominance. According to this anatomic functional model, prosopagnosia is usually, but not exclusively, generated by a damage of the right part of this brain network. This report describes an original case of a multicentric diffuse low-grade glioma, with a right occipitotemporal tumor and a left anterior temporoinsular tumor. Awake surgery for the right occipitotemporal lesion, involving fusiform and inferior occipital gyri and ILF, was achieved in a first step without causing any neurologic deficit. A subsequent resection of the left anterior temporoinsular lesion, with removal of the anterior left ILF, was achieved 1 year later. Surprisingly, the patient experienced a strong and permanent prosopagnosia after this second surgery. The authors investigate the possible causes resulting in this prosopagnosia. Specifically, they suggest a decompensation within a reorganized neural network after the first operation, because of a disconnection syndrome induced by a bilateral surgical damage of the ventral occipitotemporal structural connectivity. These original data can be useful for neurosurgeons, especially when achieving resection for multicentric tumors involving both ventral streams, to inform patients before surgery about the possible risk of face recognition deficit, and to adapt the cognitive tasks intraoperatively during awake procedure.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.10.025,,Disconnection syndrome; Face recognition; Fusiform face area; Inferior longitudinal fascicle; Low-grade glioma; Prosopagnosia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

19334311,Structure and function in acquired prosopagnosia: lessons from a series of 10 patients with brain damage.,"Barton, Jason J S",Barton,"Acquired prosopagnosia varies in both behavioural manifestations and the location and extent of underlying lesions. We studied 10 patients with adult-onset lesions on a battery of face-processing tests. Using signal detection methods, we found that discriminative power for the familiarity of famous faces was most reduced by bilateral occipitotemporal lesions that involved the fusiform gyri, and better preserved with unilateral right-sided lesions. Tests of perception of facial structural configuration showed severe deficits with lesions that included the right fusiform gyrus, whether unilateral or bilateral. This deficit was most consistent for eye configuration, with some patients performing normally for mouth configuration. Patients with anterior temporal lesions had better configuration perception, though at least one patient showed a more subtle failure to integrate configural data from different facial regions. Facial imagery, an index of facial memories, was severely impaired by bilateral lesions that included the right anterior temporal lobe and marginally impaired by fusiform lesions alone; unilateral right fusiform lesions tended to spare imagery for facial features. These findings suggest that (I) prosopagnosia is more severe with bilateral than unilateral lesions, indicating a minor contribution of the left hemisphere to face recognition, (2) perception of facial configuration critically involves the right fusiform gyrus and (3) access to facial memories is most disrupted by bilateral lesions that also include the right anterior temporal lobe. This supports assertions that more apperceptive variants of prosopagnosia are linked to fusiform damage, whereas more associative variants are linked to anterior temporal damage. Next, we found that behavioural indices of covert recognition correlated with measures of overt familiarity, consistent with theories that covert behaviour emerges from the output of damaged neural networks, rather than alternative pathways. Finally, to probe the face specificity of the prosopagnosic defect, we tested recognition of fruits and vegetables: While face specificity was not found in most of our patients, the data of one patient suggested that this may be possible with more focal lesions of the right fusiform gyrus.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x214172,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

18374372,Prosopagnosia associated with a left occipitotemporal lesion.,"Barton, Jason J S",Barton,"Acquired prosopagnosia is usually associated with bilateral or right-sided lesions of the occipital or temporal lobes. In rare cases of prosopagnosia after left-sided lesions in left-handed subjects, it is attributed to a reversed hemispheric specialization for face processing. This study examines the face-processing functions of a left-handed prosopagnosic patient with a left-sided lesion affecting the region of the occipital face area and possibly the fusiform face area, to contrast his deficits with those of prosopagnosic patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Similar to those patients, he has a moderately severe reduction in familiarity judgments, is impaired in processing face configuration, and shares with some of those patients a greater failure to process eye than mouth information, indicating an altered pattern of facial saliency. He has a mild reduction in the identification of exemplars of non-face objects. Unlike those patients, he has better residual familiarity on a two-alternative forced-choice task and can processing facial configuration if given more time, indicating a reduction in efficiency rather than a severe limitation. He has more difficulty accessing semantic-biographic information from names. He has trouble with facial feature imagery but not imagery for global face shape. Thus this subject's deficits represent a combination of impaired familiarity and configuration processing (normally right-sided functions in right-handed subjects), and impaired feature processing and access to semantic-biographic information (normally left-sided functions). His prosopagnosia likely reflects partially anomalous rather than reversed lateralization of hemispheric perceptual functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.02.014,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Homonymous hemianopia (HH) has rarely been described in this syndrome. We report on six patients (four females, two males, aged 63 to 80) referred for visual disorder which led to demonstration of HH using perimetry testing. These patients were followed for 1 to 5 years after discovery of HH. Brain imaging with MRI or CT scan was obtained in the six cases and a SPECT scan was performed in four cases. HH was left-sided in four cases and right-sided in two cases. Associated symptoms related to higher visual dysfunction were simultagnosia, alone or as part of a full Balint's syndrome, alexia, constructional apraxia, dressing apraxia, visual form agnosia, prosopagnosia and hemispatial neglect. These symptoms were mild at onset but invariably worsened with disease progression. Dementia eventually developed in all cases. The clinical diagnosis was probable Alzheimer's disease in five cases and corticobasal degeneration in one case. Radiology showed posterior cortex atrophy in all cases as well as reduced cerebral blood flow in the same region, with an asymmetrical pattern compatible with the side of HH. Elementary cortical lesions in PCA can develop mainly in the associative visual areas and even in the primary visual area, resulting in HH. HH has rarely been documented in PCA, but its prevalence would probably be higher if systematic search was conducted. Apparently isolated HH of insidious onset should suggest PCA and lead to neuropsychological testing and search for discrete atrophic changes of the posterior cortex on MRI as well as for metabolic alterations with SPECT or PET.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2008.10.010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

Monkeys learned the task readily, but after bilateral removal of the banks and floor of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) they failed to perform the task efficiently. This result is consistent with the conclusion, based on recordings from single cells in awake, behaving monkeys [Perret et al., Physiological Aspects of Clinical Neuro-ophthalmology, Chapman & Hall, London, 1988] that this region of the temporal lobe is important for coding information about eye-gaze of a confronting animal. Human subjects were given identical stimuli in a task where they were asked to detect ""the face that is looking straight at you"". Human performance is sensitive to the degree of angular deviation from the frontal gaze position, being poorest at small angular deviations from 0 degrees. This was also true of monkeys viewing these stimuli, pre- and post-operatively. Compared with normal controls, two humans prosopagnosics were impaired at this task. However the extent of impairment was different in the two patients.

The other patient, with only a left-sided lesion, shows no deficits in face recognition nor in the classification of faces in terms of nonverbal messages, but is alexic and impaired at lipreading. It is argued that processing faces for verbal information (lipreading) and processing faces for nonverbal information (face recognition and interpretation of emotive and gestural messages) are functionally dissociated in the human brain. Theoretical interpretations of prosopagnosia that stress a perceptual component to all types of face recognition failure may therefore be misleading, for similar stimulus processing mechanisms are likely to be required to identify a speech sound from a face as to identify a nonverbal gesture of the mouth.

Here, we describe a 21-year-old right-handed woman with acute impairment in face recognition that selectively concerned unfamiliar faces, following a focal left lateral temporo-occipital venous infarct. She was severely impaired in discerning that unknown people seen in everyday life were unfamiliar, although she had no difficulty recognizing familiar people. Thus, she had no prosopagnosia, but abnormal 'hyperfamiliarity' for unknown faces. Her difficulty was not accompanied by delusions or deficits in discrimination, identification or memory for faces. Standard neuropsychological testing showed that her recognition of familiar faces was entirely normal. By contrast, her sense of personally knowing faces was severely impaired when unknown faces evoked weak signals of familiarity based on spurious cues, to the extent that she would misattribute fame to faces that were unknown but to which she had been incidentally exposed on a prior occasion. Priming experiments also revealed that, unlike normal subjects, she made familiarity judgements without accessing semantic identity representations. Moreover, in face recognition tests, she generally showed bias in that she relied more on right-hemisphere strategies to identify global traits and less on left-hemisphere processes compared with healthy subjects. This case provides novel evidence for a differential contribution of the two hemispheres to face recognition. Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces might arise from an imbalance between reciprocal hemispheric functions in face recognition, with relative hypoactivation of left hemisphere processes but hyperactivation of right-hemisphere processes for retrieving stored associations about people, linking seen faces to representations of affective and personal relevance. Hence, abnormal bias in attributing some personal meaning to unknown faces could be evoked by spurious signals of familiarity based on irrelevant affective associations in the right hemisphere.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awg086,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The patient showed impairment of fundamental visual and visuospatial recognition, such as in object size, configuration, and horizontal point location, which probably underlay the mechanism of simultanagnosia and prosopagnosia. This case also suggests that the coexistence of simultanagnosia and prosopagnosia results from a right hemispheric insult, and damage to the temporoparietal area interrupts the incorporation of spatial information into object recognition. This disconnection of information flow, together with impaired object recognition per se, may impair the parallel processing of multiple objects, leading to object-by-object or part-by-part recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2015.1066827,,prosopagnosia for unfamiliar faces; prosopamnesia; simultanagnosia; spatial agraphia; superior temporal sulcus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/4.5.555,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

He did not have topographical agnosia or object agnosia. He regained the ability to recognize faces of familiar persons, whereas he remained unable to identify faces of persons whom he met after the disease onset. This case demonstrates that prosopagnosia may occur as a deficit of matching a perceived face to a memory store of the face, and that the failure to recognize unfamiliar faces may be due to the inability to form memory stores of new faces. These deficits can occur in association with a lesion confined to the right occipitotemporal region.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00919707,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

In order to define the nature of this agnosia, we studied a patient with isolated topographic disorientation (TD) after a stroke in the right medial occipitotemporal region. The patient got lost in familiar environments but could readily read and draw maps, describe familiar routes, and provide correct directions. He had normal perceptual test performance and met criteria for topographagnosia rather than for other forms of topographic disorientation. Two ecologically valid route tests assessed the nature of his agnosia. On a familiar route, he could recognize major landmarks. He could not, however, recognize route configurations made up of combinations of visual features each lacking individual distinctiveness. On a test of route learning, he learned landmarks that differed in minor details and could use them to orient himself along a route. He had difficulty, however, recognizing and learning scenes lacking salient landmarks. This agnosia for scenes was worse for semantically-related environments, but improved with semantic knowledge such as street names. In addition, the patient lacked overt prosopagnosia but tended toward semantic errors in the recognition of famous faces. Together these findings suggest that this patient's inability to recognize a route resulted from an inability of intact perceptual units for scenes, composed of specific visual configurations of individually indefinite features, from accessing stored representations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00041-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Functional imaging demonstrated that like our control observers, D.F. shows significantly more activation when passively viewing face compared to scene images in an area that is consistent with the fusiform face area (FFA) (p < 0.01). Control observers also show occipital face area (OFA) activation; however, whereas D.F.'s lesions appear to overlap the OFA bilaterally. We asked, given that D.F. shows FFA activation for faces, to what extent is she able to recognize faces? D.F. demonstrated a severe impairment in higher level face processing--she could not recognize face identity, gender or emotional expression. In contrast, she performed relatively normally on many face categorization tasks. D.F. can differentiate faces from non-faces given sufficient texture information and processing time, and she can do this is independent of color and illumination information. D.F. can use configural information for categorizing faces when they are presented in an upright but not a sideways orientation and given that she also cannot discriminate half-faces she may rely on a spatially symmetric feature arrangement. Faces appear to be a unique category, which she can classify even when she has no advance knowledge that she will be shown face images. Together, these imaging and behavioral data support the importance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face identification, including more than just the FFA--in particular the OFA, a region believed to be associated with low-level processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.013,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

He initially presented with excessive use of pronouns and semantic paraphasia at the age of 55 years. Impairment of object recognition developed 5 years after the onset. Face recognition impairment and stereotypic behaviors developed 11 years after onset, and pyramidal signs 2 years before death. Pathological examination disclosed circumscribed severe atrophy in not only the bilateral temporal tips but also in the left precentral gyrus and pars opercularis in a motor speech field. Pyramidal tract involvement and loss of Betz cells were also evident. On the other hand, neurons in the anterior horns and hypoglossal nuclei were spared in number, although astrocytes were mildly proliferated. Ubiquitin-positive lesions were observed in the hippocampus, and frontal and temporal cortices. Neither Bunina bodies nor Pick bodies were present. These features clinically fit the international diagnostic criteria of semantic dementia and, histopathologically, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). This case suggests that (1) the distribution of cortical lesions associated with language disturbance is not uniform in FTLD-MND. It may be that only some cases of FTLD with ubiquitin pathology develop semantic dementia despite the high incidence of language disturbance, and (2) the precentral gyrus can be severely affected in FTLD-MND. After reviewing previous cases of FTLD-MND with a clinical course of more than 10 years, we also noticed that (3) FTLD-MND cases with a long disease duration often show upper motor neuron-predominant involvement.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Acta neuropathologica,10.1007/s00401-006-0149-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Cerebral MRI showed an infarct involving the ventral structures of the left hemisphere sparing the splenium of the corpus callosum and the thalamus. Neuropsychological examination revealed that the patient easily identified the objects, the animals and the famous places he could not name: his comments attested normal visual recognition. Conversely, when he was presented with famous faces, he always had a strong feeling of familiarity, but could not provide accurate information about the corresponding individual. Biographic information about personalities was not impaired in the semantic-biographic store, because it could be accessed from the names. Activation of face recognition units (where the visual description provided by the structural encoding and the stored sets of descriptions of familiar faces are compared), was effective, since the patient could distinguish famous faces from unknown ones. In a modular-sequential model of face recognition, this deficit is interpreted as a disconnection between face recognition units and person identity nodes (which are considered to contain semantic-biographic information about individuals). This kind of disturbance differs from classic prosopagnosia in which, characteristically, the patients are unable to experience a feeling of familiarity when viewing famous faces, and to perform a categorization between famous and unknown faces. Right hemisphere has a preponderant role in structural analysis of faces and in activation of face recognition units. The integrity of this hemisphere in this patient could explain the preservation of these two steps of processing. Left-hemisphere specific function in facial recognition enabled access to semantic-biographic store in a conscious, verbal and explicit way, after the right hemisphere had achieved basic visual analysis and activation of facial representation in memory. We compare the cognitive impairment in our patient to those encountered in classical prosopagnosic patients. This case illustrates the validity of the modular-sequential model considered. In addition it throws a light on the poor-known role of the left hemisphere in face recognition.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Recent claims, however, have asserted that associative agnosia is also characterized by deficits at the perceptual level, which are too subtle to be detected by current neuropsychological tests. Thus, the impaired identification of famous faces or common objects in associative agnosia stems from difficulties in extracting the minute perceptual details required to identify a face or an object. In the present study, we report the case of a patient DBO with a left occipital infarct, who shows impaired object and famous face recognition. Despite his disability, he exhibits a face inversion effect, and is able to select a famous face from among non-famous distractors. In addition, his performance is normal in an immediate and delayed recognition memory for faces, whose external features were deleted. His deficits in face recognition are apparent only when he is required to name a famous face, or select two faces from among a triad of famous figures based on their semantic relationships (a task which does not require access to names). The nature of his deficits in object perception and recognition are similar to his impairments in the face domain. This pattern of behavior supports the notion that apperceptive and associative agnosia reflect distinct and dissociated deficits, which result from damage to different stages of the face and object recognition process.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.01.003,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or inappropriate vasopressin secretion. Only severe vomiting, corrected by water intake, could explain the hyponatremia. The first MRI showed bitemporal edema; 3 months later it showed large bitemporal lesions, both internal and external, with atrophy of the hippocampus and limbic system. These MRI findings are characteristic of KBS. To our knowledge, this is the only the second case of KBS with bitemporal myelinolysis reported related to excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (increase of 30 mmol/L over 36 h), which leads more usually to central pontine myelinolysis.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",10.1016/j.lpm.2007.08.021,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,eng
19589510,Impaired processing of relative distances between features and of the eye region in acquired prosopagnosia--two sides of the same holistic coin?,"Ramon, Meike; Rossion, Bruno",Ramon,"Acquired prosopagnosia (AP) is characterized by impaired recognition of individual faces following brain damage. The nature of the functional impairment(s) underlying AP remains debated. Recent studies have demonstrated deficient processing of diagnostic information in the region of the eyes (Caldara et al., 2005); other studies suggest that patients fail to judge relative distances between facial features (Barton et al., 2002). We hypothesized that these apparently different observations are related to a common cause. More precisely, we suggest that AP arises due to an impairment of a process that reduces uncertainty about the nature/location of the diagnostic cues for face individualization: the ability to perceive multiple elements of a face as a single global representation (holistic processing). Being impaired at processing individual faces holistically, prosopagnosic patients would tend to perform relatively worse for processing facial areas containing multiple elements (i.e., the eyes), and for elements that are widely spaced apart. Here we tested PS, a single case of AP, at matching unfamiliar faces differing either with respect to local features or inter-feature distances, over the upper and lower areas of the face. A pilot study and Experiment 1 confirmed that PS was extremely poor at using information encompassing the eyes, but was also deficient at perceiving relative distances between features. When uncertainty about the location and nature of the diagnostic cue was removed in Experiment 2, PS' performance remained below normal range, but she improved substantially. Most interestingly, her pattern of performance across the different conditions appeared qualitatively identical to that of normal controls. In line with previous observations of PS and other cases of prosopagnosia, our findings indicate that the reduced reliance on the area of the eyes and on relative distances between features in AP may have a common underlying cause-the disruption of holistic processing of the individual face.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2009.06.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

14707313,Visual command hallucinations in a patient with pure alexia.,"Ffytche, D H; Lappin, J M; Philpot, M",Ffytche,"Around 25% of patients with visual hallucinations secondary to eye disease report hallucinations of text. The hallucinated text conveys little if any meaning, typically consisting of individual letters, words, or nonsense letter strings (orthographic hallucinations). A patient is described with textual visual hallucinations of a very different linguistic content following bilateral occipito-temporal infarcts. The hallucinations consisted of grammatically correct, meaningful written sentences or phrases, often in the second person and with a threatening and command-like nature (syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations). A detailed phenomenological interview and visual psychophysical testing were undertaken. The patient showed a classical ventral occipito-temporal syndrome with achromatopsia, prosopagnosia, and associative visual agnosia. Of particular significance was the presence of pure alexia. Illusions of colour induced by monochromatic gratings and a novel motion-direction illusion were also observed, both consistent with the residual capacities of the patient's spared visual cortex. The content of orthographic visual hallucinations matches the known specialisations of an area in the left posterior fusiform gyrus--the visual word form area (VWFA)--suggesting the two are related. The VWFA is unlikely to be responsible for the syntacto-semantic hallucinations described here as the patient had a pure alexic syndrome, a known consequence of VWFA lesions. Syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations may represent a separate category of textual hallucinations related to the cortical network implicated in the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",,PMC1757477,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

To determine whether the prosopagnosic deficit in perceiving spatial configuration was specific to within-face and not between-face spatial coding and whether the deficit was face-selective or extended to objects other than faces. Six prosopagnosic patients were tested using an oddity paradigm in which they detected which of three simultaneously seen stimuli was an altered target. In the ""within-face"" task, the target face had altered interocular distance or mouth position. In the ""between-face"" task, the target face was located farther away from the other two. In the ""within-object"" task, the stimulus was a two-dot pattern, and the target pattern had altered interdot distance. Spatial judgments were impaired within faces for all six patients and within the two-dot pattern for five of six patients. However, all six had normal between-face spatial perception. Impaired perception of spatial relations in prosopagnosia is selective to the spatial structure within individual objects and spares the perception of spatial location of objects. It is not specific to faces. It reveals a process involved in analyzing object structure, consistent with the patients' deficits in recognizing facial identity, and illustrates a different type of ""visuospatial"" defect.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/01.wnl.0000168901.98616.1c,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

The third patient has a normal feeling of knowing, could distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar faces, but was unable to evoke any biographical information about the personalities. Prosopagnosic patients demonstrated, in an experimental condition of learning face-name pairs, implicit knowledge. We assume that these capacities were dependent of the activation of networks coding familiar faces in memory. Mental imagery of faces were normal in theses two cases. In addition, stimulation of mental imagery in the first patient improved implicit knowledge in forced choice tasks. These cases throws a light on the respective role of each hemisphere in face recognition. The right hemisphere is advantaged in perceptual analysis, and activates, from the perceived faces, mnestic systems which codes for previously encountered faces. It generates feeling of familiarity, probably by the way of specific systems which differs from, and completes, those allowing identification.

Whole faces (Experiment 1), or face parts (Experiment 2), were presented in upright and inverted orientations. Compared to the control, HJA was severely impaired at matching whole faces, but he improved dramatically when face parts were presented in isolation. This suggests an inhibitory influence of face context on HJAs processing of local parts and a relatively intact ability to process part-based information from a face (when context cannot interfere). Face inversion did not affect HJAs performance. A control experiment (Experiment 3) with non-face stimuli (houses) suggested that the inhibitory influence of context on HJAs performance was restricted to faces.

He was started on oral S-1 (TS-1) combined with intrathecal methotrexate injection using the VP shunt reservoir. In two weeks, headache and hearing loss completely disappeared and gait disturbances started to improve. CSF findings also improved remarkably with disappearance of neoplastic cells and almost normalization of CEA. For the next five months, he was well on oral S-1 and monthly intrathecal chemotherapy, being able to walk using a walker and to stay at home. He subsequently developed posterior cortical symptoms such as prosopagnosia and cortical blindness and gradually lapsed into coma. He died from pneumonia one year after the onset of neurological symptoms. At autopsy, primary gastric cancer was found but much reduced in size. No peritoneal metastasis could be found. In the brain, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis involved the occipital lobes, the base of the temporal lobe, and the cerebellum. We suggest that intrathecal chemotherapy using ventriculoperitoneal shunt with programmable valve system could be an effective method for the treatment of meningeal carcinomatosis.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

A patient is presented, whose initial complaint was blurred vision. Relentless progression over a period of seven months to left hemianopsia, prosopagnosia, alexia with agraphia and eventually cortical blindness was observed. Accompanying the visual impairment was a steady deterioration of mental function. Sequential computerized axial tomography defined low density lesions in the occipital white matter with sparing of the cortical ribbon. As hemianopsia progressed to cortical blindness, the scans confirmed the evolution of bilaterial occipital lesions. The diagnosis was made clinically and established on histological and cultural grounds. Computerized tomography seems to be valuable in diagnosis and monitoring progress of PML.",{},,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger

559259,Alexia without agraphia in a left-handed patient with prosopagnosia.,"Aptman, M; Levin, H; Senelick, R C",Aptman,"A left-handed patient was studied who had the acute onset of alexia without agraphia, a left homonymous hemianopia, and prosopagnosia. Neurodiagnostic tests including computerized axial tomography and angiography disclosed bilateral lesions in the posterior cerebral hemispheres involving the splenium of the corpus callosum. Neuropsychologic examination indicated marked impairment of facial discrimination, deficient naming and memory of presented visual material, and mild visual agnosia with relative preservation of other cognitive functions. These findings are consistent with a double disconnection syndrome involving disconnection of the dominant angular gyrus and right inferotemporal cortex from their bilateral visual inputs.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.27.6.533,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
9493202,[A patient with amnesic syndrome with defective route finding due to left posterior cerebral artery territory infarction].,"Sato, K; Sakajiri, K; Komai, K; Takamori, M",Sato,"We report a right-handed 67-year-old woman with an infarction in the left posterior cerebral artery territory presenting amnesic syndrome, right homonymous hemianopsia, pure alexia, color anomia, and defective route finding. The patient often walked in wrong directions out of her hospital room as well as in her home. She was able to recognize her own house and nearby streets by looking at them. Prosopagnosia and constructional impairment was not observed. Wechsler memory scale revised (WMS-R) revealed that she had marked disturbance in both visual and verbal recent memory. Brain MRI revealed an infarction involving the left medial inferior temporal and left medial occipital lobe, the left splenium of corpus callosum, and the left retrosplenial region. SPECT indicated a defect in the left medial occipital lobe and hypoperfusion in the left medial temporal lobe. Cerebral angiography demonstrated stenosis of the left medial occipital artery and occlusion of the left dorsal corpus callosal branches and the left calcarine artery. We conclude that left hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus and the left retrosplenial region may cause memory disturbance in our case. The lesion in the left retrosplenial region may have contributed to the occurrence of defective route finding. The relation between defective route finding and the retrosplenial amnesia is discussed.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

1301317,[Visual agnosia evolving to optic aphasia--a case study].,"Matsuda, M; Nakamura, K; Fujimoto, N; Nabatame, H; Kido, N",Matsuda,"The underlying mechanism of visual agnosia and optic aphasia has not been fully elucidated, although a number of hypotheses have been proposed. Besides, the difference between these two conditions has been a matter of debate. We report here the result of neuropsychological evaluation in a case of associative visual agnosia evolving to optic aphasia. A 64-year-old right-handed patient was found to be disoriented and confused after undergoing the operation of gastrectomy. CT scan revealed a large infarction in the territory of left posterior cerebral artery. Since 3 weeks after onset, neuropsychological investigations were carried out during 5 months. He was alert and co-operative. Right homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing was noted, but his visual acuity was normal. There was neither a global deterioration of intellectual capacities nor aphasia. Most striking finding was his difficulty in identifying common objects and colours along with a profound alexia. Prosopagnosia was absent. Visual naming both for objects and line drawings was severely impaired. He was unable to describe or demonstrate the use of the objects which could not be named. Pointing to objects named by the examiner was also severely impaired. Although tactile naming was also impaired, both of auditory naming for environmental sounds and naming objects in response to verbal descriptions were preserved. While he was not able to copy the objects skillfully, matching of identical objects and matching objects to line drawings were normal. Clumsiness of coping was thought to be due to his constructional apraxia and visuomotor ataxia. Therefore, his deficit in visual domain was considered to be associative visual agnosia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
11257784,[A case of agnosia for streets and houses unaccompanied by prosopagnosia of familiar faces due to the right occipital lobe infarction].,"Ohra, S; Otsuki, M; Omura, E; Terai, T; Nagatsuka, K; Naritomi, H",Ohra,"We reported a patient who showed agnosia for streets and homes unaccompanied by prosopagnosia of familiar faces following infarction in the right occipital lobe. A 70-years-old right-handed man admitted to our department because of sudden development of visual impairment. He had left hemianopsia, left unilateral spatial neglect and slight visual memory disturbance but no other neurological abnormalities. His verbal memory was maintained intact. He was, however, unable to distinguish the sceneries of buildings and streets regardless of their familiarities and often got lost in the hospital. His topographical abilities in map-sketching and route-description were partially impaired depending upon the familiarity of targets; the disability was observed toward unfamiliar targets. His ability in facial recognition was also partially impaired depending upon the familiarity of persons. The patient was unable to distinguish faces of unfamiliar persons, such as nurses and doctors whom he met following stroke, whereas he was able to distinguish faces of familiar persons, such as his family and friends. The brain MRI demonstrated infarction in the right medial occipital lobe including parahippocampal gyrus, lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus. In general, the manifestation of agnosia for streets and houses is associated with prosopagnosia. The present case, however, exhibited only the former in association with the partial manifestation of the latter. The fact suggests that those two are independent syndromes. The present case also showed a dissociation in the abilities of topographical and facial recognition according to the familiarity of targets. The process for the retrieval and reference of acquired information and that for the acquirement of new visual information may work in an independent manner.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

During the attack, both color naming and color pointing were severely disturbed, while he could correctly state the colors of named objects. There were no additional neuropsychological disturbances such as aphasia, alexia and prosopagnosia. Brain MRI revealed a new ischemic change, i.e. laminar cortical necrosis, in the right fusiform gyrus as a causative lesion as well as old asymptomatic infarcts in the left middle cerebral arterial territory. Cardioembolism was considered to be responsible for the development of brain ischemia. The transient achromatopsia is a rarely reported disease and this case appears to support 'ischemia' as its etiology.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
