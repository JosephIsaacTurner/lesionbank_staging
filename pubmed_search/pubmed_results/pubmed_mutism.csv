A 77-year old lady presented with apparent unresponsiveness. In fact she responded when stimulated. She subsequently developed movements typical of clonic perseveration, erroneously treated as seizures. She also had features of a frontal lobe syndrome. Initial CT scan showed no abnormality; it was only after an MRI scan that a diagnosis of bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction was made.

David sustained a stroke following a middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombus. A CT scan at the time detected old ischaemic infarcts affecting the right frontal lobe, the left occipital lobe and the left parietal lobe so David had bilateral brain damage. Initially thought to have a DOC, further neuropsychological assessments administered when David had improved a little, resulted in the diagnosis of AM. Although David spoke little, when he did speak, his words and phrases were well articulated, grammatical and with appropriate intonation. He was alert and visually aware and he was not paralysed. We discuss whether the diagnosis was correct and address the difficulties in assessing such patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2017.1281147,,Akinetic mutism; differential diagnosis; neuropsychological assessments,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
38102824,Ischemic Stroke During Dengue Infection: A Report of 2 Cases.,"Restrepo, Berta Nelly; Marin Velasquez, Katerine; Herrera Marín, Natalia; Arango-Jaramillo, Esteban; Aristizábal Gómez, Andrés Santiago",Restrepo,"BACKGROUND Involvement of the central nervous system during infection with dengue virus (DENV) is recognized. However, ischemic stroke is rarely reported. Herein are described 2 cases of patients with ischemic stroke in which DENV infection was demonstrated. CASE REPORT The first patient was a 51-year-old woman that presented altered consciousness, monoparesis, facial palsy, dysarthria, Babinski sign, and syncope 7 days from the onset of fever. She had a history of carotid artery atherothrombosis and previous stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an acute infarction of the right middle cerebral artery. DENV was confirmed by the presence of NS1 and IgM in serum. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and recovered well, with only right facial paresis still present at discharge. The second patient was a 50-year-old man who presented with headache, altered consciousness, and mutism after a febrile episode 1 week prior. This patient had a previous history of stroke, glioblastoma resection, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and diabetes. MRI demonstrated a subacute ischemic event. The diagnosis of dengue was confirmed by serum NS1 and IgM and by RT-PCR in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. DENV-1 serotype was observed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids and was discharged in good condition. In both patients, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia was demonstrated, and hemoconcentration was demonstrated in the second patient. CONCLUSIONS In tropical and subtropical countries, DENV infection can represent a potential cause of ischemic stroke in patients with a history of comorbidities, including stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.941426,PMC10740333,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
24761599,Recovery of consciousness: process-oriented approach.,"Gusarova, S B",Gusarova,"Traditionally psychological neurorehabilitation of neurosurgical patients is provided subject to availability of clear consciousness and minimal potential to communicate verbally. Cognitive and emotional disorders, problems in social adaptation, neurotic syndromes are normally targets in such cases. We work with patients having survived severe brain damage being in different states of consciousness: vegetative state, minimal state of consciousness, mutism, confusion, posttraumatic Korsaroff syndrom. Psychologist considers recovery of consciousness as the target besides traditional tasks. Construction of communication with patient is central part of such job, where the patient remains unable to contact verbally, yet it is impossible to consider potential aphasia. This is a non-verbal ""dialogue"" with patient created by psychologist with gradual development and involving other people and objects of environment. Inline with modern neuroscientific achievements demonstrating ability to recognize by patients with severe brain injury (A. Owen, S. Laureys, M. Monti, M. Coleman, A. Soddu, M. Boly and others) we base upon psychological science, on psychotherapeutic approaches containing instruments inevitable to work with patients in altered states of consciousness and creation of non-verbal communication with patient (Jung, Reich, Alexander, Lowen, Keleman, Arnold and Amy Mindell, S.

34540210,Hyperleukocytosis-induced stroke and tonsillar herniation: Case report.,"Hashem, Hasan; Muhsen, Baha'eddin A",Hashem,"and Importance: Acute ischemic stroke is a rare event in children with leukemia, yet with long-term morbidity, substantial health, and economic cost. Central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement and chemotherapy-related stroke are the most common causes. Hyperleukocytosis induced stroke is very rarely reported. A 2-year-old male child presented with hyperleukocytosis (leukocyte count was 320x10<sup>9</sup>/L). Bone marrow evaluation revealed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He was treated with dexamethasone, vincristine and daunorubicin, and on day 4 of chemotherapy, he developed abnormal movements, altered mental status, limb weakness and mutism. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multifocal infarctions involving left pons and both cerebellar hemispheres causing tonsillar herniation with restricted diffusion and mild hydrocephalus but no leptomeningeal enhancement or leukemic infiltrates. Magnetic resonance angiography did not show any arterial stenosis. He was intubated, sedated and managed conservatively with dexamethasone. Cytologic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed no blasts. Thrombophilia work up was negative. Five weeks later, the patient had significant improvement in overall neurologic status. He is free of leukemia. MRI showed interval resolution of previous infarcts. Hyperviscosity secondary to hyperleukocytosis was considered to be the most likely explanation for this patient stroke after excluding thrombophilia and leukemic infiltration. Prompt management with hydration and careful chemotherapy resulted in good outcome in our patient. This case demonstrate the value of early recognition and prompt management of posterior circulation ischemic stroke in children with leukemia and hyperleukocytosis at presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102776,PMC8441068,Hyperleukocytosis; Hyperviscosity; Ischemic stroke; Leukemia; Tonsillar herniation,Case Reports,England,eng

To the best of our knowledge, only five cases have thus far been described in the English literature. In this paper, we report the sixth incidence overall, which is also the first case of a CM associated with penetrating head injury. The relevant literature is reviewed and analyzed, our current knowledge of the neuroanatomical and functional relations is summarized, and potential future research endeavors are indicated. An 8-year-old girl was transferred to our hospital having had fallen on a rod that penetrated her neck behind the ear. An urgent computed tomography scan of the head revealed a right cerebellar contusion with surrounding edema. Three days later, she became mute but was still obeying commands. Repeat imaging showed a resolving cerebellar contusion with increased edema and mass effect. By day 9, she had uttered a few words. At 1-month follow-up, the child had regained normal speech. Posttraumatic CM is a rare and probably underreported condition with only six documented cases to date. Although it may well be on the same spectrum as postoperative CM, further understanding of the exact mechanism, clinical course, and prognosis of this entity is bound to significantly improve the recovery and quality of life of head trauma patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_307_2021,PMC8492424,Cerebellar mutism; Head trauma; Penetrating traumatic brain injuries,Case Reports,United States,eng

It is commonly documented in patients with diagnosed primary dystonic syndromes or secondary dystonic states (i.e., patients with inborn errors of metabolism, dystonic cerebral palsy, Wilson's disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and exposure to drugs). However, viral-induced dystonic storm cases have rarely been reported. We describe the case of an 11-year-old girl from rural West Bengal (India) with a dystonic storm after Japanese encephalitis. Generalized dystonic spasms lasted for about 10-20 minutes and occurred 20-30 times/day. They were associated with extreme pain, fever, exhaustion, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, pupillary dilatation, arterial hypertension, and mutism and were precipitated by a full bladder and relieved somewhat during sleep. When dystonic spasms abated, she had high-grade generalized rigidity of all four limbs and fixed cervical and truncal dystonia. She was put on invasive ventilation and deep intravenous sedation with continuous midazolam infusion and other supportive measures and had a good clinical recovery. During the 12 months of follow-up, she did not have any other episode of a dystonic storm. However, axial rigidity and intermittent appendicular (upper limb) dystonic posturing were observed.

A 56-year-old male with a closed head injury was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) with GCS=4 (V1, M2, E1). Computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed a limited subarachnoid haemorrhage in the sylvian region without any brain oedema or ventricular shift. The GCS did not change until day 6. At the same time EEG showed a reactivity to acoustic stimuli consisting in the paradoxical appearance of a posterior rhythm in alpha range (10-12c/s), blocked by passive eye opening. Early cortical components (N20-P25) of somatosensory evoked potentials were normal on both hemispheres; middle components were also clearly evident. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed both diffuse and midbrain axonal injuries, particularly in a strategic lesion involving both cerebral peduncles. Event related potentials showed N2 and P3 components to stimulation by rare tones. A comprehensive multimodal neurophysiological approach, using the more informative tests and the proper time of recording, should be included in protocols for patients with severe head trauma, in order to establish the actual patient's clinical state and to avoid that a locked-in syndrome state be mistaken for prolonged coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state or akinetic mutism.

Manifestations of DPHL are diverse and include dementia, gait disturbance, incontinence, pyramidal tract signs, parkinsonism, chorea, mood and thought disorders, akinetic mutism, and rarely catatonia. We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL. The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL. No treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psychotropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT. There are 7 case reports of neurologic decompensation during ECT treatment after a cerebral hypoxic event. Caution is advised when considering ECT for catatonia when delayed sequelae of cerebral hypoxia are on the differential diagnosis, as there is a dearth of evidence to support this treatment approach.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Psychosomatics,10.1016/j.psym.2014.03.010,PMC4182149,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

DTHL is characterized by initial recovery from toxic exposure and cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, clinical stability over a few weeks, and subsequent neurological deterioration with the sudden emergence of diffuse white matter disease. A 46-year-old man suffered respiratory failure and hypotension as a result of opioid overdose. Brain MRI showed watershed infarcts and EEG showed diffuse theta-delta slowing consistent with global cerebral hypoperfusion. He recovered fully and was discharged with intact cognitive function. Three weeks later, he presented with abulia and psychomotor retardation. MRI revealed extensive white matter hyperintensity and EEG showed diffuse polymorphic delta activity. DTHL was diagnosed based on classic MRI features, history of opioid overdose and hypoxic brain injury, and negative test results for etiology of white matter disease. He developed akinetic mutism prompting administration of methylprednisolone 1000-mg IV q24h for five days. He also received amantadine 100-mg PO q12h. His cognition, motivation, and psychomotor function slowly improved and returned to baseline about two months after the overdose. Clinic reassessment two and a half months after the overdose revealed normal cognitive function, slight residual MRI hyperintensity, and mild EEG slowing anteriorly.

Beside anti-epileptic drugs he was treated with escalating immunotherapy (intravenous solumedrol then immunoglobulins then full rituximab course). Six months later, EEG combined to FDG-PET scan were repeated, and were normal. At 3 years follow up the patient remains neurologically stable and seizure-free, off anti-epileptics drugs. Performing the FDGPET scan combined to EEG was useful to identify non-convulsive status epilepticus and should be performed early in anti-NMDAR encephalitis to guide treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2021.09.036,PMC8523870,"Anti–NMDAR encephalitis; FDG-PET scan; Ictal PET scan, Neuroimaging; Mutism; Status epilepticus",Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

Herein, we report a case of a 66-year-old Japanese woman who presented with apraxia of the right hand. She subsequently developed postural instability and cognitive impairments that rapidly worsened. One and a half years later, the patient was wheelchair-bound and severely demented. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed left dominant atrophy of the frontoparietal lobe. There was a hyperintense lesion in the deep white matter expanding toward the subcortical area on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. In order to rule out the possibility of an intracranial tumor such as an astrocytoma or malignant lymphoma, we performed a brain biopsy of the left frontal middle gyrus. The patient became bedridden and showed akinetic mutism 1 year after biopsy. Pathological examination revealed a large amount of 4-repeat tau-immunoreactive neuropil threads scattered predominantly in the corticomedullary junction and tau-immunoreactive structures, consistent with CBD. Immunostaining for p53 showed no positive cells, and there were very few Ki-67-positive cells. On immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts, a major doublet of 64 and 68 kDa full-length tau with two closely related fragments of approximately 37 kDa were detected. Based on these results, the patient was pathologically diagnosed as having CBD, excluding the possibility of tumor. Taken together with previous similar case reports, our findings indicate that a deep white matter hyperintense lesion on FLAIR images may be a useful clue to CBD, predicting rapid clinical progression with severe dementia based on severe white matter degeneration with a large amount of tau accumulation on pathological examination.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12638,,dementia; frontotemporal dementia; neuropil threads; tau proteins; white matter,Case Reports,Australia,eng
34567396,Recognizing Aphemia and How to Differentiate From Aphasia in the Era of Telemedicine.,"Kasturiarachi, Brittany M; Krishnaiah, Balaji",Kasturiarachi,"Aphemia, or pure motor mutism, is a phenomenon that has been reported previously in the literature and typically is associated with small infarcts in the inferior dominant precentral gyrus, pars opercularis, or inferior perirolandic gyrus. Clinically, it is important to distinguish aphemia from aphasia syndromes. Telemedicine is becoming more prevalent and involving neurologists across the country. This is an important consideration when addressing aphemic patients as many mistakes can be made during a virtual exam clouding a patient's clinical picture. Our patient is a 61-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and an old right frontoparietal stroke without any residual deficits. She presented after her family stated that she ""quit speaking"" for about seven hours. Initial neurological evaluation was done via telemedicine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was pertinent for decreased consciousness, inability to answer either orientation question, a right facial droop, and aphasia. Later it was found that the patient exhibited a pure motor mutism rather than aphasia and had an MRI lesion in the left inferior precentral gyrus. Differentiating aphemia from aphasia is an important clinical skill for a neurologist to foster especially in the era of telemedicine. An intimate knowledge of the parts of a speech exam are vital in directing emergency staff during stroke evaluation. Additionally, distinguishing these clinical syndromes has implications with respect to prognosis and long-term rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The Neurohospitalist,10.1177/1941874421990546,PMC8442164,aphasia; apraxia; clinical neurology examination; infarction; telemedicine,Case Reports,United States,eng

We review the literature on SMA somatotopy and the prognostic abilities of intraoperative motor evoked potentials in suspected SMA dysfunction. A 45-year-old male underwent staged resection of a complex parasagittal WHO grade II meningioma involving the posterior superior frontal gyrus bilaterally. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring with transcranial motor evoked potentials (TCMEP) and direct cortical motor evoked potentials (DCMEP) were used during both stages of resection. The patient developed an isolated left foot drop despite unchanged DCMEP and TCMEP data obtained during the first stage of the procedure. During the second stage of resection 3 days later, repeat neurophysiological monitoring confirmed intact corticospinal tracts. Deep peroneal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) revealed good morphology, appropriate latency and amplitudes during the second stage of resection. These results suggested a diagnosis of focal SMA dysfunction. Left foot drop persisted 7 days post-operatively. At one month follow up, the patient was neurologically intact with full strength noted in all muscle groups of the left lower extremity. An improved understanding of the somatotopic organization of the SMA with additional neuromonitoring data can allow neurosurgeons to better predict and understand perioperative SMA dysfunctions.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The Neurodiagnostic journal,10.1080/21646821.2021.1991716,,Isolated foot drop; SMA syndrome; motor evoked potentials (MEP); postoperative deficit; supplementary motor area (SMA),Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Direct damage to parenchyma or scarification of the major vessels during an operation are the main causes. However, it is rarely reported as a postoperative complication in extra-axial tumors. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We reviewed 11 reported cases of supplementary motor area syndrome after removal of extra-axial meningiomas in the English literature from the PubMed database. We also added our case, which presented as an unusual huge meningioma, to analyze the clinical parameters and outcomes of these 12 reported cases. <i>Results</i>: Recovery time of supplementary motor area syndrome in extra-axial tumors could be within 1-7 weeks, shorter than intra-axial tumors (2-9 weeks). Epilepsy and progressive limb weakness are the most common presentations in 50% of cases. Different degrees of postoperative muscle power deterioration were noted in the first 48 h (from 0-4). Lower limbs (66.6%, 8/12) were slightly predominant compared to upper limbs (58.3%, 7/12). Mutism aphasia was also observed in 41.6% (5/12, including our case), and occurred in tumors which were involved in the dominant side; this recovered faster than limb weakness. <i>Discussion and Conclusions</i>: Our work indicated that SMA syndrome could occur in extra-axial brain tumors presenting as mutism aphasia and limb weakness without any direct brain parenchyma damage. In our analysis, we found that recovery time of postoperative motor function deficit could be within 1-7 weeks. Our study also provides a further insight of SMA syndrome in extra-axial brain tumors.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58081126,PMC9414816,epilepsy; extra-axial tumor; mutism aphasia; parasagittal meningioma; supplementary motor area syndrome,Case Reports; Review,Switzerland,eng

It is involved in self-initiated motor movements, planning and sequencing the motor action, response inhibition, and bimanual movements. Blood supply for supplementary motor area is mostly by callosomarginal branch of anterior cerebral artery. Stroke in anterior cerebral artery territory is relatively uncommon, moreover, isolated supplementary motor area stroke is a rare entity. Supplementary motor area stroke, as a syndrome, has variable symptoms consisting of impairment of volitional movements, hemineglect, dyspraxia of contralateral limbs, impaired muscle tone, mutism and contralateral weakness. As symptoms are sometimes ambivalent, patients may be misdiagnosed as functional disorder and lose the chance for immediate adequate treatments such as thrombolysis. We report a 59-year-old man with previous history for myocardial infarction, referred to emergency room with an acute dense right-side hemiplegia, positive Hoover sign, asymmetrical Babinski responses and intermittent ability to move his arm in some specific reflex actions despite plegia. Since brain computed tomography scan was unremarkable we could not be sure whether his symptoms were organic or functional until a diffusion weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging elucidated the situation.

21855865,Posterior fossa syndrome in adults: a new case and comprehensive survey of the literature.,"Mariën, Peter; De Smet, Hyo Jung; Wijgerde, Ellen; Verhoeven, Jo; Crols, Roel; De Deyn, Peter P",Mariën,"Although the posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) can be considered as an aetiologically heterogeneous condition affecting children and adults, it most often occurs in paediatric patients after cerebellar tumour surgery. In patients with a tumoural aetiology, the syndrome is typically characterised by a short symptom-free postoperative period followed by mutism of variable duration and behavioural and affective changes. More than 200 paediatric cases have been described but reports of adult patients are extremely rare. This paper discusses PFS in adults on the basis of a comprehensive literature survey and describes the pre- and postoperative findings in a new adult patient. In the preoperative phase, cognitive, behavioural and affective abnormalities were identified, matching a diagnosis of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998; Schmahmann, 2004). The immediate postoperative course was characterised by prefrontal-like behavioural and affective abnormalities, peduncular hallucinations and confusion evolving to psychosis. Akinetic mutism subsequently developed, lasted for 12 days and then alternated with episodes of diminished responsiveness in which pathological laughing and crying (PLC) occurred. Akinetic mutism resolved after treatment with a non-ergoline dopamine-agonist but CCAS persisted during longitudinal follow-up. From a semiological point of view ""relapsing-remitting akinetic mutism"" and PLC in our patient might add relevant information to current insights in the clinical expression of the PFS. As evidenced by a close parallelism between single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and clinical findings, CCAS as well as PFS seem to reflect functional disruption of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in cognitive, behavioural and affective functions. These findings may indicate that both syndromes share overt semiological resemblances and a common pathophysiological substrate. Consequently, CCAS and PFS may both be regarded as cerebellar-induced clinical conditions showing different aspects of a spectrum that range in degree of severity and symptom duration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2011.06.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Italy,eng

We here review the literature and summarize all anatomical structures related to the pathogenesis of this rare syndrome. We also report two illustrative cases of CM following surgical treatment of Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD; dysplastic gangliocytoma) in two adult patients. LDD is a rare benign cerebellar tumor. Surgical excision appears to be the only effective treatment. However, surgery is hampered by the difficulty to distinguish between tumor and healthy cerebellar tissue, which may result in extensive resection and cause neurological deficits such as CM. A review of the literature and our two cases suggest that lesions or functional impairment of paravermian structures including dentate nuclei, vermis, lateral hemispheres, and cerebellocortical pathways contribute to the development of CM. However, there is no single anatomical structure identified to be associated with CM. It is unknown whether some diseases such as LDD carry a higher risk of postoperative CM than others. As illustrated by our two cases, although there are no special means, optimal preoperative diagnosis might contribute to the prevention of this syndrome. Despite the severity, CM carries a favorable prognosis and generally resolves within a few months.To conclude, we review the clinical signs and particularly the pathophysiological observations and anatomical structures affected in the development of postoperative CM and contribute two cases illustrating the pathogenesis, prognosis, and possible prevention of this syndrome, to focus that CM might also occur in adults even in association with rare tumors.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-010-0278-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

Although rare, frank addiction to PDB has been reported, and, in such cases, has been associated with gait ataxia, tremor, dysarthria, limb weakness, and bradyphrenia, in various combinations. In such cases, the adverse neurologic consequences have been presumed to result from a direct toxic effect of this small, organic molecule. We report a case of chronic mothball ingestion where profound encephalopathy with cognitive, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar features appears to have been largely the result of PDB withdrawal, rather than direct toxicity. This case raises important questions about the mechanism of PDB neurotoxicity and possible treatment options for PDB-addicted patients.

She exhibited impaired consciousness with a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score of 13 until 1 month after onset. Her impaired consciousness recovered slowly to a normal state according to the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (23 points: full score) at 7 weeks after onset. On the other hand, she exhibited the typical clinical features of akinetic mutism (no spontaneous movement [akinesia] or speech [mutism]). On the DTT performed at 1-month, the upper, and lower dorsal ascending reticular activating systems, which are related to a disorder of consciousness, showed an almost normal state. In contrast, the prefronto-caudate and prefronto-thalamic tracts, which are related to akinetic mutism, showed severe injuries. These DTT results suggested that the patient's main clinical features were not a disorder of consciousness but akinetic mutism.

To the best of our knowledge, PFS due to cerebellar stroke has only been reported in patients who also underwent surgical treatment of the underlying vascular cause. We report longitudinal clinical, neurocognitive and neuroradiological findings in a 71-year-old right-handed patient who developed PFS following a right cerebellar haemorrhage that was not surgically evacuated. During follow-up, functional neuroimaging was conducted by means of quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT studies. After a 10-day period of akinetic mutism, the clinical picture developed into cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) with reversion to a previously learnt accent, consistent with neurogenic foreign accent syndrome (FAS). No psychometric evidence for dementia was found. Quantified Tc-99m-ECD SPECT studies consistently disclosed perfusional deficits in the anatomoclinically suspected but structurally intact bilateral prefrontal brain regions. Since no surgical treatment of the cerebellar haematoma was performed, this case report is presumably the first description of pure, ""non-surgical vascular PFS"". In addition, reversion to a previously learnt accent which represents a subtype of FAS has never been reported after cerebellar damage. The combination of this unique constellation of poststroke neurobehavioural changes reflected on SPECT shows that the cerebellum is crucially implicated in the modulation of neurocognitive and affective processes. A decrease of excitatory impulses from the lesioned cerebellum to the structurally intact supratentorial network subserving cognitive, behavioural and affective processes constitutes the likely pathophysiological mechanism underlying PFS and CCAS in this patient.",{},,"Cerebellum (London, England)",10.1007/s12311-013-0478-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31672142,Probable progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with immunosuppressant dose reduction following lung transplantation: a case report and literature review.,"Ishii, Kazuhiro; Yamamoto, Fumiko; Homma, Shinsuke; Okada, Yoshinori; Nakamichi, Kazuo; Saijo, Masayuki; Tamaoka, Akira",Ishii,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rapidly developing demyelinating disease in the cerebral white matter and is often caused by JC polyomavirus (JCV). PML after lung transplantation is rare and has a poor prognosis, with no established therapies. Reducing the patient's immunosuppressant doses, thereby restoring immunity, could be used to treat PML. However, some patients develop immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with this treatment, an immune-induced inflammatory response to JCV that results in serious neuronal damage. We herein report a case of a 60-year-old female who suffered from PML 5 years after lung transplantation, had worsened brain lesions thought to be related to PML-IRIS at the time of immunosuppressant reduction, and missed treatment opportunities. A 60-year-old female developed PML 5 years after lung transplantation. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple high-signal lesions, mainly in the cerebral white matter. Polymerase chain reaction found 0.32 million copies/mL of JCV in the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, she was given a diagnosis of PML. Mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus dosages were reduced, and CD4-positive cell counts and the blood concentration of each immunosuppressant were monitored. Mefloquine was also orally administered at a daily dose of 275 mg for 3 days and was then administered at a dose of 275 mg per week. Although the patient's CD4-positive cell counts increased and her immune system recovered, her symptoms and brain MRI findings worsened. We suspected PML progression or a transition to PML-IRIS. Steroid pulse therapy to suppress the inflammatory lesions was not possible but was retrospectively indicated. The patient rapidly began to exhibit akinetic mutism and died 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms. When neurologic symptoms and abnormal brain MRI findings are noted during immune recovery, it is often difficult to distinguish between progressed PML and PML-IRIS. However, the pathogenesis of brain lesions usually involves inflammation and immune-reactive mechanisms for JCV. Steroid pulse therapy, which can reduce inflammation, should thus be administered in organ transplantation cases with differential diagnoses including PML-IRIS.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-019-1493-1,PMC6822459,CD4 positive cell; Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; JC polyomavirus; Lung transplantation; Mefloquine; Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) presents with chaotic ocular saccades (opsoclonus), spontaneous muscular jerking (myoclonus) that may be accompanied by ataxia, strabismus, aphasia, or mutism. Its paraneoplastic variant in the adult is most commonly associated with small-cell lung cancer, followed by breast cancer. Importantly, neurological symptoms usually precede the diagnosis of breast cancer and tend to recure after its treatment. A 43-year-old premenopausal Caucasian woman with a medical history of hypertension was admitted following an episode of focal seizure. This progressed to generalised tonic-clonic seizures and she was subsequently loaded with phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam. Initial workup included whole body CT scan, viral and autoimmune serology. The CT scan revealed an enhancing right axillary lymph node, which in combination with Anti-Ri antibody positivity raised the spectre of paraneoplastic OMS. MRI of the head revealed subtle nonspecific white matter signal change within the centrum semiovale without any mass lesions, while MRI of the spine was unremarkable. An uncomplicated right mastectomy and axillary lymph node clearance was performed: histopathology revealed a 9-mm, grade 2, oestrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-negative (ER8, PR0), Her2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma, and 4/6 positive lymph nodes (T1b N2 M0). Two months later, she was readmitted with vertigo, diplopia, facial weakness, and ataxia, setting the diagnosis anti-Ri syndrome recurrence. MDT recommended mammogram and ultrasound of the left breast, which were normal. Subsequently, four months after initial discharge, she suffered another neurological recurrence; due to concomitant abdominal pain, PET-CT was performed demonstrating a hypermetabolic right ovarian focus. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed as per gynaecology MDT and final histology showed normal tubes and ovaries. She has remained on remission since then, with a negative annual mammogram follow-up. In conclusion, we report a case of OMS associated with breast cancer anti-Ri onconeural antibody. Its manifestations preceded the diagnosis of malignancy and it persisted after cancer treatment, underlining the importance for high clinical suspicion in cases of classical paraneoplastic neurological syndromes as well as the need for long-term clinical follow-up.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,World journal of surgical oncology,10.1186/s12957-021-02436-7,PMC8594106,Anti-Ri; Breast cancer; Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome; Paraneoplastic syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 61-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with speaking difficulties including repeated usage of the same words. He was hospitalized on the seventh day after symptom onset, and diffusion-weighted images on magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense regions in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus. On the 11th day after symptom onset, head computed tomography revealed ICH in the right occipital and parietal lobes. Routine laboratory evaluations and angiography revealed no cause of ICH. Myoclonus of the extremities and drowsiness were observed on the 15th day after symptom onset. He reached the state of akinetic mutism approximately two months after symptom onset. The cerebrospinal fluid test revealed positive real-time quaking-induced conversion and 14-3-3 protein. Electroencephalography revealed periodic sharp wave complexes. A clinical diagnosis of probable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was made according to the diagnostic criteria. After a relapse of pneumonia, he passed away on the 103rd day after symptom onset. Postmortem examination revealed ICH in the right posterior cingulate gyrus. No pathological change that might have caused ICH was obtained. Although the effect of sCJD on the onset of ICH is undeniable, the cause of ICH was unknown. Prion protein immunohistochemistry revealed the following results: (1) weak synaptic-type deposits in the tissue rarefacted by ICH; (2) synaptic-type deposits in the cerebral cortex, which showed fine vacuoles; and (3) perivacuolar-type deposits in the inferior temporal gyrus and lingual gyrus, which showed frequent large confluent vacuoles. Although it could be considered MM1-type sCJD clinically, this case was neuropathologically diagnosed as having MM1 + 2C-type sCJD. It was shown that ICH may occur in early-phase sCJD. To improve sCJD prognosis, treatment of complications and careful follow up are important. Furthermore, pathological diagnosis is indispensable for sCJD type diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12658,,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; fine vacuole; intracerebral hemorrhage; large confluent vacuole; synaptic type,Case Reports,Australia,eng

She was diagnosed with the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Grade II SAH due to the rupture of an aneurysm at the A2-3 junction in the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Endovascular coil embolization was successfully performed; however, postoperative computed tomography (CT) confirmed a massive hematoma in the corpus callosum and expansion into the cingulate gyrus, which was suspected to be due to preoperative or intraoperative rebleeding. The patient remained completely mum, which was considered as mutism due to a hematoma in the ACA territory. The postoperative clinical course was favorable, and the patient had fully recovered speech fluency with the disappearance of hematoma on CT scan at 44 days after the occurrence of SAH. This is a rare case of mutism caused by an interhemispheric hematoma due to rebleeding after SAH. No radical evacuation of the hematoma may be desirable for the improvement of mutism because additional structural damage to the ACA territory by surgical stress should be avoided.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_121_2022,PMC8986711,Distal anterior cerebral artery; Hematoma; Mutism; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports,United States,eng

Here, we report four cases of CJD with different clinical presentations diagnosed at our institution over a 2-year period. The first patient is an 82-year-old woman who presented with depression, cognitive decline, and word-finding difficulty over 4 weeks. The patient deteriorated neurologically to akinetic mutism and death within 6 weeks of presentation. The second patient is a 54-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis who presented with confusion, ataxia, and multiple falls over 4 weeks. She was treated initially for hepatic encephalopathy but continued to progress to mutism, startle myoclonus, and obtundation. Death occurred within 4 weeks of presentation. The third patient is a 58-year-old woman who presented with an 8-week history of confusion, urinary incontinence, Parkinsonism, ataxia, and myoclonus. Death occurred within 2 months from presentation. The fourth patient is a 67-year-old man who presented with a 6-week history of headache, blurred vision, ataxia, and personality change and progressed to confusion, myoclonus, akinetic mutism, and obtundation. Death occurred within 3 weeks from presentation. These four cases highlight the varied possible clinical presentations of CJD and demonstrate the importance of considering CJD in patients with atypical presentations of rapidly progressive cognitive decline. To diagnose CJD, brain biopsy remains the gold standard. However, the presence of CSF protein 14-3-3, typical MRI findings and suggestive EEG abnormalities, all support the diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2016.00138,PMC5002415,Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease; dementia; neuropathology; prion protein; spongiform encephalopathy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Following the procedure, she was extubated and noted to have left hemiparesis, neglect, and mutism without a CT correlate. Cerebral infarction was suspected, but urgent repeat angiography demonstrated patent cerebral vasculature. On the following day, symptoms persisted, and non-contrast head CT now showed cerebral edema localized to the right middle cerebral artery territory mimicking subacute infarction. CT perfusion imaging and angiography showed a widely patent MCA circulation, and suggested a regional hyperperfusion syndrome.

When paired with bilateral basal ganglia lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, these support the diagnosis of basal ganglia encephalitis (BGE). BGE is a rare but distinct entity of putative autoimmune etiology, with specific basal ganglia inflammation and acute movement disorders. A previous study identified dopamine-2 receptors (D2R) antibody to be positive in most BGE children, indicating that the D2R antibody may trigger the downstream pathological process in BGE patients. The highest levels of D2R are found in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens, and the olfactory tubercle. D2R antibody-positive BGE is widely reported in children.

We report on a patient with AM associated with injury of the prefronto-caudate tract and prefronto-thalamic tract following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). A 20-year-old man suffered from TBI resulting from a pedestrian car accident. Following the TBI, he developed abulia (decreased activity and speech) that worsened over approximately a year. His typical features of AM that remained stable from one year until two years after the TBI are: he showed no spontaneous movement or speech and remained recumbent with no spontaneous activity. On one-month DTT, the neural connectivity of the caudate nucleus to the medial prefrontal cortex was low in both hemispheres, and this neural connectivity was lower on two-year DTT. The orbitofrontal-thalamic tract was thin in the left hemisphere on one-month DTT, whereas this tract became thinner in both hemispheres on two-year DTT. Using serial DTTs, injuries of the prefronto-caudate tract and orbitofrontal-thalamic tract and degeneration of these injured neural tracts concurrent with aggravation of abulia to AM were demonstrated in a patient with mild TBI.

It has been only occasionally reported in adults and its features have not been fully characterized. In children and in young adults, medulloblastoma is the main reason for neurosurgery. A single case of postsurgical CMS is presented in an adult patient with a cerebellar hemorrhage and a systematic review of the published individual cases of CMS in adults was done. Literature review of individual cases found 30 patients, 18/30 (60%) males, from 20 to 71 years at diagnosis. All but one case was post-surgical, but in one of the post-surgical cases iatrogenic basilar artery occlusion was proposed as cause for CMS. The causes were: primary tumors of the posterior fossa in 16/22 (72.7%) metastasis in 3/30 (10%), ischemia in 3/30 (10%) cerebellar hemorrhage in 3/30 (10%), and benign lesions in 2/30 (6.7%) patients. 8/30 patients (26.7%) were reported as having persistent or incomplete resolution of CMS within 12 months. CMS is a rare occurrence in adults and spontaneous cerebellar hemorrhage has been reported in 3/30 (10%) adult patients. The generally accepted hypothesis is that CMS results from bilateral damage to the dentate nucleus or the dentate-rubro-thalamic tract, leading to cerebro-cerebellar diaschisis. Several causes might contribute in adults.

A case series and brief literature review.,"Anand, Sucharita; Kumar Paliwal, Vimal; Singh, Laxmi S; Uniyal, Ravi",Anand,"Catatonia is a well-described clinical syndrome characterized by features that range from mutism, negativism and stupor to agitation, mannerisms and stereotype. Causes of catatonia may range from organic brain disorders to psychiatric conditions. Despite a characteristic syndrome, catatonia is grossly under diagnosed. The reason for missed diagnosis of catatonia in neurology setting is not clear. Poor awareness is an unlikely cause because catatonia is taught among conditions with deregulated consciousness like vegetative state, locked-in state and akinetic mutism. We determined the proportion of catatonia patients correctly identified by neurology residents in neurology emergency. We also looked at the alternate diagnosis they received to identify catatonia mimics. Twelve patients (age 22-55 years, 7 females) of catatonia were discharged from a single unit of neurology department from 2007 to 2017. In the emergency department, neurology residents diagnosed none of the patients as catatonia. They offered diagnosis of extrapyramidal syndrome in 7, meningitis in 2, and conversion reaction, acute psychosis/encephalopathy and non-convulsive status epilepticus in one each. Their final diagnosis at discharge was catatonia due to general medical condition in 6 (progressive supranuclear palsy in 2, post-status epilepticus, uremic encephalopathy, glioblastoma multiforme and tuberculous meningitis in one each), catatonia due to major depression in 4, schizophrenia and idiopathic catatonia in one each. Extrapyramidal syndrome appeared as common mimic of catatonia. The literature reviewed also revealed the majority of organic catatonia secondary to causes that are usually associated with extrapyramidal features.

Typically, cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) has been seen in children and only rarely described in adults after surgery of the posterior fossa. This syndrome typically arises 48 hours after the initiating event and resolves approximately 7 to 8 weeks later. Characteristics of CMS include complete absence of speech without impaired consciousness, other cranial nerve deficits, or long tract signs. The authors report on 2 patients each of whom developed cerebellar mutism after tumor resection using a posterior fossa approach. The first patient underwent gross total resection of a pineal region tumor via a supracerebellar approach. The second patient underwent posterior fossa decompression for a left cerebellar hemispheric renal cell carcinoma metastasis with adjacent hemorrhage. One patient displayed a variant of cerebellar mutism with severe ataxic dysarthria without complete absence of speech, whereas the other demonstrated frank mutism. After neuroimaging studies confirmed the absence of a surgically treatable postoperative cause for the patients' symptoms, they were managed in a supportive fashion (eg, speech therapy) and improved within 3.5 months and 1 year, respectively.

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium.

21152213,Hyperacute therapies for childhood stroke: a case report and review of the literature.,"Irazuzta, Jose; Sullivan, Kevin J",Irazuzta,"Objective. The optimal management of pediatric patients with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is not known. Despite this, goal-oriented, time-sensitive therapies geared to rapid reestablishment of arterial blood flow are occasionally applied with beneficial effects. The inconsistent approach to AIS is in part due to a lack of knowledge and preparedness. Methods. Case report of a 12-year-old male with right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion resulting in dense left hemiplegia and mutism and review of the literature. Intervention(s). Mechanical thrombectomy, intra-arterial administration of rt-PA, vasodilators, and platelet inhibitors, and systemic anticoagulation and subsequent critical care support. Results. Restoration of right MCA blood flow and complete resolution of neurologic deficits. Conclusion. We report the gratifying outcome of treatment of a case of AIS in a pediatric patient treated with hyperacute therapies geared to arterial recanalization and subsequent neurologic critical care and review the pertinent literature. Guidelines for the emergency room management of pediatric AIS from prospective, randomized trials are needed.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neurology research international,10.1155/2010/497326,PMC2989694,,Case Reports,United States,eng
2291035,[Hematoma of the head of the caudate nucleus].,"Pedrazzi, P; Bogousslavsky, J; Regli, F",Pedrazzi,"We studied five patients with cerebral hemorrhage limited to the head of the caudate nucleus. This rare localization represents 11% of central nuclei hemorrhages. This entity has various clinical expressions; some are similar to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, others show the same manifestations associated with hemiparesis and neuropsychological findings, while still in others, the neuropsychological syndrome with speech, behaviour or memory disturbances predominates. Recovery depends on the patient's previous clinical status and on the presence of associated lesions at the time of hemorrhage. Typical warning signs, like headache, are often absent in the elderly and debilitated. Meningismus is explained by the intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage. Motor deficit, usually moderate, is probably due to impairment of the anterior portion of the posterior arm of the internal capsule. Destruction of the head of the left caudate nucleus, which is part of the circuit causing ""subcortical aphasias"", is responsible for non specific speech disturbances, that are however remarkably rich in semantic paraphasias. These dysfunctions could be caused by a ""cortical diaschisis"" as suggested by SPECT analysis. Memory dysfunction as a result of caudate lesion is questioned. However confusion and behavioural disturbances, like preservations, transitory mutism and self neglect, seem characteristic. As shown by cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies, these disturbances might represent a frontal dysfunction caused by the interruption of the dorso-latero-prefrontal and orbito-frontal circuits. When the hemorrhage extends beyond the head of the caudate nucleus, behavioural changes occur due to the involvement of neighbouring structures such as the thalamus, internal capsule, temporal lobe and nucleus accumbens. Caudate hemorrhages occur mostly in the elderly, often with long-standing arterial hypertension causing lesions of the lenticulo-striate arteries. Severe stenosis or complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with a fragile anastomotic circuit or angiopathies in younger individuals (particularly Asiatics: moyamoya disease) are less frequent, but they should be considered and investigated by arteriography. Vascular malformations are a rare cause and a relationship with amyloid angiopathy can only be suspected.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

Still, its presentation due to the ruptured aneurysm is rare and its presentation with akinetic mutism has not been reported. The patient in the present study is 21-year-old female who presented in our emergency department in an altered sensorium with Glasgow comma score (GCS) E2V1M1. She was intubated and resuscitated. Routine blood investigations, lipid profile, and hormonal studies were normal. Initial noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the interhemispheric fissure and evidence of bleeding in the pituitary gland. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was soon done, which showed an infarct and hemorrhage in the pituitary gland; there was an evidence of an infarct in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, and supplementary motor area. MR arteriography revealed an aneurysm at the left A1-anterior communicating artery (Acom) junction directed superomedially with diffuse spasm in a bilateral anterior cerebral artery. Pterional craniotomy was done with clipping of the aneurysm and evacuation of blood clots from the interhemispheric fissure and pituitary gland. Histopathology features suggestive of the non-functioning pituitary tumor with interspersed hemorrhagic necrosis. Intraarterial vasodilation with microcatheter injection was given, but vasospasm did not improve. Postoperatively, Levodopa was started. She used to track objects in front of her eye and started nodding her head in ""yes and no fashion,"" with power in limbs improved to 3/5 at 6 months of follow-up. Pituitary apoplexy with ruptured A1-Acom junction aneurysm with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma is rare, and its presentation with akinetic mutism has not been reported. As there is scarce literature suggesting an association between pituitary apoplexy and ruptured aneurysm, it is challenging to comment regarding its pathogenesis. Although akinetic mutism generally has a poor prognosis, it may respond to Levodopa with a better outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_942_2022,PMC9899474,Akinetic mutism; Pituitary apoplexy; Ruptured brain aneurysm; Ruptured intracranial Aneurysm,Case Reports,United States,eng

We present a unique such case where a bullet entered the petrous bone, traversed the cerebellar hemisphere and overlying tentorial leaflet, and reached the dorsal aspect of the midbrain, resulting in transient cerebellar mutism with an unexpectedly favorable functional recovery. A 17-year-old boy sustained a GSW to the left mastoid region with no exit wound and presented with agitation and confusion, ultimately leading to a coma. Head CT revealed a bullet trajectory through the left petrous bone, left cerebellar hemisphere, and left tentorial leaflet, with a retained bullet fragment in the quadrigeminal cistern, overlying the dorsal aspect of the midbrain. Computed tomography venography (CTV) demonstrated thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses and the internal jugular vein. The patient's hospital course was marked by the development of obstructive hydrocephalus, secondary to delayed cerebellar edema with fourth ventricular effacement and aqueductal compression, possibly worsened by concomitant left sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Following the emergency placement of an external ventricular drain and two weeks of mechanical ventilation, the patient's level of consciousness improved significantly, with excellent brainstem and cranial nerve function, ultimately leading to successful extubation. Although the patient exhibited cerebellar mutism secondary to his injury, his cognitive abilities and speech improved significantly during rehabilitation. At his three-month outpatient follow-up, he was ambulatory, independent in his daily living activities, and able to verbally communicate using full sentences. Though exceptional, survival and functional recovery may occur after a GSW to the posterior fossa. A basic understanding of ballistics and the importance of biomechanically resilient anatomic barriers, such as the petrous bone and tentorial leaflet, can help predict a good outcome.

Moreover, it is often underrecognized due to its resemblance to disorders of consciousness. However, when diagnosing catatonia, an antipsychotic medication may exacerbate the condition. The first-line treatment typically includes benzodiazepines and/or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). A 60-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and epilepsy presented with catatonic stupor. Despite stable treatment, she experienced an acute deterioration in consciousness, requiring hospitalization. Her condition improved markedly following a benzodiazepine challenge, as documented on EEG. This improvement was short-lived, but a second benzodiazepine challenge restored her from E1V1M1 (stupor) to E4V5M6 within minutes, as documented by a video recording. The patient was treated with lorazepam 1.5 mg/day orally and did not experience further relapses. The diagnosis of catatonia had been based on her scores on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS; Screening, 6/14; Severity, 19), despite meeting only two DSM-5 criteria for catatonia (stupor and mutism). The diagnosis was supported by EEG and video documentation, excluding other potential differential diagnoses such as nonconvulsive status epilepticus and encephalopathy. Additional quantitative EEG analyses indicated that benzodiazepine administration increased brainwide alpha and beta band power significantly, suggesting that the benzodiazepine normalized attention, consciousness, and long-range synchronization. This report additionally emphasizes the significance of video recordings in managing catatonia, and it helps in accurately tracking symptoms, documenting comprehensively, and improving patient understanding, which is crucial for treatment adherence.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neuropsychopharmacology reports,10.1002/npr2.12427,PMC11144595,DSM; EEG; benzodiazepine challenge; catatonia; video,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Moreover, dissociative symptoms may be modulated by right prefrontal activity. A single case, M.R., developed left hemiparesis, mutism and retrograde amnesia after a high-voltage electric shock without evidence of lasting brain lesions. M.R. suddenly recovered from his mutism following a mild brain trauma 2 years later. M.R.'s neuropsychological pattern and anatomoclinical correlations were studied through (i) language and memory assessment to characterize his deficits, (ii) functional neuroimaging during a standard language paradigm, and (iii) assessment of frontal and left insular connectivity through diffusion tractography imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation. A control evaluation was repeated after recovery. M.R. recovered from the left hemiparesis within 90 days of the accident, which indicated a transient right brain impairment. One year later, neurobehavioral, language and memory evaluations strongly suggested a dissociative component in the mutism and retrograde amnesia. Investigations (including MRI, fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, EEG and r-TMS) were normal. Twenty-seven months after the electrical injury, M.R. had a very mild head injury which was followed by a rapid recovery of speech. However, the retrograde amnesia persisted. This case indicates an interaction of both organic and dissociative mechanisms in order to explain the patient's symptoms. The study also illustrates dissociation in the time course of the two different dissociative symptoms in the same patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,European neurology,10.1159/000330953,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Four weeks later, we performed a technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-HMPAO SPECT) scan to study the patient's frontal lobe function. The SPECT scan revealed the causative bifrontal hypoperfusion, more prominent on the right, while the structurally evident cerebellar infarction was predictably masked by subacute hyperperfusion phenomenon. Contralateral frontal diaschisis is an established sequela of cerebellar infarction.

To study five patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with different behavioural features, we employed [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), MRI and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. Each patient's brain expressed a unique metabolic pattern. In three of the five patients, co-registered PET/MRI correlate islands of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behaviour. Two patients had suffered anoxic injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30-40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with relatively higher metabolic rates, that ranged up to 50-80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained <50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the cortical level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioural patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioural fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical- pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients do not appear to represent random survivals of a few neuronal islands; rather they reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awf131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

MRI findings are included in diagnostic criteria for probable CJD, giving a sensitivity and specificity more than 90%, but the atypical radiological presentations in the early stage of the disease could cause the diagnostic difficulties. CJD can be definitively diagnosed by histopathological confirmation, brain biopsy or at autopsy. We present a case of 53-year-old woman with a history of a rapidly progressive dementia with symptoms of visual impairment, increased extrapyramidal type muscle tonus, stereotypical movements and ataxic gait resulting in the patient's death after13 months. The clinical symptoms deteriorated progressively to myoclonus and akinetic mutism already on the 14th week. The series of diagnostic examinations were done to exclude the possible causes of dementia. Initial MRI evaluation as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) on the 9th week after the onset of symptoms created us a diagnostic conundrum. Subsequent MRI findings of symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia (nucleus caudatus, putamen) on the 13th week and EEG with periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) in frontal regions on the 18th week allowed us to diagnose the probable sCJD. The histopathological findings after brain biopsy on the 14th week demonstrated the presence of the abnormal prion protein deposits in the grey matter by immunohistochemistry with ICSM35, KG9 and 12 F10 antibodies and confirmed the diagnosis of sCJD. In this article we focus our attention on a rare association between radiological PRES syndrome and early clinical stage of sCJD. Although concurrent manifestation of these conditions can be accidental, but the immunogenic or neuropeptide mechanisms could explain such radiological MRI findings. A thorough knowledge of differential diagnostic of PRES may be especially useful in earlier diagnosis of sCJD.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-016-0751-8,PMC5120446,Biopsy; Case report; Magnetic resonance imaging; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and a CT scan of the cervical spine in the ED showed no acute findings. Due to hypoxia, the patient was eventually intubated. The patient also required a fasciotomy and eventually hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy due to the left lower extremity wound. He was transferred to our facility for further care. Due to incomplete cognitive recovery, as the patient was oriented to self only, further neurological workup, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, was obtained, which showed bilateral symmetric T2 FLAIR (Fluid attenuated inversion recovery) hyperintensity in the globus pallidus. The patient had slow and gradual deterioration with worsening encephalopathy, akinetic mutism, parkinsonian features, and seizures, which prompted further evaluation from neurology. The patient eventually underwent extensive workup, including a continuous video electroencephalogram (cvEEG), repeat MRI brain with and without contrast, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, MRI brain with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

Our aim is to compare the clinical manifestations, brain MRIs and prognoses of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy by different intake routes. We present two patients with toxic leukoencephalopathy caused by intravenous (IV) injection of heroin and 48 additional cases from systematic reviews of the literature published between 1994 and 2018. Among the 50 heroin abusers who developed leukoencephalopathy, inhalation was the most popular route (60%), followed by IV injection (30%) and snorting (10%). Mental changes, mutism and urine/fecal incontinence were the major symptoms in patients who IV injected heroin, while cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria were more common among those who inhaled heroin. Delayed-onset encephalopathy uniquely occurred in those who IV injected heroin, whereas progressive encephalopathy was more commonly observed in those who inhaled heroin. Clinical improvement was observed in 60% of patients, the overall mortality rate was 12%, and higher mortality was observed in patients who used the inhalation route (16.7%). The hallmarks on the MRIs of those who inhaled heroin were posterior to anterior involvement of the cerebral white matter and lesions in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, cerebellum and brainstem. In contrast, those who IV injected heroin had more frequent lesions in the subcortical U fibers and the genu of the internal capsules. These data could help physicians make an early diagnosis and predict prognosis and suggest that prompt antioxidative or symptomatic treatments might reduce the long-term consequences and mortality of heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-018-9131-1,,Heroin; Inhalation; Intravenous; Leukoencephalopathy; MRI; Snorting,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The lesions in 20 cases observed since 1972 were documented by autopsy, computerized tomography, or arteriogram; the autopsy records from the Massachusetts General hospital for the past 20 years and the published cases since 1820 were also reviewed. The findings suggest that infarction affecting the Broca area and its immediate environs, even deep into the brain, causes a mutism that is replaced by rapidly improving dyspraxic and effortful articulation, but that no significant distrubance in language function persists. The more complex syndrome traditionally referred to as Broca aphasia, including Broca's original case, is characterized by protracted mutism, verbal stereotypes, and agrammatism. It is associated with a considerably larger infarct which encompasses the operculum, including the Broca area, insula, and adjacent cerebrum, in the territory supplied by the upper division of the left middle cerebral artery.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.28.4.311,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Some postoperative consequences are difficult to predict due to their low incidence. However, it is essential to recognize reversible symptoms. Akinetic mutism is a devastating but reversible symptom that occurs after supplementary motor area (SMA) injury. This report aims to provide more information to support the clinical progression of this syndrome. A 47-year-old woman presented with psychomotor retardation and subtle weakness, particularly on the left side. A palpable mass was identified at the head vertex. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral parasagittal meningiomas with bone and sinus invasion of the SMA. A craniotomy was performed to remove the intracapsular tumor. Two days after the operation, the patient developed gradual deterioration in her motor function until it became a lock-in-like syndrome. Then, 1.5 months after treatment in the hospital and rehabilitation unit, she gradually improved her motor, cognitive, and psychomotor skills. Total recovery was achieved after 1 year. Surgery for lesions involving bilateral SMA can cause akinetic mutism. The typical manifestation of this syndrome may be devastating. However, it is reversible, and patients can regain full motor and cognitive functions over time without specific treatments. It is crucial to persevere and continue to provide the best care to the patient until recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_130_2024,PMC11090544,Akinetic mutism; Craniotomy; Magnetic resonance imaging; Parasagittal meningioma; Supplementary motor area,Case Reports,United States,eng

Etiology of locked-in syndrome can be vascular and nonvascular origin. Locked-in syndrome usually occurs as a consequence of thrombosis of intermedial segment of basilar artery that induces bilateral infarction of the ventrobasal part of the pons. Additionally, LIS can be caused by trauma which often leads to posttraumatic thrombosis of basilar artery. The incidence of locked-in syndrome is still unknown. The basic clinical features of locked-in syndrome are: quadriplegia (a consequence of disruption of corticospinal pathways located in ventral part of pons), different stages of paralysis of mimic musculature, paralysis of pharynx, tongue and palate with mutism and anarthria. The patient can not move, but is conscious and can communicate only by eye movements. Two patients with locked-in syndrome were present in this article. In the first case, the patient had classic locked-in syndrome that was first described by Plum and Posner. Other patient had incomplete form of locket-in syndrome which was first described by Bauer. In these two patients locked-in syndrome occurred as a consequence of trauma. In the first patient locked-in syndrome was caused by direct contusion of ventral part of pons while in other patient locked-in syndrome was a consequence of posttraumatic thrombosis of vertebrobasilar artery. The introduction of anticoagulant therapy, besides the other measures of intensive therapy, has shown complete justification in the second patient. The gradual partial recovery of neurologic deficit has developed in the second patient without any additional complications.",{},,Collegium antropologicum,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Croatia,eng

This type of aphemia has been reported to involve the right inferior precentral gyrus or right middle and inferior frontal gyri. Our patient had both lesions. The symptom and the lesion of this type of aphemia could differ from those of another type of aphemia corresponding to apraxia of speech, and the speech of Broca's aphasia could have multiple mechanisms. Our case shows Alexander's anomalous type with atypical lateralization and distribution of the lesion. Verbal intrahemispheric dissociation apraxia was suspected in our patient.

Numerous nonhepatic etiologies exist but they are infrequent and not well known, thus, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate care. Electroencephalography has a proven diagnostic and prognostic role in comatose patients. Burst suppression is a preterminal pattern found in deep coma states and is rarely associated with metabolic causes. We report the case of an 81-year-old Caucasian man presenting with rapidly progressive somnolence and mutism. Soon after his arrival in our hospital, he developed profound coma. A comprehensive diagnostic workup was unremarkable except for admission electroencephalography showing diffuse slowing of cerebral activity with an intermittent pattern of burst suppression. He was admitted to our intensive care unit for supportive care where malnutrition-related hyperammonemia was diagnosed. His clinical course was spontaneously favorable and follow-up electroencephalography demonstrated normal cerebral activity. Nonhepatic hyperammonemia is a rare and potentially reversible cause of encephalopathy. Ammonia level measurement should be part of the diagnostic workup in patients with unexplained coma, particularly in the setting of nutritional deficiencies or nutritional supply. Detection of diffuse and nonspecific mild to moderate slowing of cerebral activity (theta-delta ranges) on electroencephalography is common.

Upon admission, computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large cystic right frontal defect and a suggested small tumor recurrence. White matter of the frontal lobe appeared to be translucent and compatible with previous radiation. The severe mental changes were initially attributed to a delayed radiation encephalopathy. Neuropathologically, the white matter of the frontal lobe showed mild elevated cell density consistent with gliosis; however, a tumor recurrence invading the tip of the corpus callosum and invading the entire length both fornices appeared. From the neuropathological findings of massive local tumor recurrence in both fornices, together with the acute clinical onset, it seems unlikely that the sequel of radiotherapy caused akinetic mutism, but the symmetric and severe involvement of the limbic system. We conclude that the rapid progression from a state of alertness to a full clinical picture of akinetic mutism was because of infiltration of both fornices.",{},,European journal of neurology,10.1046/j.1468-1331.2002.00386.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

She was a carrier of HTLV-I virus, and developed subacute right hemiparesis and marked motor aphasia. She had a malignant lymphoma in the left neck and basal cell carcinoma in the right inguinal region. Three months after the onset, she became unable to walk because of the right leg weakness or to speak because of motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal T2-high lesions in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy revealed demyelinating pathology. A biopsy of the left parotid gland revealed a diffuse pleomorphic type large B cell lymphoma. Although anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were found in the blood or CSF. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Neurological examinations revealed severe motor aphasia, mild sensory aphasia/cognitive impairment, right hemiplegia, mild right hemihypesthesia, limb-kinetic apraxia in the left hand, idiomotor apraxia, agraphia, perseveration, marked spasticity and brisk tendon reflex in four extremities, and positive bilateral pathological reflexes. MRI showed multifocal T2-high lesions mainly in the cerebral white matter, predominantly in the left hemisphere, and partly in the cerebral cortex. No gadolinium enhancement was found. In addition, 99mTcECD-SPECT showed a broad decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortex. Anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive but anti-HIV antibody was negative in serum. ATL cells were found in 1-3% of the peripheral white blood cells after admission. CSF examination revealed that the cell count (1/microl), protein level (24 mg/dl), and IgG index (0.4) were all normal. However, the myelin basic protein level (321 pg/ml; normal < 102) was increased, JC virus DNA was detected by PCR, and anti-HTLV-I antibody (x 8) was detected in CSF. The regulatory region of the JC virus DNA in the CSF was partly deleted; immunostaining with anti-JC virus protein antibodies revealed the existence of JC virus in biopsied brain specimens, and these findings were consistent with PML. Her symptoms such as motor aphasia, cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis were subacutely progressive, and she developed akinetic mutism two weeks after admission. Since the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside for PML has been reported, she was administered 80 mg/day of the drug for five days. After treatment, her communication function was mildly improved but the efficacy was transient. Since it has been reported that HTLV-I, as well as HIV, activates the JC virus promoter and its proliferation, the latent infection of HTLV-I in the central nervous system (CNS) in this case might have stimulated the JC virus proliferation, promoting lesion extension over the cerebral cortex. There have been only a few reports of broad decreases in CBF by SPECT in PML patients. Further MRI and SPECT studies on PML patients are therefore necessary to evaluate the significance of HTLV-I in promoting the JC virus infiltration into the CNS.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Post-mortem examination of the brain showed cortical laminar necrosis with Alzheimer Type II gliosis but without demyelinisation of the corpus callosum. Cortical laminar necrosis with chronic ethylism is usually called Morel's laminar sclerosis. Nevertheless, histology is not typical of this diagnosis, because of necrosis especially of the second (and not the third) layer of the cortex, and because of the absence of lesion of the corpus callosum. MRI data are of interest here because they were rarely reported in cases of Morel's laminar sclerosis.",{},,Revue neurologique,10.1016/s0035-3787(07)90410-5,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

38356258,Anesthetic Considerations for Patients with Locked-In Syndrome Undergoing Endoscopic Procedures.,"Barakat, Monique T; Banerjee, Subhas; Angelotti, Timothy",Barakat,"BACKGROUND Delivering safe anesthetic care to a patient unable to communicate easily and effectively with the anesthesia team presents many unique challenges. Communication may be limited by language, which can be resolved with translation services, or neurological conditions, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury, which are not easily remedied. In such patients, the inability to communicate effectively can lead to anxiety and negatively impact the patient-anesthesiologist relationship, especially when higher cognitive functions are preserved. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient with locked-in syndrome (LIS), who presented to our endoscopy unit for a routine colonoscopy. The patient could only communicate with eye movements and blinking, thus limiting our ability to assess their pain or other needs in the perioperative period; however, she was otherwise cognitively intact. By utilizing the patient's home healthcare team and quickly adapting their unique communication methods during the perioperative period, we were able to provide an appropriate, safe anesthetic for this patient with LIS. CONCLUSIONS Many patients requiring an anesthetic are unable to effectively communicate due to language issues, hearing loss/mutism, neurological injury/stroke (aphasia), or developmental disabilities. The unique communication needs of this patient with LIS went beyond utilizing a translator and required the healthcare team to quickly learn a new communication method. We also discuss forms of intraoperative monitoring that can be used to differentiate consciousness from the anesthetized state in LIS patients, as well as making recommendations for future care of such patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942906,PMC10877638,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present a case of sCJD in a 64-year-old man that presented with corticobasal syndrome and survived for 3 years. He presented initially with dementia, hemiparkinsonism and alien limb phenomenon and was diagnosed with corticobasal degeneration, ultimately progressing to immobility and akinetic mutism. With a normal MRI 1 year before onset, his neuroimaging 1 year later revealed abnormal DaTscan, cortical and hippocampal atrophy with ventricular dilatation on MRI, and diffusion-weighted cortical ribboning and thalamic hyperintensity. Postmortem, the patient's brain was collected by the Parkinson's UK Tissue Bank. Prion protein immunohistochemistry revealed widespread diffuse microvacuolar staining without kuru-type plaques. Hyperphosphorylated tau was only found in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

Report of a case.,"Laplane, D; Degos, J D; Baulac, M; Gray, F",Laplane,"A 70-year-old woman had complex behavioural changes of sudden onset. The symptoms consisted of indifference, docility and inappropriate urination, but predominantly in a lack of attention. She was unable to maintain the attention necessary to perform a goal-directed activity and she was distracted by any stimulus, such as a sound, an object, or a word, which might induce behaviour irrelevant to the preconceived activity. She also exhibited confabulatory-amnestic syndrome. Neuropathological examination of the brain revealed infarcts in th territories of both anterior cerebral arteries. The rostral part of the anterior cingulate gyrus (Acg), small areas of the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex, and the underlying white matter were destroyed bilaterally. Infarction involved the deep territory of the left anterior cerebral artery, with a bilateral lesion of the fornices. This cingulate damage was more restricted than the Acg lesions reported in some cases of akinetic-mutism, which extended more caudally, but was presumably larger than the lesions created in psychosurgery. The impairment of attention was analyzed according to the possible roles of the cingulate and of the fornix lesions as causing a dysfunction between the frontal lobes and the hippocampal formations.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/0022-510x(81)90107-6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Up to 10% of cases of osmotic demyelination syndrome are associated with EPM, which mostly affects the thalamus and basal ganglia. It is commonly associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia. An elderly woman in her 60s presented with complaints of acute gastroenteritis and giddiness and visited the emergency ward. On examination, she was conscious and oriented to time but disoriented to place and person and had slurring of speech with signs of dehydration. Her serum sodium levels were 100 meq/L, and her brain MRI was normal. After shifting her to the intensive care unit, she was treated with 200 ml of 3% NaCl bolus to correct her hyponatremia. On day three, she began developing rigidity in both lower limbs, which progressed to the upper limbs with hyperreflexia and mutism. A brain MRI was done, which showed subtle hyperintensities in the caudate lobe with no other new findings. Her serum aldosterone and cortisol were on the lower side of the normal range.

The brain MRI showed no abnormality in the limbic system or temporal lobes. The cerebrospinal fluid showed slightly elevated protein with normal cells counts. This case was initially thought to be an encephalopathy of unknown etiology. On subsequent testings she was shown to have positive anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor (gAChR) antibodies. Although the initial steroid pulse and intravenous immunoglobulin therapies markedly improved both psychiatric and autonomic symptoms, they turned ineffective in subsequent recurrences. We were not able to treat her with plasmapheresis or with other immunisuppressive drugs because of her poor general status, thus their effectiveness could not be determined. Judging from her clinical course, in which immunotherapy was effective although somewhat limited, a possible involvement of an autoimmune mechanism was suspected; however, the exact pathogenesis remains undetermined.

Possible role of the medial thalamus and nucleus reticularis in behavior.,"Watson, R T; Valenstein, E; Heilman, K M",Watson,"A patient had an ischemic infarction of the right medial thalamus, with a resultant contralateral neglect syndrome. We propose that the medial thalamic nuclei, particularly centromedian and parafascicularis (CMPF), are normally involved in the arousal-activation process by which an organism can be aroused by and respond to novel or important stimuli. Specifically, we propose that (1) the mesencephalic reticular formation subserves tonic arousal to novel or painful stimuli by inhibiting the nucleus reticularis thalami (NR) and (2) that selective attention is mediated by cortical input to NR. The CMPF is closely associated with motor systems (basal ganglia, ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus [VL], and frontal lobes). A pathway involving CMPF, the frontal cortex, and the portion of NR associated with VL may be important in preparing the tonically aroused organism for action. Unilateral lesions of CMPF therefore induce an asymmetric hypokinesia, and bilateral lesions may induce akinetic mutism.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1981.00510080063009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

They had suffered from prolonged coma due to lesions in the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area. The authors believe that rotigotine effect in these cases could be due to restoration of dopaminergic transmission in medial frontal areas previously ""de-afferented"" from the lesions. Some comatous patients may experience a prolonged difficulty in recovering a normal state of consciousness. This phenomenon may be due to dysfunction of amynergic activating pathways connecting brainstem to the frontal cerebral cortex. In particular, dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways from the mesencephalon to the frontal cortical areas may be responsible for clinical pictures characterized by preserved alertness and total loss of interactions with the surrounding environment; the so called ""waking coma"" cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v91i1.7659,PMC7569577,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Several studies have reported that combined administration of various medications may induce SS. We report a case of SS in a patient who was being treated with dopaminergic and noradrenergic drugs. A 55-year-old man with a right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage extending to the left cerebral hemisphere presented with clinical features of akinetic mutism. Three months after onset, dopaminergic (methylphenidate, levodopa/benserazide) and noradrenergic (atomoxetine) drugs were administered to enhance his cognitive function. His cognitive function gradually improved during 8 weeks of dose escalation. One day after the dose of atomoxetine was increased from 40 mg/d to 60 mg/d, the patient developed inducible clonus, rigidity, diarrhea, tachycardia, and hyperthermia, in keeping with a diagnosis of SS. The symptoms and signs suggestive of SS resolved on the day following cessation of all dopaminergic and noradrenergic drugs. This case demonstrates that medications generally known as dopaminergic or noradrenergic agents could have serotonergic effects via a mechanism that is yet to be fully elucidated.

Tensile and compressive strains have direct effects on cell morphology and structure including changes in cytoskeletal structure and organization. Cytoskeletons are one of the structures which play a role as mechanoreceptors for the cells. The microstructure of the intermediate filaments and the expression of their proteins were investigated regarding the cells in the MFe of the human vocal fold unphonated over a decade.

We describe the clinicopathologic features of a very rare rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle and propose bromocriptine as a useful therapeutic agent for cerebellar mutism after posterior fossa surgery. A fourth ventricle tumor was incidentally discovered in an 18-year-old woman. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed ventriculomegaly and a solid tumor with low-intensity signals on T1-weighted images and high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images. There was slight gadolinium enhancement. The tumor was subtotally resected. Although its lower half was well circumscribed, its upper half manifested invasive growth. Histologically, 2 components were identified, synaptophysin-positive neurocytic cells forming perivascular pseudorosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytic cells with Rosenthal fibers. Overall, cellular atypia was minimal and the MIB-1 labeling index was low. On the basis of these histologic findings, the tumor bore striking similarity to the recently described rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors of the fourth ventricle. Postoperatively, the patient manifested cerebellar mutism. The administration of bromocriptine improved her neurological status dramatically. The natural history of rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors of the fourth ventricle is not yet fully understood. Therefore, careful and long-term follow-up monitoring of the tumor hosts is necessary. Bromocriptine therapy may promote recovery from mutism after posterior fossa surgery.",{},,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2004.05.039,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 73-year-old female was admitted to our hospital on October 20, 1986, with a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. Microsurgery was performed immediately on the day of admission because cerebral angiography revealed bilateral distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. Consciousness gradually deteriorated due to cerebral vasospasm from the 3rd day following surgery. To protect the brain, corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 1500 mg, dexamethasone 252 mg) was administered for 26 days after surgery. In spite of treatment, in March 1987 neurological examination revealed akinetic mutism, but CT scan did not reveal any evidence of tumor. CT scan performed on May 2, 1987, revealed a mass lesion in the left frontotemporal lobes and left basal ganglia. Histological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma (diffuse, large-cell type) was obtained by stereotactic biopsy. Radiotherapy (41 Gy of 60Co) was carried out. The CT scan performed on August 26, 1987 revealed that the abnormal enhanced lesion had disappeared. However, neurological findings had not remarkably improved. The patient died of renal failure in February 1988, but tumor recurrence had not been noted in CT scans. Autopsy could not be performed. Whole body CT scan and 67Gd scintigram did not reveal any other tumors except in the brain. Ruptured cerebral aneurysm followed by primary intracranial malignant lymphoma is very rarely reported. In such cases, which have unusual clinical courses and CT findings, we recommend stereotactic biopsy to treat this kind of radiosensitive tumor.

19935089,Electroconvulsive therapy-responsive catatonia in a medically complicated patient.,"Romanowicz, Magdalena; Sola, Christopher L",Romanowicz,"Profoundly depressed states of awareness classified as either catatonia or akinetic mutism have been reported in patients with various general medical conditions including encephalitis, frontal lobe tumors, or paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Catatonic features are often difficult to apprise in this context. This can result in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) discontinuation, although it remains the most effective treatment of catatonia. We describe the case of a patient with a history of unresectable right retroorbital squamous cell carcinoma, status poststereotactic radiation and cisplatin, and subsequent pneumococcal meningitis of the temporal lobe with abscess formation who became catatonic after receiving 3 bitemporal treatments with ECT for severe depression and whose catatonia improved with continued ECT. Furthermore, she demonstrated progressive improvement in mood, interactivity, and overall neurologic function after ECT treatment was completed. The search for an etiology of a profound catatonic state should include the probability of underlying medical disorder. Although lorazepam may be helpful in some cases, ECT deserves early consideration in catatonia, especially in cases where the underlying cause seems to be uncertain, even if the catatonia begins in the midst of treatment.",{},,The journal of ECT,10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181c18a8c,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

38514109,[Neuroleptic Intolerance and Residual Mutism in a Young Woman with Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) Encephalitis].,"Tajima, Kazue; Fukutake, Toshio",Tajima,"We report a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and residual mutism in a 23-year-old woman who presented with neuroleptic intolerance. Admission to our department for investigation of her abnormal behavior revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positivity for anti-NMDAR antibodies, and the patient underwent immunotherapy. However, generalized tonic seizures developed, requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Antipsychotic drugs were also administered for involuntary movements and insomnia. Thereafter, a malignant syndrome of severe hyperCKemia (Max: 191,120 IU/L) and shock developed, requiring resuscitation and three sessions of hemodialysis. Subsequent rituximab therapy led to improvement, except for mutism, which had newly developed during resuscitation. Seven months after initial admission, the patient was discharged with independent gait. However, her mutism still persists. Temporary mutism has been reported to occur in this type of encephalitis, albeit rarely. The fact that remission was not observed in this case may have been due to cerebellar infarction occurring during resuscitation, but the true cause remains unclear. Malignant syndrome or rhabdomyolysis, as seen in this patient, has also sometimes been reported in this form of encephalitis when antipsychotic agents, especially dopamine receptor blockers, have been administered. Therefore, such agents should be administered with caution in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

A 40-year-old-man had suffered from severe SAH 9 months before. An aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery was successfully clipped and the bone flap was removed for the purpose of the external decompression. Cranioplasty and V-P shunt were performed 1 month after SAH, but both were removed because of postoperative wound infection, viz. epidural and subdural abscess 4 months after SAH. Following this, L-P shunt was performed, and the patient was discharged with mild dementia. A concave deformity of the skin flap developed about 4 months after the L-P shunt. Neurological examination showed progressive left hemiparesis and akinetic mutism. A low CSF pressure was demonstrated, but RI cisternography revealed normal CSF circulation. Intrathecal infusion of the artificial CSF was carried out via lumbar puncture and concavity of the skin flap gradually improved. This procedure resulted in improvement of the neurological deficits. Cranioplasty with artificial bone was performed under continuous intrathecal infusion of the artificial CSF. Postoperative course was satisfactory and neurological examination revealed only mild dementia. The pathological mechanism in our case was probably due to the compression of the brain by the atmospheric pressure following the external decompression. Moreover, L-P shunt exaggerated this pathology by the overdrainage of CSF.",{},,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

22555127,Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy following a morphine overdose.,"Salazar, R; Dubow, J",Salazar,"We describe one patient and review the literature to define delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy, its etiology, pathophysiology and prognosis. We present a 54-year-old man with confusion and diffuse rigidity following a morphine overdose that had required intubation three weeks previously. A brain CT scan showed bilateral globi pallidi hypodensities and diffusion-weighted brain MRI (DWI) was consistent with acute cerebral anoxia. On day 20 after the initial presentation, the patient insidiously progressed to a state of ""akinetic mutism"". The brain MRI showed diffuse hyperintensity of the white matter on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. These areas were bright on DWI and were hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. An extensive autoimmune, metabolic, toxicological, and infectious work-up included arylsulfatase A enzyme levels, which were unremarkable. Therapy with levodopa was initiated with subsequent improvement of the diffuse rigidity. At discharge, the patient continued to be lethargic with moderate rigidity but began to display signs of recovery. He eventually fully recovered with residual mild confusion. Thus, delayed hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare complication of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, occurring in 2.75% of victims of carbon monoxide poisoning. It typically manifests two to 40 days after apparent recovery from an obtunded state. Prognosis is variable, but recovery can be complete. This report brings to light an important syndrome that can easily be misdiagnosed. Patients who present with these clinical and radiographic features should be treated fully and given time to recover without abrupt withdrawal of care.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2012.01.001,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng
