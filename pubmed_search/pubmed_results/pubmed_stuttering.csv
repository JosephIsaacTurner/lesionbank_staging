Case series with follow-up for 5 years, or until the stuttering resolved. University and community hospital neurology wards, and ambulatory neurology clinics. Four patients who developed stuttering speech in association with an acute ischemic stroke. A 68-year-old man acutely developed stuttering with a large left middle cerebral artery distribution stroke. A 59-year-old man who had stuttered as a child began to stutter 2 months after a left temporal lobe infarction, as nonfluent aphasia was improving. Another childhood stutterer, a 59-year-old originally left-handed man developed severe but transient stuttering with a right parietal infarction. A 55-year-old man with a left occipital infarction had a right hemianopia and an acquired stutter, for which he was anosognosic.

35342201,A Case Report of Stuttering Induced by Risperidone and Chlorpromazine.,"Sood, Shabnam",Sood,"Stuttering, a disturbance in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech is usually developmental. In some cases, it is acquired, and causes include stroke, brain tumor, and trauma. Implicated in the causation of stuttering are overactive presynaptic dopamine systems in the region of the brain that modulate verbalization. It is a rare side effect of antipsychotic medications and has been reported with phenothiazines, clozapine, and risperidone. This is a report of a patient who developed stuttering when treated first with chlorpromazine and later with risperidone. Patient had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and had been treated with antipsychotic medications including haloperidol, olanzapine, and paliperidone. He developed stuttering for the first time upon receiving intramuscular injections of chlorpromazine for treatment of agitation. The stutter improved and eventually resolved. He subsequently presented with a severe stutter when he was treated with risperidone. The stutter improved after risperidone was discontinued. It is speculated that drug-induced stuttering may be a manifestation of akathisia leading to noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms being implicated. It could be that either the cholinergic, dopaminergic or serotonergic systems are involved or that there is an imbalance of these systems that may be relevant.",{},,Psychopharmacology bulletin,,PMC8896748,antipsychotics; risperidone; stuttering,Case Reports,United States,eng

Fluency data were collected from the patient using observational and standardized assessment (Stuttering Severity Instrument-4). The patient underwent a course of treatment using fluency strategy education and practice to lead to generalization of skills across all communication environments. This service member responded favorably following a short course of fluency treatment because of the psychogenic nature of his stuttering, which was a symptom of his psychological health diagnoses.

One type, neurogenic stuttering, is usually attributable to strokes or other structural damages to the brain areas that are responsible for language fluency. Here, we present the first case of neurogenic stuttering caused by a brain abscess. The patient was a 60-year-old man admitted for a seizure and administered an anticonvulsant, after which he began stuttering. MRI revealed a brain abscess in the left frontal lobe that extended to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA (Brodmann's area) 9 and 46), frontal eye field (BA 8) and premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (BA 6). After neurosurgical drainage and antibiotic treatment, the symptoms had resolved.

31574328,Disruption of Frontal Aslant Tract Is Not Associated with Long-Term Postoperative Language Deficits.,"Young, Jacob S; Morshed, Ramin A; Mansoori, Ziba; Cha, Soonmee; Berger, Mitchel S",Young,"The frontal aslant tract (FAT) is a white matter fiber pathway connecting the superior frontal gyrus to the Broca area. This tract in the dominant hemisphere has been shown to play a role in speech initiation and production, and direct subcortical stimulation can induce stuttering and speech arrest in a patient. However, controversy remains as to whether disruption of this pathway will lead to a permanent language deficit and if it is even necessary to map this tract during tumor resections of the dominant frontal lobe. Here, we report a case of a patient with a lower-grade diffuse glioma invading the dominant FAT that was removed with an asleep craniotomy. In the immediate postoperative state, the patient had a transcortical motor dysphasia and was unable to initiate speech. These immediate language deficits quickly recovered, and the patient was neurologically intact at the time of discharge a few days after surgery. Given the high likelihood for a complete neurologic recovery including transient aphasia, we propose that awake mapping for the purpose of identifying the dominant FAT is unnecessary during tumor resection and that disruption of this tract is not associated with any long-term language deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.09.128,,Diffusion tensor imaging; Frontal aslant tract; Glioma; Language processing,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here we present a case of acquired stuttering as the consequence of immune-mediated encephalitis. The case of a 71-year old male who complained about the progressive onset of stuttering and disequilibrium as the consequence of immune-mediated encephalitis, is here reported. Administration of corticosteroid methylprednisolone was useful to recover from impairments. An in depth analysis of the electroencephalography (relative power of brain rhythms and source localization) during different phases of the disease/treatment was also realized. The patient showed a stuttering-like slowed speech with blocks and repetitions, especially at the beginning of words/sentences, with associated movements of the oro-facial muscles. Speech and general motor skills resulted slowed in their preparation/execution phases. Electroencephalography showed a ""slowed"" pattern, with delta/theta waves mainly in the prefrontal cortex and in sensorimotor networks. This case reports a probable immune-mediated encephalitis that resulted in acquired stuttering. The effect of ""slowed"" oscillatory brain activity on motor skills requesting sequencing and fine coordination (e.g. speech) could result in less ""synchronized"" systems, easily prone to disruptions.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of fluency disorders,10.1016/j.jfludis.2018.09.001,,Brain rhythms; Corticosteroids; EEG; Encephalitis; Stuttering,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
22178081,WEBINO and the return of the King's Speech.,"Beh, Shin C; Frohman, Elliot M",Beh,"We present a 69 year-old man with hypertension who developed the sudden onset of horizontal binocular diplopia and stuttering of speech. On examination, bilateral exotropia (i.e. 'wall-eyed') was observed in the primary position. Attempted horizontal saccades revealed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia; all consistent with the wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) syndrome. Convergence, vertical saccades and vestibular ocular reflexes were likewise impaired. Pupillary and levator palpebrae superioris functions were intact. Mild left-sided dysmetria, intention tremor and dysdiadochokinesia were elicited. Conspicuously, further characterization of the patient's history revealed that he had stuttered as a child, but it had resolved in adolescence. Brain MRI revealed an acute infarction of the mesencephalic and upper pontine tegmentum involving the periaqueductal gray region and the medial longitudinal fasciculus bilaterally with greater involvement of the left. Like the WEBINO syndrome, re-emergent developmental stuttering is a rare neurologic phenomenon. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a mesencephalic and upper pontine infarction causing both syndromes. We discuss the pathobiological underpinnings of the WEBINO syndrome and neurogenic stuttering and in relationship to this unusual case.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2011.11.035,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

(2) The stuttering occurrence rate at the second test was much higher than at the first test. (3) Almost all stuttering occurred on initial word sounds; stuttering on the medial and final word was less frequent. (4) Adaptation effect was absent. (5) Secondary behaviors such as closing of the eyes and grimacing were observed. The internal model related to cerebellar functions can be modified using feedback-error information.

Dysfluency was characterized by pronounced word and phrase reiterations, and sound and syllable reiterations to a lesser degree. Spontaneous speech was significantly more dysfluent than oral reading and repetition. Recitation and singing were minimally dysfluent. Reiterations were accompanied by reduced vocal loudness and increased rate of speech. Reiterations occurred in initial, medial, and final sentence position. Secondary symptoms such as facial grimacing were absent. In contrast to acquired cortical stuttering which is characterized by a preponderance of sound and syllable sentence initial repetitions, dysfluency was more closely characteristic of palilalia. The dysfluency occurred as a symptom of a diffuse nonspecific subcortical projection system defect related to massive infarction in the right middle cerebral artery distribution with associated atrophy.",{},,Brain and language,10.1016/0093-934x(83)90007-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The efficacy of toripalimab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody has been explored in the previous studies and it was established that immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with administration of this drug deserve proper attention and adequate management. A 43-year-old female patient with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was treated with toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (T-GA) as the first-line treatment. She developed immune-related encephalopathy with stuttering as the main clinical symptom and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple cerebral white matter demyelination changes, concomitant with asymptomatic cardiac enzyme elevation and hypothyroidism. The symptoms resolved after the discontinuation of toripalimab and corticosteroid treatment. Stuttering might be an early sign of neurotoxicity which can be easily neglected during the treatment. These findings provide guidance for the identification of these rare and occult neurological irAEs (n-irAEs) in the clinical practice.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-023-03140-7,PMC9985276,Encephalopathy; Immune checkpoint inhibitor; Immune-related adverse event; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; Toripalimab,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe the case of a 62-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with three episodes of new-onset brief isolated stuttering with no other speech impairment or associated focal neurologic deficits. His brain magnetic resonance imaging was notable for the presence of a small acute ischemic stroke involving the left precuneus cortex. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the association between stroke and acquired neurogenic stuttering. The evidence published to this date suggests that the underlying pathophysiology of acquired stutter does not localize to an isolated or focal region. The development of stuttering secondary to strokes may be the result of a disruption at any level in a cortico-striato-cortical integrative pathway mediating speech execution. Here we aimed to emphasize the importance of carefully evaluating new-onset recurrent episodic stuttering to rule out an underlying stroke or another neurogenic etiology.

Pontine infarcts often present with stuttering symptoms, referred to as pontine warning syndrome (PWS). Patients presenting with fluctuating symptoms can appear to have rapidly improving symptoms and thus often go untreated despite the risk of recurrent deficits. MRI carries a higher sensitivity in detecting posterior circulation strokes compared to computed topagraphy, but does not always indicate irreversible injury. Here we present the first description of a stuttering lacune, captured radiographically on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that was initially averted with the administration of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), only to return a month later and progress on imaging despite re-administration of tPA. During the first admission, our patient had spontaneous resolution of symptoms with complete reversal on restricted diffusion soon after IV tPA administration. On the second admission, the stuttering symptoms returned as did the same pontine lesion. Although his stuttering lesions lasted for several days, and the pontine lesion did ultimately progress to partial infarction on MRI, he was discharged home without neurologic deficits.

We describe a case and discuss the anatomical and physiological implications of this rare combination of symptoms. A 51-year-old woman presented with 3 days of ""feeling drunk"". She could further specify her symptoms as blurry vision, slurred speech, and gait instability. She had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her examination at presentation was remarkable only for marked somnolence. Over the next several hours she developed mild upgaze limitation and vertical nystagmus. Non-enhanced computed tomography of the brain was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5 mm acute infarct in the caudal midbrain. The first week the patient remained somnolent and manifested marked stuttering. The patient improved gradually with speech therapy. Strokes affecting the diencephalic-mesencephalic junction can manifest with stuttering. Defective projections of the reticular formation to the supplementary motor area, damaged extrapyramidal circuits, and/or aberrant propioceptive feedback due to involvement of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve are the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Somnolence can also be part of the presentation and is likely due to disruptions of sleep pathways subserved by the reticular activating system.

The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident with no resulting detectable trauma. However, shortly after the accident, R. L. developed a severe dysfluency that was later described as cortical stuttering. We reviewed the medical and rehabilitation work-up that attempted to determine whether the communication disorder was functional or organic in origin. Once the fluency disorder was determined to be caused by a suspected small, focal, hemispheric lesion, a five-month treatment program was undertaken that used a noval prosthetic approach to restore fluency.

It is classified based on clinical findings using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Mild TBI is defined as GCS 14-15; moderate, 9-13; and severe, 3-8. Patients with the same TBI classification may have very different underlying pathology. In moderate to severe TBI, the primary pathology may include contusions, hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, direct cellular damage, ""tearing and shearing of the tissues, loss of the blood-brain barrier, disruption of the neurochemical homeostasis and loss of the electrochemical function"". Although the primary pathology associated with mild TBI may be milder versions of the same pathology associated with moderate and severe TBI, it is generally a metabolic injury. However, it is reported that 15% of patients with mild TBI and a GCS score of 14 or 15 will have an intracranial lesion; less than 1% of these require neurosurgical intervention. Although patients with mild TBI may have intracranial lesions, it is rare that the presenting and only physical examination finding is an isolated neurologic finding.

This article proposes to examine the merit of the dichotomy between neurogenic and psychogenic bases of stuttering, including symptom exaggeration, for the evaluation and treatment of the disorder. Two case studies of adult onset stuttering in service members with mTBI from improvised explosive device blasts are presented in detail. Speech fluency was disrupted by abnormal pauses and speech hesitations, brief blocks, rapid repetitions, and occasional prolongations. There was also wide variability in the frequency of stuttering across topics and conversational situations. Treatment focused on reducing the frequency and severity of dysfluencies and included educational, psychological, environmental, and behavioral interventions. Stuttering characteristics as well as the absence of objective neurological findings ruled out neurogenic basis of stuttering in these two cases and pointed to psychogenic causes. However, the differential diagnosis had only limited value for developing the plan of care. The successful outcomes of the treatment serve to illustrate the complex interaction of neurological, psychological, emotional, and environmental factors of post-concussive symptoms and to underscore the notion that there are many facets to symptom presentation in post-combat health.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-151230,,Adult onset stuttering; mild traumatic brain injury; psychogenic disorder; rehabilitation,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

At the age of 54, he presented with resting tremor in the hand and foot on the left, and gradual slowness in voluntary movements. Two years later, resting tremor involved the right foot, and an expressionless face and frozen gait occurred. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was made and treatment with L-dopa and carbidopa resulted in conspicuous improvement. At the age of 57, he developed compulsive repetitions of syllables, words and phrases, and sentences infrequently when he spoke. They have been persisting for four years. Repetitions increased in spontaneous speech while they decreased in oral reading and repetition of sentences. These repetitions in speech were symptomatologically diagnosed as palilalia and acquired stuttering. Brain CT showed slight brain atrophy, and brain MRI disclosed a few lesions indicating lacunae in the left substantia nigra, left putamen, and right internal capsule. SPECT showed a slight decrease in blood flow in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia bilaterally. Full IQ on WAIS was 105, and neither agnosia nor apraxia was detected. Palilalia and acquired stuttering, though the pathomechanism has not been clarified, have been reported to occur usually secondary to cerebral vascucular lesions and very rarely in Parkinson's disease.

A current hypothesis on AOS-the dual route speech encoding (DRSE) hypothesis-and predictions based on DRSE were utilized to explore the nature of CAS in SE. One prediction based on the DRSE hypothesis is that there should be no difference in the frequency of occurrence of apraxic errors on words and non-words. This prediction was tested using a repetition task. The experimental stimuli included a list of minimal pairs that signaled voice-voiceless contrasts in words and non-words. Minimal-pair stimuli were presented orally, one at a time. SE's responses were recorded using audio and videotapes. Results indicate that SE's responses were characterized by numerous voicing errors. Most importantly, production of real word minimal pairs was superior to that of non-word minimal pairs.

One also suffered generalized seizures and the other had severe stuttering speech for seven days. The spectrum of toxic manifestations of metrizamide is reviewed with emphasis on the unusual lethargy and other depressive effects seen with this relatively safe agent. The hypothesis that metrizamide exerts a ouabain-like effect on the cortical surface was tested. Metrizamide in concentrations as high as 20 mM had no inhibitory effect on rat cerebral K+-para-nitrophenylphosphatase, a partial reaction of (Na+K+)-adenosine triphosphatase. Because metrizamide is a 2-deoxyglucose analogue, a competitive inhibition of hexokinase at the first step in glycolysis was also postulated. Metrizamide was found to competitively inhibit commercial (microbial) hexokinase. The Michaelis constant for glucose rises from 0.13 to 0.25 to 0.33 to 0.91 mM in the presence of 0, 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 mM metrizamide, respectively. Since the concentration of metrizamide over the cerebral cortex after routine myelography may be approximately 50 mM compared with a glucose concentration of only 3.6 mM (65 mg/dl), it is postulated that impaired brain glucose metabolism may be responsible for some of the toxic effects of metrizamide.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410090409,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical course, case selection, techniques and complications associated with acute to subacute surgical revascularization in atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar occlusion under appropriate patient selection based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) combined with careful evaluation of progressive neurological symptoms. We retrospectively reviewed nine consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo acute to subacute surgical revascularization for progressing stroke in atherosclerotic VBA occlusion consisting of a relatively small DWI lesion. Clinical characteristics, radiological findings, results of revascularization, and 3-month outcomes (mRS) were assessed. Seven patients underwent surgical revascularization (superficial temporal artery [STA]-superior cerebellar artery [SCA] bypass, n = 5; occipital artery [OA]-posterior inferior cerebellar artery [PICA] bypass, n = 1; vertebral endarterectomy, n = 1). Revascularization distal to the occlusion was successful in all seven patients. Two patients scheduled for STA-SCA bypass sustained irreversible confluent brainstem infarction before surgical intervention and died. The median time between admission and surgical treatment or irreversible coma was 20 h (range, 4-72 h). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months of seven patients who underwent surgical revascularization was good (mRS 0-2) in four patients, poor (mRS 3-6) in three patients.

Atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) occlusion presented with stuttering onset of symptoms and patients developed worsening symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency over hours to days. DWI was a useful modality to help guide the appropriate selection of patients for acute to subacute surgical revascularization for progressing stroke in atherosclerotic VBA occlusion.

We also review other cases of acquired stuttering and known anatomical correlates.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2013-009562,PMC3841416,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
2813606,[A case of delayed postanoxic encephalopathy with bilateral lesions of the corpus striatum].,"Yoshida, T",Yoshida,"Delayed neurological deterioration following anoxia is known to result from carbon monoxide exposure. However, it may also occur with anoxia of other types as well. The present report describes a case of delayed postanoxic encephalopathy with bilateral striatal lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. A 27-year-old man exhibited anoxic anoxia caused by upper airway obstruction following general anesthesia for shoulder fracture surgery. Initially he was delirious and markedly excited for one day and became apparently normal for the following three days. Then he relapsed into delayed neurological deterioration with speech and gait disturbance, clumsiness of hand, pyramidal signs and metamorphopsia. Thereafter, he became bed-ridden and fell into semicomatose state with marked motor restlessness, involuntary movement of the tongue and decorticate posture. Twenty-five days later he had a second recovery period after hyperbaric oxygenation that lead to the sequelae with speech and motor disturbances and mild mental changes. I examined the present case as an expert witness in a civil suit eleven years after initial anoxia. The patient showed slight intellectual impairment and personality change. Impairment in figure-ground differentiation and disorders of spatial thought were also observed. Neurological examination revealed anisocoria, dysarthria with acquired stuttering, disturbances of fractionated movement of fingers, writer's cramp and Babinski's sign bilaterally. Postural dystonia of both hands and fingers, rigidity and spasticity of all extremities were also present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral lesions of the corpus striatum, especially of the putamen. Some portion of the caudate nucleus was also involved. Cerebral cortices and white matter were slightly atrophic. From the above clinical course and neurological findings, we diagnosed the present case as delayed postanoxic encephalopathy. Ginsberg (1979) noted that in cases of anoxia not related to carbon monoxide, diffuse demyelinative changes of cerebral hemispheral white matter tended to be associated with relapsing clinical course, and gray matter injury was only seen in a few cases. MRI findings in the present case suggest that main site of the lesion to be in gray matter of the corpus striatum. In this respect, the present case is considered to be noteworthy.",{},,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

He demonstrated characteristic clinical features of MLC during childhood, such as slowly progressive megalencepaly, motor impairment with ataxia and spasticity, mild mental retardation, and well-controlled epilepsy. Thereafter, he showed specific neuropsychological symptoms, such as motor and vocal tics, compulsive behavior, perseveration, acquired stuttering, and dystonia since the age of 12. His performance abilities had been unchanged but his verbal abilities had degraded during the past 14 years. Higher cortical dysfunction tests revealed a frontal lobe dysfunction. On repeated brain MRI, a leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts remained stationary from infancy. On single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe was detected at the age of 3.5 and 17, but the severity of hypoperfusion was also unchanged, respectively. Our results indicate that the frontal lobe dysfunction may be relevant to the late-onset neuropsychological symptoms with MLC.",{},,Neuropediatrics,10.1055/s-2006-955930,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

1490309,[On stuttering-like hesitation resulting from infarct in the midbrain and the mesial thalami].,"Abe, K; Yokoyama, R; Yorifji, S",Abe,"We described a patient who developed stuttering after an infarct both in the midbrain and the medial part of bilateral thalami. Previously, speech disturbance resulting from these lesions has been named palilalia. However, we differentiated such a speech disturbance from both stuttering and palialia, because it had high frequency of repetition and monotonous rhythm, and because repetition was observed more frequently in the head of words than in the middle or the end of words. We proposed to call this speech abnormality stuttering-like hesitation in order to differentiate it from ordinary stuttering or palilalia. As the causative lesion for stuttering-like hesitation, we proposed the lesion in the neuronal circuit including the supplementary motor area and its afferent pathways, in addition to the lesion in the extrapyramidal system.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

He developed not only left hemiparesis but also speech dysfluency such as acquired stuttering and aphasia. MRI showed a brain tumor in the body of the corpus callosum. The main feature of his stuttering was repetition of syllables. His stuttering was associated without secondary phenomena such as tongue clicking. His stuttering demonstrated no adaptation benefit and no consistency effect. These results suggest that the stuttering in this patient might have characteristics of both developmental and acquired stuttering, which in turn may suggest that after brain tumor, acquired stuttering occurs in addition to a recurrence of developmental stuttering.",{},,No shinkei geka.

11086402,[A case of callosal apraxia without agraphia and acquired stuttering associated with callosal infarction].,"Hagiwara, H; Takeda, K; Saito, F; Shimizu, T; Bando, M",Hagiwara,"We report a 52-year-old right-handed man with cerebral infarction of the right anterior cerebral artery area. The MRI findings showed cerebral infarction in the trunk of the right corpus callosum, although some part of the posterior half of the trunk was spared. Some part of right precuneal gyrus, cingulate gyrus were also involved. The clinical feature of this case is characterized by following two points. First, although callosal apraxia is usually accompanied by agraphia, he showed apraxia with the left hand, but showed no agraphia. Secondary, he showed speech dysfluency mainly characterized by initial syllable repetitions. The nature of this speech dysfluency was determined as acquired stuttering. This case suggests that the pathway for praxis locates distinct portion from that for writing on corpus callosum. We analyzed callosal lesions of previous studies reporting callosal apraxia without agraphia, then compared to that of this case. And we also reviewed acquired stuttering report caused by callosal lesions. Consequently, we suggest that apraxia and stuttering were caused by damage of the trunk of the corpus callosum.

Detailed language, speech, and psychological evaluations support the contention that this neurologic syndrome is in fact a dementia. Stuttering and intermittent mutism characterize the disorder and may be valuable in the differentiation of dialysis dementia from other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Some of the speech and language defects are not explicable on the basis of intellectual deterioration and probably represent involvement of the cortical language centers.",{},,The Journal of speech and hearing disorders,10.1044/jshd.4202.238,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
