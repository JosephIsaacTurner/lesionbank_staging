3340293,Altitudinal neglect.,"Rapcsak, S Z; Cimino, C R; Heilman, K M",Rapcsak,"Previous clinical observations on patients with hemispatial neglect from unilateral hemispheric lesions suggest the brain's attentional mechanisms are organized along the horizontal dimensions of extrapersonal space. We now report a patient with Balint's syndrome caused by bilateral parieto-occipital infarctions, who demonstrated altitudinal neglect. On visual and tactile bisection of vertical rods, the patient consistently placed her mark well above the true midpoint, and this performance remained unchanged when the stimuli were simultaneously explored visually and tactually. She also showed altitudinal inattention in the visual modality by extinguishing the stimulus presented in the lower quadrants during double simultaneous stimulation across the horizontal meridian. These findings suggest that bilateral damage to the parietal lobes can lead to multimodal attentional and exploratory deficits along the vertical dimensions of extrapersonal space.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.38.2.277,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

They also had anosognosia, visuospatial disorders, and emotional flattening. In animals, neglect can be induced by lesions along a cortico-limbic-reticular loop including the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. We propose that an activation defect is responsible not only for the neglect and akinesia, but also for the visuospatial and emotional defects usually associated with right-hemisphere cortical dysfunction.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.29.5.690,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

This article offers an update of the intraoperative workflow and the general principles behind the 3D US acquisition of high-quality images.The authors also provide case examples illustrating the technique in two small mesial temporal lobe lesions and in one insular glioma. Due to the ease of acquiring new images for navigation, the operations can be guided by updated image volumes throughout the entire course of surgery. The high accuracy offered by 3D US systems, based on nearly real-time images, allows for precise and safe resections.

38288174,Bipolar Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury: A Case Report.,"Altuwairqi, Yasir",Altuwairqi,"I report an unusual case in Saudi Arabia of a 28-year-old man who had bipolar disorder due to a traumatic brain injury suffered 10 years previously. He had been evaluated and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as well as amphetamine and hash use disorder until recently, when the team noticed a poor response to treatment and the continuation of his cognitive features. After a reevaluation of the history and evidence of the brain lesions on the MRI, the diagnosis was changed to bipolar disorder due to a traumatic brain injury. The patient had shown a fair response to valproate and risperidone. This report emphasizes the significance of ruling out the medical factors contributing to the manifestation of any novel psychiatric symptom, necessitating greater attention to the account of cranial trauma and periods of unconsciousness. Psychiatrists should be aware of these overlooked cases and encourage colleagues in the field to maintain a high index of suspicion and to take a good relevant history of brain injury insults, especially when there are cognitive features and a poor response to medications. The patient exhibited symptoms of inattention, memory difficulties, reasoning deficits, and poor judgment, but he did not meet the criteria for a minor or major cognitive disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.51292,PMC10824366,bipolar disorder; frontal lobe; schizoaffective disorder; substance use disorder.; traumatic brain injury (tbi),Case Reports,United States,eng
2377286,Facial neglect.,"Young, A W; de Haan, E H; Newcombe, F; Hay, D C",Young,"Following a stroke, a retired industrial chemist, K.L., complained that faces looked ""different"" and had become difficult to recognize. Investigation of this problem revealed that it particularly affected the left half of a face as seen by K.L. Defective recognition of this (left) half was found for normal faces, chimaeric faces, and for half-faces presented in isolation, whether upright or inverted. The problem was apparent for both internal and external facial features. Further studies with chimaeric faces demonstrated inattention to left-side features in K.L.'s judgements of facial expression and of resemblance between faces. Moreover, the left-half of a chimaeric face was affected even when it was itself forming part of the face positioned on the right in a display of two horizontally aligned chimaerics. K.L.'s spatial contrast sensitivity function was within normal limits for his age. He did not experience differential difficulty in recognizing the left side of everyday objects or of car-fronts (another stimulus class demanding within-category discrimination between visually similar items that display approximate left-right symmetry). He was also able to sort left or right half-stimuli correctly into the categories ""human face"", ""dog face"", or ""tree"". Although K.L. had a left visual field defect, the problem with faces occurred within otherwise intact parts of his field of vision.

It has been shown that this phenomenon of letter-by-letter reading cannot be accounted for by visual or perceptual factors nor by impairment of visual span of apprehension. The exceptionally slow speed of reading was documented and a clear relationship between word length and reading speed established. Performance on tasks considered to maximize whole word reading which at the same time prevent the possibility of letter-by-letter reading, namely, reading script and reading with tachistoscopic presentation, was impaired. The satisfactory performance of these two patients on tasks of picture interpretation suggests that the two components of the syndrome simultanagnosia, letter-by-letter reading and piecemeal perception of complex scenes, are dissociable. Three alternative explanations of letter-by-letter reading are considered and we conclude that in this type of acquired dyslexia there is damage to the system through which a visual word-form is attained.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.1.99,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
10440071,Neglect without extinction.,"Cocchini, G; Cubelli, R; Della Sala, S; Beschin, N",Cocchini,"A patient, AB, is reported who showed clear signs of neglect but no extinction (N+ E-). Several hypotheses proposed to account for this dissociation were put to the test. The postulated association between motor neglect and extinction did not hold good, nor did the possibility that the N+ E- dissociation may be traced back to the difference in test requirements and therefore observed only in patients with object-centred neglect. Likewise, manipulating the physical features of the stimuli (relative size, exposure time, presentation synchrony) did not elicit extinction. However, when the task demands were modified by asking the patient to perform a further spatial analysis of the stimuli, rather than simply detect them, extinction emerged. Since AB performed well on several neglect tasks requiring parallel processing, while failing all tasks calling for serial processing, the hypothesis is put forward that AB's N+ E- dissociation could be interpreted within the parallel/serial distinction framework.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70802-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Italy,eng
36370508,Cerebral venous thrombosis following an immunoglobulin-E mediated anaphylactic reaction.,"Dias da Costa, Mariana; Nascimento Alves, Pedro; Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; Canhão, Patrícia",Dias da Costa,"Prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory states are known cerebral venous thrombosis risk factors. To date, two cases of venous thrombotic events after immunoglobulin-E mediated anaphylaxis have been reported. Herein, we describe the first case of cerebral venous thrombosis in close temporal relation with an immunoglobulin-E mediated anaphylactic event. A 51-year-old female presented with headache, language, and mental disturbance lasting for two days. Two days before the onset, she had undergone a provocative test with deflazacort to study an allergy history; after the test she developed a severe anaphylactic reaction. There were no other comorbidities, and in addition to contraceptive pill, she did not take other medications. On admission the patient was drowsy, with anomic aphasia, inattention and memory impairment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging depicted a left caudate and lenticulo-capsulo-thalamic venous infarct and thrombosis in the deep venous system. The patient was treated with anticoagulation and showed progressive improvement. Neoplastic and pro-thrombotic diseases were excluded. The close temporal association between the anaphylactic reaction and cerebral venous thrombosis suggests that anaphylactic reaction could have been a cerebral venous thrombosis precipitating factor. Immunoglobulin-E have been suggested to have prothrombotic activity by stimulating the release of platelet activation factor, thromboxane A2 and serotonin. This case adds on to the available information on possible cerebral venous thrombosis associated conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2022.106873,,Anaphylaxis; Cerebral venous thrombosis; Corticosteroids; Immunoglobulin-E,Case Reports,United States,eng

Stuck-in-set perseveration, the inappropriate maintenance of a current category or framework, involves an underlying process deficit in executive functioning and is related neuroanatomically to frontal lobe damage. Recurrent perseveration, the unintentional repetition of a previous response to a subsequent stimulus, involves an abnormal post-facilitation of memory traces and is related neuroanatomically to posterior left hemisphere damage. Continuous perseveration is the inappropriate prolongation or repetition of a behavior without interruption.

31125738,Regression of left hyperschematia after prism adaptation: A single case study.,"Di Marco, Julie; Lunven, Marine; Revol, Patrice; Christophe, Laure; Jacquin-Courtois, Sophie; Vallar, Giuseppe; Rode, Gilles",Di Marco,"Prism adaptation (PA) is a promising treatment in the rehabilitation of post-stroke cognitive disorders such as unilateral spatial neglect or constructional deficits. Right brain damage can bring about another representational spatial disorder, termed «hyperschematia», and defined by a left-sided disproportionate expansion of drawings by copy and from memory, and by an overestimation of left lateral extent when a leftward movement is required. This case study aimed at evaluating the effect of PA induced by prismatic lenses creating a shift to the left on hyperschematia signs. A 63-year-old woman with left hyperschematia, consecutive to a right fronto-temporo-parietal hematoma, was exposed to a leftward optical deviation produced by prismatic lenses. An anatomical MRI studied topography of the brain lesion; the patient's lesion was then mapped onto tractography reconstructions of white matter pathways. Results showed that PA significantly reduced the left-sided expansion of drawing by copy and from memory, and the overestimation of left lateral extent, immediately after prism removal and 4 days later, indicating a persistent long lasting cognitive effect. MRI showed a right hemisphere disconnection of the posterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, and of the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. Overall, these findings suggest that: i) PA is effective also in hyperschematia by re-orientating spatial attention towards the right side of space, with a relative rightward PA-induced unbalance, and re-setting the spatial representation to the left side of space, contralateral to the side of the lesion; ii) the left misrepresentation of lateral extent may be related to a disconnection between visual coordinates and attentional networks to the frontal lobe.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.04.002,,Bottom-up; Hyperschematia; Prism adaptation; Space representation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
30987454,Case of right hemispatial neglect and transcortical sensory aphasia following left occipitotemporoparietal glioblastoma resection.,"DeDios-Stern, Samantha; Durkin, Nicole M; Soble, Jason R",DeDios-Stern,"The neurobehavioral syndrome of hemispatial neglect, which can result from insults such as stroke, brain tumor, or head injury, has most frequently been described as occurring for the left-side of hemispace following lesions to the right hemisphere. While right hemispatial neglect/inattention may occur following left hemisphere lesions as well, it has received limited attention in the scientific literature. The present case describes an inpatient neuropsychological evaluation with a 67-year-old, African American man presenting with right hemispatial neglect following resection of a large glioblastoma in the left occipitotemporoparietal region. The evaluation included a clinical interview, neurobehavioral status examination, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results documented consistent evidence of right hemispatial neglect across the administered tests, which could not be attributed to an established right visual field cut. Neuropsychological testing also revealed nearly global deficits in complex visuoperception, posterior/receptive language, memory, and complex attention/executive functioning abilities, while basic attention remained intact. Further remarkable findings of this case included color anomia and transcortical sensory aphasia. Findings from the case are discussed in the context of the preexisting literature on hemispatial neglect and the theoretical specialization of the parietal lobe for spatial attention/awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Applied neuropsychology.

32132404,Upper Vertical Spatial Neglect With A Right Temporal Lobe Stroke.,"Morris, Michael; Mańkowska, Aleksandra; Heilman, Kenneth M",Morris,"Individuals with a hemispheric infarction often reveal inattention to, or neglect of, contralesional lateral space (ie, hemispatial neglect). Individuals with a bilateral ventral temporal-occipital lesion have been shown to demonstrate upper vertical neglect, and those with a bilateral parietal-occipital lesion have been shown to demonstrate lower vertical neglect. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of individuals with vertical neglect from a unilateral hemispheric lesion. We report on a 72-year-old, right-handed male who developed transient left hemiparesis. On examination, he had left facial weakness and he bisected horizontal lines to the left of the midline (ie, ipsilesional neglect). In addition, on a line bisection test involving nine vertical line bisections, he demonstrated downward deviation in the majority of the trials; healthy individuals deviate upward. On brain imaging, our patient revealed a cerebral infarction, primarily affecting the right temporal lobe; the temporal lobes contain the ventral attentional network that allocates attention upward. There is also some evidence that, whereas the right hemisphere mediates attention upward, the left mediates attention downward. Therefore, injury to the right temporal lobe may account for our patient's upward neglect with downward deviation. However, further studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of vertical neglect.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000221,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Classically considered an implicit process, one patient with isolated hippocampal damage is severely impaired at VSL tasks, suggesting involvement of explicit memory.

Although the extraction of such regularities, or statistical learning (SL), is typically viewed as a cortical process, recent studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus. These studies have employed fMRI, leaving open the possibility that the MTL is involved but not necessary for SL. Here, we examined this issue in a case study of LSJ, a patient with complete bilateral hippocampal loss and broader MTL damage. In Experiments 1 and 2, LSJ and matched control participants were passively exposed to a continuous sequence of shapes, syllables, scenes, or tones containing temporal regularities in the co-occurrence of items. In a subsequent test phase, the control groups exhibited reliable SL in all conditions, successfully discriminating regularities from recombinations of the same items into novel foil sequences. LSJ, however, exhibited no SL, failing to discriminate regularities from foils. Experiment 3 ruled out more general explanations for this failure, such as inattention during exposure or difficulty following test instructions, by showing that LSJ could discriminate which individual items had been exposed. These findings provide converging support for the importance of the MTL in extracting temporal regularities.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn_a_00578,PMC4264662,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

Schizophrenia is associated with early mortality, with 40% of this excess mortality due to suicide. This is a case of patient with schizophrenia who was treated with quetiapine after suffering a traumatic brain injury and recovered enough to be discharged to a rehabilitation unit. This case illustrates the neuroprotective effects of quetiapine in treating neurologic deficits in a patient who recently suffered a traumatic brain injury. This is a case report of a patient with schizophrenia treated in the hospital setting. He was placed on quetiapine after suffering a traumatic brain injury due to a suicide attempt in which he shot himself with a nail gun. The patient initially presented with neurologic deficits suggestive of traumatic brain injury (inattention, memory loss, muscle weakness) and psychosis from schizophrenia. He was treated with quetiapine and recovered enough to be discharged to a rehabilitation unit. Quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, has been shown to significantly decrease blood–brain barrier hyperpermeability by preserving tight junction integrity in small animal models. This anti-inflammatory effect may also help to preserve neurogenesis in patients with traumatic brain injury, as shown in this case. This case may help elucidate the nature of quetiapine’s neuroprotective effects in patients who have suffered traumatic brain injury and also highlights the need to further investigate other atypical antipsychotics and their potential neuroprotective role in treating traumatic brain injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,International journal of psychiatry in medicine,10.1177/0091217419838105,,TBI; neurogenesis; neuroprotective; quetiapine; schizophrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
25520275,Cognitive and affective disturbances following focal brainstem lesions: a review and report of three cases.,"D'aes, Tine; Mariën, Peter",D'aes,"Although insights in cerebellar neurocognition and affect are continuously growing, little is known about the role of the brainstem in cognitive and behavioural processing. In this paper, it is hypothesized that the brainstem is an inherent functional part of the cerebellocerebral network subserving cognition and affect, and that isolated brainstem damage may cause a constellation of symptoms closely resembling the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) following cerebellar pathology. In order to investigate these premises, the available literature on cognitive and affective disturbances following brainstem lesions was critically reviewed starting from the pioneer descriptions in the 1950s till June 2012. Three personal cases were added to a study group of 75 cases with isolated vascular brainstem damage. In a cohort of 30 patients that allowed construction of anatomoclinical correlations in a reliable way, a range of cognitive and behavioural symptoms, typically associated with impairment of cortical or limbic areas, were identified. Executive dysfunction, attentional deficits and a decline in general intellectual capacity represent the most common cognitive findings, but memory, visuospatial skills, language and praxis may be impaired as well. Almost half of the cases presented with behavioural or affective changes. Analysis of SPECT findings indicates that functional suppression of frontal, parietal and to a lesser extent also the temporal areas are common phenomena after isolated brainstem stroke. As reflected by diaschisis affecting the cerebellocerebral network, a loss of excitatory input from the brainstem to the cerebellum and cerebrum may induce disruption of several cortical regions as well as emotional control centres resulting in and a constellation of symptoms closely resembling the CCAS.

Case 1 is a 49-year-old male with a history of IV heroin abuse who presented after being found down for an unknown period of time. He awoke with no memory of events leading up to hospitalization and was unable to retain new information. Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine and opiates. Traditional vascular risk factors included obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His recovery was complicated by continued drug use and one episode of cardiac arrest. Despite cognitive rehabilitation, only minimal improvements in his anterograde memory were observed during his annual follow-up. Case 2 is a 23-year-old male with a history of attention deficit disorder treated with dexmethylphenidate and a history of consistent marijuana and cocaine abuse, who presented with nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute-onset short-term memory loss. Urine toxicology was negative for cocaine and opiates and positive for marijuana. He had no known vascular risk factors. With cognitive rehabilitation and discontinuation of illicit drug use, he demonstrated a significant improvement in his memory function over the course of six months. Brain MRI in both patients showed symmetric bilateral hippocampal diffusion restriction without post-contrast enhancement with corresponding hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. In both patients, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were unremarkable for inflammation or infection, and electroencephalograms were normal in awake and drowsy states. Bilateral hippocampal ischemia should be considered as a potential cause of acute onset anterograde amnesia in patients with a history of cocaine abuse. Other substances such as heroin and dexmethylphenidate may potentially increase susceptibility for hippocampal ischemia in patients using cocaine. Discontinuation of illicit drug abuse can influence the degree of recovery from acute bilateral hippocampal ischemia.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.26435,PMC9337781,acute ischemia; amnesia; case reports; cocaine; hippocampus; neurology; opiate,Case Reports,United States,eng

24227740,Role of somatosensory cortex in visuospatial attention.,"Balslev, Daniela; Odoj, Bartholomäus; Karnath, Hans-Otto",Balslev,"The human somatosensory cortex (S1) is not among the brain areas usually associated with visuospatial attention. However, such a function can be presumed, given the recently identified eye proprioceptive input to S1 and the established links between gaze and attention. Here we investigated a rare patient with a focal lesion of the right postcentral gyrus that interferes with the processing of eye proprioception without affecting the ability to locate visual objects relative to her body or to execute eye movements. As a behavioral measure of spatial attention, we recorded fixation time during visual search and reaction time for visual discrimination in lateral displays. In contrast to a group of age-matched controls, the patient showed a gradient in looking time and in visual sensitivity toward the midline. Because an attention bias in the opposite direction, toward the ipsilesional space, occurs in patients with spatial neglect, in a second study, we asked whether the incidental coinjury of S1 together with the neglect-typical perisylvian lesion leads to a milder neglect. A voxelwise lesion behavior mapping analysis of a group of right-hemisphere stroke patients supported this hypothesis. The effect of an isolated S1 lesion on visual exploration and visual sensitivity as well as the modulatory role of S1 in spatial neglect suggest a role of this area in visuospatial attention. We hypothesize that the proprioceptive gaze signal in S1, although playing only a minor role in locating visual objects relative to the body, affects the allocation of attention in the visual space.",{},,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1112-13.2013,PMC6619751,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

By contrast, similar changes in distractor load had little or no effect on the neglect of a patient with a fronto-parietal lesion.

Impairments in attention and memory have been well characterized in TBI, and are likely related to disruption of cholinergic functioning in the hippocampus. Additionally, disturbances in this neurotransmitter system may also account for disturbances in sensory gating and discriminative attention in this population. The electroencephalographic P50 waveform of the evoked response to paired auditory stimuli may provide a physiologic market of impaired sensory gating among TBI survivors. The first application of this recording assessment to the TBI population is reported. Preliminary findings in three cases are presented, and the interpretation of impaired sensory gating in this population is discussed.

29233717,The influence of visual and phonological features on the hemispheric processing of hierarchical Navon letters.,"Aiello, Marilena; Merola, Sheila; Lasaponara, Stefano; Pinto, Mario; Tomaiuolo, Francesco; Doricchi, Fabrizio",Aiello,"The possibility of allocating attentional resources to the ""global"" shape or to the ""local"" details of pictorial stimuli helps visual processing. Investigations with hierarchical Navon letters, that are large ""global"" letters made up of small ""local"" ones, consistently demonstrate a right hemisphere advantage for global processing and a left hemisphere advantage for local processing. Here we investigated how the visual and phonological features of the global and local components of Navon letters influence these hemispheric advantages. In a first study in healthy participants, we contrasted the hemispheric processing of hierarchical letters with global and local items competing for response selection, to the processing of hierarchical letters in which a letter, a false-letter conveying no phonological information or a geometrical shape presented at the unattended level did not compete for response selection. In a second study, we investigated the hemispheric processing of hierarchical stimuli in which global and local letters were both visually and phonologically congruent (e.g. large uppercase G made of smaller uppercase G), visually incongruent and phonologically congruent (e.g. large uppercase G made of small lowercase g) or visually incongruent and phonologically incongruent (e.g. large uppercase G made of small lowercase or uppercase M). In a third study, we administered the same tasks to a right brain damaged patient with a lesion involving pre-striate areas engaged by global processing. The results of the first two experiments showed that the global abilities of the left hemisphere are limited because of its strong susceptibility to interference from local letters even when these are irrelevant to the task. Phonological features played a crucial role in this interference because the interference was entirely maintained also when letters at the global and local level were presented in different uppercase vs. lowercase formats. In contrast, when local features conveyed no phonological information, the left hemisphere showed preserved global processing abilities. These findings were supported by the study of the right brain damaged patient. These results offer a new look at the hemispheric dominance in the attentional processing of the global and local levels of hierarchical stimuli.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.12.013,,Attention; Global; Hemispheric; Local; Navon stimuli; Specialization,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Follow-up imaging of this opioid-associated amnestic syndrome (OAS) has revealed persistent hippocampal abnormalities. Given these observations, as well as neuropathological studies demonstrating excessive tau deposition in the hippocampi and other brain regions of individuals with opioid misuse, we describe longitudinal imaging of a patient with a history of OAS from presentation through 53 months later, when tau positron emission tomography (PET) was performed. Our patient was a 21-year-old woman with a history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorder, including opioids (intravenous heroin), who was hospitalized for acute-onset, dense anterograde amnesia. Her urine toxicology screen was positive for opiates. On presentation, her brain MRI showed restricted diffusion as well as T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity of the hippocampi and globi pallidi. On day 3, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a right hippocampal region of interest showed a mild reduction of N-acetyl aspartate/creatine, slight elevation of choline/creatine, and the appearance of lactate/lipid and glutamate/glutamine peaks. At 4.5 months, there was resolution of restricted diffusion on MRI, although a minimal anterior T2 and FLAIR hyperintense signal in the right hippocampus persisted. However, by 53 months, when mild memory loss was reported, the hippocampi appeared normal on MRI, and [ 18 F]T807 (tau) PET showed no uptake suggestive of tau deposition.

Neurophysiological studies in animals and brain imaging studies in humans suggest that such filtering depends on top-down inputs to extrastriate visual areas, originating in structures important for attentional control. To test whether the posterior parietal cortex may be a necessary source of signals that filter distractors, we measured the ability of a patient with bilateral parietal lesions to discriminate the features of a target surrounded by distractors of variable contrast. In the presence of distractors, the patient was impaired at discriminating both grating orientation and faces, and the magnitude of the impairment increased with distractor salience. These attentional deficits are remarkably similar to those caused by damage to monkey extrastriate regions V4 andor TEO, which are thought to be recipients of top-down attentional feedback. In contrast to the effects of V4 and TEO lesions, however, the parietal lesions impaired performance even with widely spaced targets and distractors, a finding consistent with the projections of parietal cortex to visual processing areas covering a wide range of receptive field sizes and eccentricities.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.0730772100,PMC153081,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Patients with cerebellar damage show marked impairment in the acquisition of procedures, as revealed by their performance on the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Here we present the case of a patient affected by ischemic damage involving the left cerebellum who showed a selective deficit in procedural learning while performing the SRTT with the left hand. The deficit recovered when the cortical excitability of an extensive network involving both cerebellar hemispheres and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was decreased by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Although inhibition of the right DLPFC or a control fronto-parietal region did not modify the patient's performance, inhibition of the right (unaffected) cerebellum and the left DLPFC markedly improved task performance. These findings could be explained by the modulation of a set of inhibitory and excitatory connections between the lateral cerebellum and the contralateral prefrontal area induced by rTMS. The presence of left cerebellar damage is likely associated with a reduced excitatory drive from sub-cortical left cerebellar nuclei towards the right DLPFC, causing reduced excitability of the right DLPFC and, conversely, unbalanced activation of the left DLPFC. Inhibition of the left DLPFC would reduce the unbalancing of cortical activation, thus explaining the observed selective recovery of procedural memory.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Although neglect has been observed following damage to a variety of brain structures, to date no reports exist of neglect phenomena arising from Huntington's Disease (HD). However, reports in the animal and human literature suggest that neglect is possible following damage to a primary site for Huntington's pathology, the basal ganglia. Here we present a patient (BG) with genetically proven HD who, in the context of the mild intellectual, executive and attentional impairments associated with the disorder, showed a remarkably severe and stable neglect for left space. MRI and electrophysiological results make it unlikely that the spatial bias could be accounted for by basic sensory loss. In addition, behavioural investigation indicated that, although BG's neglect operated in a very striking manner along body-centred co-ordinates (missing almost all information presented to her left), more general limitations in visual attention were apparent to the left-side of information presented entirely to the right of the body midline. Further evidence is presented showing that the neglect was manifest on tactile and auditory tasks as well as those presented in the visual domain. The presence of neglect in HD in this case is novel and somewhat puzzling, particularly as flourodeoyglucose positron emission tomography revealed bilateral caudate hypoperfusion. Reducing the statistical threshold on this analysis revealed a potential frontal hypometabolism that was more marked in the right than left hemisphere. However, as this was only apparent at a threshold below that normally considered acceptable (due to the resulting number of false positives), this possible account of the neglect must be viewed very cautiously.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.3.261.15559,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The patient (VA) could not match spoken letters to their graphic form. A preserved ability to recognize shape and canonical orientation of letters indicates intact access to the representation of letters and numbers as visual objects. A relatively preserved ability to match lowercase to uppercase letters suggests partially spared access to abstract letter identities independently of their visual forms. The patient was also unable to match spoken letters and numbers to their visual form, indicating that she could not access the graphemic representations of letters from their phonological representations. This pattern of performance suggests that the link between graphemic and phonological representations is disrupted in this patient.

11569896,Auditory laterality and attentional deficits after thalamic haemorrhage.,"Wester, K; Irvine, D R; Hugdahl, K",Wester,"Thalamic lesions have been shown to produce severe cognitive deficits involving language and memory. A majority of the studies have reported cognitive deficits after lesions in the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei. We report five case studies of effects on language processing after postero-dorsal thalamic haemorrhages. Four of the patients had lesions on the right side, and one patient had a lesion on the left side. Effects on language processing were investigated with the dichotic listening test with consonant-vowel syllables. This test, in which conflicting auditory stimuli are presented simultaneously to the two ears, has been used to probe differences in language processing in the left and right hemispheres. The four patients with right-sided lesions reported almost none of the syllables presented to the left ear, and were unable to modify this massive right ear advantage by directing attention to the left or right ear. The patient with a left-sided lesion showed a weaker left ear advantage, and was able to modify his responses by shifting attention, to an extent similar to that of healthy reference individuals. When tested with monaural stimulus presentation, the scores of all patients rose to almost 100% correct for each ear. The pattern of effects with dichotic stimuli under different instructional conditions cannot be accounted for in purely structural terms, and indicates that lesions in the posterior part of the thalamus, including the pulvinar nucleus and medial geniculate body, produce deficits not only in processing of complex auditory stimuli but also in the allocation of attention to input from one ear or the other.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s004150170113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Nevertheless, she provided higher intensity scores for disgusted words and her responses in the lexical decision task were significantly delayed for these stimuli. In addition, MB's response times were not differently influenced by the presence of irrelevant emotional faces. However, she explicitly identified fewer facial expressions of disgust and she assessed them as significantly less intense.

32426021,A case report of mania with abnormal cerebral blood flow and cognitive impairment 24 years after head trauma.,"Yoshino, Hiroki; Aoki, Chieko; Kitamura, Soichiro; Yamamuro, Kazuhiko; Tanaka, Shohei; Kishimoto, Toshifumi",Yoshino,"Mania usually occurs secondary to organic etiologies such as head trauma within a short time of the primary condition's onset; however, there have been a few cases reported in the literature of long time spans before the manifestation of mania. The orbitofrontal cortex has been reported to be associated with manic states in bipolar disorder and with mania-inducing lesions. Head trauma commonly disrupts various cognitive functions, including attention and information processing. Traumatic brain injury patients have been shown to have greater posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus functional connectivity to the rest of the default mode network. We describe a case of secondary mania after head trauma 24 years ago with low blood flow in the orbitofrontal cortex, high blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex, and impaired cognitive functioning, including impaired attention and lowered processing speed. We describe a 30-year-old Japanese man with secondary mania and a medical history of head trauma 24 years ago. After head trauma at 6 years of age, the patient first showed apathy as a sign of frontal lobe impairment. After recovering, he experienced no psychiatric problems during adolescence, although he did show disinhibited behavior. At the onset of mania, low blood flow in the OFC and high blood flow in the PCC were observed as well as impaired cognitive function, including inattention and lowered processing speed. Abnormal cerebral blood flow was less prominent and cognitive dysfunction was partially recovered following recovery from mania, but his processing speed remained low. Although functional recovery from head trauma in childhood is better than that in adulthood, the brain may remain vulnerable for a long time. The risk of psychotic symptoms such as mania should be considered, even if sufficient superficial brain functional recovery is shown.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of general psychiatry,10.1186/s12991-020-00282-7,PMC7218518,"Brain injuries, traumatic; Manic state; Orbitofrontal cortex; Posterior cingulate cortex",Case Reports,England,eng

20600184,Impaired fixation to eyes following amygdala damage arises from abnormal bottom-up attention.,"Kennedy, Daniel P; Adolphs, Ralph",Kennedy,"SM is a patient with complete bilateral amygdala lesions who fails to fixate the eyes in faces and is consequently impaired in recognizing fear (Adolphs et al., 2005). Here we first replicated earlier findings in SM of reduced gaze to the eyes when seen in whole faces. Examination of the time course of fixations revealed that SM's reduced eye contact is particular pronounced in the first fixation to the face, and less abnormal in subsequent fixations. In a second set of experiments, we used a gaze-contingent presentation of faces with real time eye tracking, wherein only a small region of the face is made visible at the center of gaze. In essence, viewers explore the face by moving a small searchlight over the face with their gaze. Under such viewing conditions, SM's fixations to eye region of faces became entirely normalized. We suggest that this effect arises from the absence of bottom-up effects due to the facial features, allowing gaze location to be driven entirely by top-down control. Together with SM's failure to fixate the eyes in whole faces primarily at the very first saccade, the findings suggest that the saliency of the eyes normally attract our gaze in an amygdala-dependent manner. Impaired eye gaze is also a prominent feature of several psychiatric illnesses in which the amygdala has been hypothesized to be dysfunctional, and our findings and experimental manipulation may hold promise for interventions in such populations, including autism and fragile X syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.06.025,PMC2949539,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11561029,Conflict and integration of spatial attention between disconnected hemispheres.,"Ishiai, S; Koyama, Y; Furuya, T",Ishiai,"To clarify how the disconnected hemispheres perceive a line and bisect it with successful or unsuccessful integration of spatial attention. Eye movements were recorded when a patient with an extensive callosa infarction bisected horizontal lines. The lesion extended into the left cingulate gyrus. When the patient bisected lines with the right hand, the gaze was initially directed rightward and shifted further to the right side with the execution of manual response, which resulted in rightward errors. Shortly after bisection, rapid ocular searches occurred to the left side, whereas the rightward errors did not decrease throughout the trials. When using the left hand, there was no deviation of the gaze before presentation of lines. In the first few trials, the patient bisected the line with a leftward error and then searched rapidly to the right side. The subsequent bisections were almost accurate, as the subjective midpoint was placed near the point of the initial fixation that fell around the true centre. Ocular searching was mostly absent during and after line bisection. In callosa disconnection, left unilateral spatial neglect may appear when use of the right hand induces a rightward bias in the attentional control of the left hemisphere and damage to its cingulate gyrus inhibits interhemispheric integration of attention. Resultant rightward errors of line bisection often cause interhemispheric conflict of attention, as the right hemisphere perceives the longer extent on the left side. By contrast, the disconnected but intact right hemisphere may bisect a line accurately by integrating attention to the extents perceived in the left and right visual fields.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.71.4.472,PMC1763536,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

23603022,Body ownership and attention in the mirror: insights from somatoparaphrenia and the rubber hand illusion.,"Jenkinson, Paul M; Haggard, Patrick; Ferreira, Nicola C; Fotopoulou, Aikaterini",Jenkinson,"The brain receives and synthesises information about the body from different modalities, coordinates and perspectives, and affords us with a coherent and stable sense of body ownership. We studied this sense in a somatoparaphrenic patient and three control patients, all with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. We experimentally manipulated the visual perspective (direct- versus mirror-view) and spatial attention (drawn to peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space) in an experiment involving recognising one's own hand. The somatoparaphrenic patient denied limb ownership in all direct view trials, but viewing the hand via a mirror significantly increased ownership. The extent of this increase depended on spatial attention; when attention was drawn to the extrapersonal space (near-the-mirror) the patient showed a near perfect recognition of her arm in the mirror, while when attention was drawn to peripersonal space (near-the-body) the patient recognised her arm in only half the mirror trials. In a supplementary experiment, we used the Rubber Hand Illusion to manipulate the same factors in healthy controls. Ownership of the rubber hand occurred in both direct and mirror view, but shifting attention between peripersonal and extrapersonal space had no effect on rubber-hand ownership. We conclude that the isolation of visual perspectives on the body and the division of attention between two different locations is not sufficient to affect body ownership in healthy individuals and right hemisphere controls. However, in somatoparaphrenia, where first-person body ownership and stimulus-driven attention are impaired by lesions to a right-hemisphere ventral attentional-network, the body can nevertheless be recognised as one's own if perceived in a third-person visual perspective and particularly if top-down, spatial attention is directed away from peripersonal space.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.03.029,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here we present the very unusual case of a patient with right hemisphere damage and signs of left visual neglect, who, when presented with visual stimuli, confabulated both for consciously undetected and for consciously detected left-sided details. Advanced anatomical investigation suggested a disconnection between the parietal and the temporal lobes in the right hemisphere. A disconnection between the ventral cortical visual stream and the dorsal fronto-parietal networks in the right hemisphere may contribute to confabulatory behaviour by restricting processing of left-sided stimuli to pre-conscious stages in the ventral visual stream.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-018-5281-8,,Confabulation; Implicit knowledge; Neglect,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
17354375,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
22847398,Cognitive decline and hypersomnolence: thalamic manifestations of a tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF).,"Morparia, Neha; Miller, Gary; Rabinstein, Alejandro; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Kumar, Neeraj",Morparia,"Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) often present with pulsatile tinnitus, orbital congestion, and headache. Occasionally, they present with focal neurologic deficits, a dementia-like syndrome, hemorrhage, or ischemic infarction. This study is based on the case of a 71-year-old gentleman who presented with 6 months of progressive forgetfulness, inattention, and hypersomnolence. Four weeks prior to presentation, he developed symptoms of left-sided pain, numbness, and worsening weakness. Neurologic examination demonstrated hypersomnolence, a score of 30/38 on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and left hemiparesis. MRI brain revealed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities with associated enhancement. MR venogram (MRV) showed a vascular malformation in the posterior fossa and occlusion of the straight sinus. Conventional cerebral angiogram confirmed a tentorial dAVF. The dAVF was definitively treated with transarterial embolization, followed by clip ligation of the arterialized draining vein. Twelve weeks later, there was clinical resolution of left hemiparesis and improvement in cognitive status. MRI revealed complete resolution of the thalamic hyperintensities. MRV demonstrated recanalization of the straight sinus. Intracranial dAVFs are uncommon but potentially life-threatening acquired vascular malformations. The initiating factor is venous hypertension, causing retrograde flow, venous congestion, ischemia, and sometimes infarction. The spectrum of clinical manifestations in dAVFs reflects the degree of venous congestion present. If retrograde venous flow is surgically obliterated, then venous hypertension may be reversible. Bilateral thalamic venous congestion can present as a thalamic dementia. We conclude that intracranial dAVFs with thalamic venous congestion should be considered in the diagnostic differential for patients who present with subacute cognitive decline and T2 hyperintense thalamic signal change.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9746-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In addition to a spatial deficit, such patients have also been reported to have a non-spatial deficit in temporal processing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these spatial and temporal deficits might be linked if the right temporal-parietal cortex is important in integrating spatial and temporal attention. In AF, a patient with an acute right temporal-parietal stroke, we replicated previous observations showing that he was biased to judge ipsilesional stimuli as occurring before contralesional stimuli. More importantly, for vertically aligned stimuli, AF more accurately judged the temporal order of successive ipsilesional than contralesional stimuli. Furthermore, his contralesional performance improved with stimuli with larger vertical separations. Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence that right temporal-parietal damage produces a processing refractory period for stimuli in contralesional space that extends in both space and time. These findings are in agreement with other studies that suggest that the right temporal-parietal cortex is important in integrating the where and when of stimuli.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.003,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Postsurgical high resolution MRI revealed bilaterally shrunken mammillary bodies and an infarct of the left mammillary body. There were no other relevant lesions. Neuropsychological testing showed mildly impaired frontal lobe functions (executive functions, working memory and word fluency), almost intact learning and recognition, but severely impaired free and delayed recall.

The two community-dwelling adults each had post-ABI attention and memory deficits and anxiety. A-B-A single-case experimental design was employed for this study. The transportation route was stepped into multiple steps. Each step was scored in a unique way to determine the degree of assistance the participant received from others. This score was considered the main outcome. Tau-U analysis was used for statistical analysis. Statistically significant improvements in public transportation use were shown between baseline and intervention. There were no significant differences between the intervention and follow-up periods.

In particular, the functional contribution of subcortical regions to PM is still unknown. This study was aimed at investigating the role of the medial subdivision of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (mMDT) in PM, with particular focus on the processes that are mediated by the projections from/to this structure. We analysed the performance of a patient (OG) with a right-sided lesion involving the mMDT in a series of PM tasks that varied for focality (i.e., overlapping of processes for the PM and ongoing tasks) and emotional valence of the stimuli, comparing the patient's performance with that of a control group. We found that the mMDT damage led to deficits in PM that were modulated by focality and emotional valence. OG indeed showed: a greater cost in the ongoing performance when a non-focal PM task was added; a slowing down in retrieving the intentions, in particular when these were associated with focal PM cues; an abnormal performance in the task with positive PM cues. Our findings provide evidence of a contribution of mMDT to PM and suggest a modulation of prefrontal-dependent strategic monitoring and a possible interaction with the limbic structures in the integration of emotion and PM processes. They also give support to the still controversial idea that connections with the perirhinal cortex mediate familiarity-based recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1111/jnp.12154,,emotion; focality; mediodorsal thalamus; prospective memory; recognition,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

For eye movements, the gap effect was disrupted, and abnormal saccade metrics occurred, with reflexive eye movements being disrupted moreso than voluntary eye movements. Each of these effects resolved coincident with thiamine treatment. The covert attention task revealed a complete absence of IOR.

The present single case study evaluates the time course and longitudinal stability of attention improvement after alertness training by repeatedly testing the subject between individual training sessions as well as one and seven months after the end of the training. The outpatient (M.P.) trained developed severe alertness deficits following brainstem encephalitis in 2003 without signs of cortical damage, and since then had not achieved full recovery. In 2008, M.P. participated in 15 treatment sessions on 15 separate working days over a period of three weeks. In each session a 45-minute alertness training task was administered, using the CogniPlus ALERT computer training program. Attention performance was assessed by neuropsychological tests four years, one year, and immediately before the therapy after every third training session and three times after the termination of therapy. Furthermore, a self-report questionnaire measured subjective experience of attention in everyday life situations. In order to compare the performance between training sessions, a procedure specialised for psychometric single-case diagnosis was used to analyse the data. Surprisingly, even after three consecutive training sessions, M.P. showed immense improvement in alertness. Furthermore, after two weeks she felt more energetic and more able to concentrate. Six months after the end of the training the improvement remained stable. The unexpectedly fast time course of recovery induced by the training, as well as the stable long-term effects, probably depend on intact cortical structures. In M.P. it appeared that top-down control of the alertness network on impaired brainstem arousal structures had been re-activated by the training procedure and had remained stable across a long time period.",{},,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2010.541792,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This unilateral auditory agnosia was first associated with a right motor underutilization and right motor, sensitive, visual and auditive extinctions. Speech discrimination scores were 100% with the left ear and 15% with the right ear, even less in dichotic conditions. Tonal audiogram, as well as early and late components of the auditory evoked potentials were normal. Cerebral regional perfusion and metabolism were impaired over the left parietotemporal area. There was severe hypoactivation of the left hemisphere with right monaural verbal stimulations. Rehabilitation consisting of non-specific attention tasks and repetitions of words reaching only the right ear was undertaken 15 months after the stroke. The oral language comprehension improved, as did the left hemisphere activation, and the extinction phenomena disappeared, except for the auditory one. The unilaterality of the auditory agnosia could be due, in part, to a peculiar physiological processing in this patient, such as poor performance of his right ipsilateral auditory pathway which could be improved with practice. A striatal lesion could induce a spatial hemi-inattention as reflected by the multimodal extinction in this case. Besides, a lack of selective activation for verbal stimulation of the left hemisphere is suggested.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

The neuropsychological deficits following these selected lesions, the nature of the clinical memory disorder, and the neuroanatomy of memory are discussed. The significance of cortical/subcortical relationship in explaining observed behavioral changes is emphasized. Brain damage with maximum involvement in the dorsomedial nuclei and mamillothalamic tracts appears to cause primarily a memory disorder and frontal-limbic behavioral changes, the severity and profile of deficits depending on lesion extent and location. Both anterograde and remote memory loss may be present.

Although GDB is frequently disrupted after acquired brain injury, few studies have addressed the remediation of reduced GDB in patients with severe brain injury. The present study aimed to raise this question in RZ, a patient with severe brain injury who presented a serious reduction in GDB related to difficulties in creating an intention from internal determinants and in selecting an action plan, as well as to memory and attentional impairments. Our objective was to investigate the efficacy of an intervention programme to create and trigger a specific intention in RZ. More specifically, this programme consisted in written prompts, first accompanied by an alarm provided by his mobile phone, but gradually reduced until only the alarm remained, which was implemented in order to improve RZ's attendance at workshop sessions. Results showed that RZ's attendance rate at the workshop sessions increased, indicating that the use of an external device allowed us to create and trigger intention in a patient with severe cognitive impairments.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2016.1255230,,Goal-directed behaviour; external device; intention; rehabilitation; single-case experimental design,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

At the time of testing, the patient had a complete left visual field deficit but only a very slight left hemiparesis. Under conventional testing conditions, line bisection performed with the right hand showed more severe left neglect than when performed with the left hand. This pattern of performance could, however, be modified, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by changing the starting position of the patient's hand when bisecting horizontal lines. The results suggest that spatio-motor cueing has a more profound effect upon task performance than does differential hemispheric activation per se. We also provide a demonstration that, in a normal subject, the starting position of the hand is likewise a crucial determinant of task performance. In this case, however, there is also an interaction between the hand (and hence hemisphere) deployed and the position of that hand in space.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(91)90018-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This allows neurons to localize a near sound with respect to the head. In the present study, we demonstrated the existence of an auditory peripersonal space around the head in humans. In a right-brain damaged patient with tactile extinction, a sound delivered near the ipsilesional side of the head extinguished a tactile stimulus delivered to the contralesional side of the head (cross-modal auditory-tactile extinction). In contrast, when an auditory stimulus was presented far from the head, cross-modal extinction was dramatically reduced. This spatially specific cross-modal extinction was found only when a complex sound like a white noise burst was presented; pure tones did not produce spatially specific cross-modal extinction. These results show a high degree of functional similarity between the characteristics of the auditory peripersonal space representation in humans and monkeys. This similarity suggests that analogous physiological substrates might be responsible for coding this multisensory integrated representation of peripersonal space in human and non-human primates.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.2.97,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Although his neglect is severe on such tasks as line bisection, cancellation, and drawing, there are some domains of preserved perceptual performance: he can perceive subjective contours, he can use lateral symmetry as a cue to figure-ground segregation, and he benefits from some forms of global cueing. In a series of five experiments, we show that R.B. has a selective inability to analyse and copy accurately the left contours of geometric nonsense-figures. These results hold even when there is a single vertical contour (to be copied) that divides a rectangle or a circle into two sub-figures; this physically-identical boundary is copied more accurately when it is cued as the right edge of the left sub-figure than when it is cued as the left edge of the right sub-figure. These effects are not influenced by a manipulation in which R.B. is required to trace the outline of the relevant sub-figure with his finger immediately prior to drawing his copy. The results are interpreted in terms of classical Gestalt theories of figure-ground assignment. Pre-attentive (global) figure-ground parsing is basically intact; but when focal attention is demanded, only the right side of an object is coded as figure.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)90151-1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We propose that impaired SWM can exacerbate visual neglect, due to failures in remembering locations that have already been searched. When combined with an attentional bias to the ipsilesional right side, such a SWM impairment should induce recursive search of ipsilesional locations. Here we studied a left neglect patient with a right temporoparietal haemorrhage. On a nonlateralised, purely vertical SWM task, he was impaired in retaining spatial locations. In a visual search task, his eye position was monitored while his spatial memory was probed. He recursively searched through right stimuli, re-fixating previously inspected items, and critically treated them as if they were new discoveries, consistent with the SWM deficit. When his recovery was tracked over several months, his SWM deficit and left neglect showed concurrent improvements.

We compare their performance to that of ten control subjects and relate these findings to the efficiency of processing seen and heard speech in separate and combined modalities.

We discuss the performance of one such subject on a number of tasks and evaluate standard arguments for attributing aspects of his performance to a morphological processing deficit. Although there are several features of his performance that are suggestive in this regard; we argue that, when these issues are addressed in the context of a sufficiently elaborated theory of lexical processing, a morphological processing deficit cannot be demonstrated. We also survey a number of recent reports that purport to provide evidence for a morphological processing deficit and argue that, in most cases, they fail to support such claims for similar reasons. An important moral to be drawn from a critique of these studies is that in order to make valid inferences concerning the role of morphology in organizing the lexicon, we must consider these errors in the context of theories of the lexicon that take seriously the effects of converging lexical factors in processing.",{},,Brain and language,10.1016/0093-934x(87)90129-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng
11287368,Two types of auditory neglect.,"Bellmann, A; Meuli, R; Clarke, S",Bellmann,"Auditory neglect, defined as inattention to stimuli within the left hemispace, is mostly reported in association with left ear extinction in dichotic listening. However, it remains disputed as to how far dichotic extinction reflects a primary attentional deficit and is thus appropriate for the diagnosis of auditory neglect. We report here on four patients who presented left ear extinction in dichotic listening following right unilateral hemispheric lesions. Auditory spatial attention was assessed with two additional tasks: (i) diotic test by means of interaural time differences (ITDs), simulating bilateral simultaneous spatial presentation of the dichotic tasks without the inconvenience of interaural intensity or content difference; and (ii) sound localization. A hemispatial asymmetry on the ITD diotic test or a spatial bias on sound localization were found to be part of auditory neglect. Two patients (J.C.N. and M.B.) presented a marked hemispatial asymmetry favouring the ipsilesional hemispace in the ITD diotic test, but did not show any spatial bias in sound localization. Two other patients (A.J. and E.S.) had the reverse profile: no hemispatial asymmetry in the ITD diotic test, but a severe spatial bias directed to the ipsilesional side in sound localization. J.C.N. and M.B. had mainly subcortical lesions affecting the basal ganglia. A.J. and E.S. had cortical lesions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal areas. Thus, there are two behaviourally and anatomically distinct types of auditory neglect characterized by: (i) deficit in allocation of auditory spatial attention following lesions centred on basal ganglia; or (ii) distortion of auditory spatial representation following frontotemporoparietal lesions.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.4.676,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

To test this hypothesis, patients with focal lesions of either the parietal or frontal cortex or both and normal controls were studied using a paradigm known as Troxler fading. Accordingly, if one fixates on a centrally located stimulus and attends to a stationary stimulus in peripheral vision, the peripheral stimulus quickly fades from awareness (i.e. Troxler fading: Troxler [Verschwinden, unseres, Opthal, Vol. 2, pp. 51-53. Fromann, Jena, 1804]). Movement of the peripheral stimulus on the retina normally prevents Troxler fading. Results indicated that patients with parietal lesions not only reported accelerated Troxler fading but also reported fading of moving peripheral stimuli contralateral to their brain lesion. In contrast, patients with frontal lesions rarely reported Troxler fading. In one patient with a left parietal and a right frontal lobe lesion fading was hemi-spatially dissociated, being accelerated in right hemispace but absent in left hemispace.

Normal subjects were slower on invalid trials in the 8 degrees as compared to 2 degrees condition. Patients with right-hemisphere stroke with neglect were slower in their responses to left-sided invalid targets compared to valid targets, and demonstrated a significant increase in the effect of target validity as a function of target eccentricity. Additional data from one neglect patient (JM) demonstrated an exaggerated validity x eccentricity x side interaction for contralesional targets on a cued reaction time task with a central (arrow) cue. We frame these results in the context of a continuous 'moving spotlight' model of attention, and also consider the potential role of spatial saliency maps.

We hypothesized that AM could automatically process positive, but not negative evaluative information and could process both types of evaluative information using controlled processing. In Phase 1 of Experiment 1 AM and controls were shown a series of words one at a time and were required to make good/bad judgments as quickly as possible. Results showed that AM was more likely than controls to rate words as good, and was significantly slower to make good/bad judgments of negatively, but not positively, evaluated words. In Phase 2 AM was shown a prime (positive or negative) then target (positive or negative) and instructed to evaluate whether the target word was good or bad. Results showed that AM responded more quickly when prime and target were both positive, but not when prime and target were both negative, whereas controls showed both types of priming. Experiment 2 determined whether AM's impaired processing of negative evaluative information could be abolished under controlled processing. AM was explicitly instructed to generate positive and negative connotations of a series of single words and given essentially unlimited time. Under these conditions, AM and controls did not differ significantly in their ability to generate positive versus negative connotations of words. In Experiment 3 AM and controls both showed normal semantic priming effects.

Studies that focus on treatment options for inpatients with such behaviours are scarce. There is limited guidance on how to approach therapy that will maximize the patient's tolerance and participation and how to measure meaningful progress. This case study describes how the use of an innovative treatment approach to improve attention was beneficial in rehabilitation of a patient with severe traumatic brain injury whose profound behaviour disturbances substantially precluded participation in traditional therapies. The study shows how rehabilitation utilizing an interactive virtual reality-robotics environment that minimized distractions was associated with improved engagement in therapy, decreased disruptive behaviour during treatment and more sensitive measurement of progress. These results may be instructive in how technology can be used to modify therapy sessions to make them accessible to patients with profound behaviour disturbance and how meaningful progress can be measured even in the absence of gains in traditional metrics.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.793399,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

We asked both healthy participants as well as a patient with simultanagnosia to perform different visual search tasks of variable difficulty. We also modulated the number of objects (target and distracters) presented. For healthy participants, we found that each visual search task was performed with a specific ""attentional field"" depending on the difficulty of visual object processing but not on the number of objects falling within this ""working space."" This was demonstrated by measuring the cost in reaction times using different gaze-contingent visible window sizes. We found that bilateral damage to the superior parietal lobule impairs the spatial integration of separable features (within-object processing), shrinking the attentional field in which a target can be detected, but causing no deficit in processing multiple objects per se.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/bhv059,,feature integration; parallel; posterior parietal cortex; serial; simultanagnosia,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

However, accumulating evidence shows that neglect can also follow lesions of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) that do not directly affect this parietal-frontal network. Surgical studies in the monkeys have demonstrated that complete callosal resection combined with lesion of the right optic tract entirely deprives the right hemisphere of visual inputs from the left hemispace provoking severe left unilateral neglect. Here, through the detailed study of two patients we show, for the first time, that PCA lesions selectively affecting the splenium of the corpus callosum and the adjacent right primary visual cortex provoke severe neglect selectively restricted to the visual domain. No trace of personal, motor or representational-imagery neglect was found. Also at variance with previous case studies in which neglect followed lesion of the trunk or the genu of the corpus callosum, no restriction of neglect to tasks performed with the right hand, no left hemispatial limb akinesia, no tactile extinction for the left hand and no tactile anomia for stimuli explored with the left hand were observed. These findings demonstrate that brain lesions depriving intact parietal and frontal attentional areas from specific sensory inputs can yield spatial neglect limited to specific sensory modalities or sectors of space.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-010-2230-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

To investigate the possible consequences of such lesions on social cognition, we tested a selected patient, MVG, a 44-year-old man with a focal caudate nucleus (CN) lesion following stroke. In the aftermath of this stroke, MVG shows loss of empathy and difficulties recognizing emotions in others. The dual aims of this study were first, to evaluate the implications of CN on ToM and recognition of emotion, and second, to discuss these results as a consequence of a disconnection of the sub-cortical orbito-frontal (OF) loop due to caudate damage. We performed a complete neuropsychological assessment of MVG, as well as different tasks evaluating social cognition, such as the Faux-Pas Test and the Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test. No deficits were found in the neuropsychological tests. However, on tasks assessing social cognition, MVG showed impairments in the ""warm"" or ""affective"" part of ToM as well as in the ability to recognize negative emotions (i.e., sadness and fear). These results indicate that damage to the head of the left CN can lead to impairment of ToM and emotion recognition. Furthermore, the data shows that, in MVG, such impairment appears to be due to a disconnection of the sub-cortical OF circuit resulting from damage to the CN. Neuro-imaging data tends to confirm this hypothesis by bringing out a hypo-perfusion in both, the territory of his left CN and prefrontal (i.e., ventromedial) brain areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.01.004,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

2390236,Unawareness of visual and sensorimotor defects: a hypothesis.,"Levine, D N",Levine,"A theory is proposed to account for unawareness of blindness, hemianopsia, and hemiplegia, and for phantom limb after amputation. It is assumed that interruption of a sensory pathway at any level--from peripheral nerve to primary sensory cortex--is not associated with any immediate sensory experience that uniquely specifies the defect. Instead the sensory loss must be discovered by a process of self-observation and inference. Discovery is easy for defects that create major functional disability, such as total blindness. Hence unawareness of total blindness occurs only in association with severe intellectual impairment, precluding the required self-observation and inference. In contrast, hemianopsia is difficult to discover because several mechanisms automatically compensate the defect effectively. Thus unawareness of hemianopsia is common, even in intellectually normal individuals. Insensate fields are often the source of suggested (false) percepts, because no information from such a field specifies the absence of a sensory stimulus. The most powerful source of suggestion is sensory activity in uninvolved portions of the affected sensory field. Thus hemianopsics may perceive complete geometric forms when only incomplete forms are shown and the missing portion falls in the hemianopsic fields. Such perceptual completion also occurs in hemianesthetic hemiplegics, creating the illusion that there are normally functioning limbs on the affected side. This perceptual completion increases the difficulty of discovery of hemianesthetic hemiplegia, but the disability is still sufficiently obvious that some additional cognitive impairment is invariably present in patients with lasting unawareness of hemiplegia. Phantom limb after amputation is the product of perceptual completion without associated cognitive impairment. The patient with phantom limb is thus aware of the illusory quality of his phantom. Some insight into the neural basis of perceptual completion and of unawareness of sensory loss may derive from considering sensory systems and associative cortex as parallel-distributed processing mechanisms.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(90)90052-p,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Action blindsight illustrates visuo-motor abilities despite the patients' feeling that they produce random movements. Perception blindsight seems to be the weakest residual function observed in blindsight, e.g. for wavelength sensitivity. Discriminating motion produced by isoluminant colours does not give rise to blindsight for motion but the outcome of the reciprocal test is not known. Here we tested whether moving stimuli could give rise to colour discrimination in a patient with homonymous hemianopia.

This is suggested by patients who recognize the global form of the left side of shapes (the forest) but fail to cancel out its local details (the trees). Here we report the opposite behavioural dissociation in a patient (Q.M.) with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. Q.M. detected local details (such as the tail of a dog) on the left or right side of visual shapes, regardless of whether these details belonged to predefined target shapes (a dog in this case) or to distractor shapes differing on the opposite side (a dog with a swan's neck and head, for example). Psychological testing showed an abnormal tendency of this patient to respond to local features, but perfect accuracy in interpreting global features when the local features could not interfere in global processing.

21807010,Numbers and time doubly dissociate.,"Cappelletti, Marinella; Freeman, Elliot D; Cipolotti, Lisa",Cappelletti,"The magnitude dimensions of number, time and space have been suggested to share some common magnitude processing, which may imply symmetric interaction among dimensions. Here we challenge these suggestions by presenting a double dissociation between two neuropsychological patients with left (JT) and right (CB) parietal lesions and selective impairment of number and time processing respectively. Both patients showed an influence of task-irrelevant number stimuli on time but not space processing. In JT otherwise preserved time processing was severely impaired in the mere presence of task-irrelevant numbers, which themselves could not be processed accurately. In CB, impaired temporal estimation was influenced by preserved number processing: small numbers made (already grossly underestimated) time intervals appear even shorter relative to large numbers. However, numerical estimation was not influenced by time in healthy controls and in both patients. This new double dissociation between number and time processing and the asymmetric interaction of number on time: (1) provides further support to the hypothesis of a partly shared magnitude system among dimensions, instead of the proposal of a single, fully shared system or of independent magnitude systems which would not explain dissociations or interactions among dimensions; (2) may be explained in terms of a stable hierarchy of dimensions, with numbers being the strongest.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.014,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

With the exception of the following abnormalities visual functions were normal. First, there was a decrease in the critical flicker frequency in the periphery (but not in the parafoveal region) of the right visual hemifield, that is, that contralateral to the pulvinar lesion. However, the second and most striking characteristic was--as shown by presenting visual stimuli bilaterally and simultaneously-a 'neglect' for the periphery of this contralateral visual half-field. This 'neglect' was a function of (a) position in the visual field (eccentricity), (b) stimulus properties (size and luminance), (c) temporal properties (length of presentation and interstimulus interval). In addition to this reduced capacity to detect stimuli appearing in the periphery of the right visual hemifield, there was also prolonged latency of visually evoked saccadic eye movements and a paucity of spontaneous eye movements directed towards the right visual hemifield. These results are interpreted in terms of a contribution of the n. pulvinar to the detection of light stimuli presented in the periphery of the visual field, and support the view that the tectopulvinar extrastriate visual pathway plays an important role in the control of visual attention.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/102.4.835,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The deficits associated with ipsilesional neglect have not been as well characterized. Because cueing may be used as a rehabilitative assistive device, we wanted to learn whether the efficacy of an attentional or intentional cue was related to the type of bias. We studied a patient with a right frontotemporal stroke who had ipsilesional neglect by using a video apparatus that dissociates sensory-attentional and motor-intentional systems. We also performed a cueing experiment with primarily sensory-attentional cues (i.e., read the letter at the end of the line) and primarily motor-intentional cues (i.e., touch the end of the line). Ipsilesional neglect was primarily a motor-intentional deficit with a motor-action bias to the left and a secondary sensory-attentional bias for stimuli to the right. With cueing we found a double dissociation: the rightwards motor-intentional cue improved the primary left-sided intentional bias and the leftwards sensory-attentional cue improved the secondary right-sided attentional bias. Effective rehabilitation strategies need to address both sensory-attentional and motor-intentional deficits in patients with neglect.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.53.9.2017,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

The video containing dynamic landscape of natural scene or cities but not human/animals was used as the protocol B. The ""ABA"" training procedure for 3 weeks therefore allows us to internally control the individual differences. Before and after each week of training, the Chinese behavioral inattention test- Hongkong version (CBIT-HK) was implemented to evaluate the hemispatial neglect severity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment was implemented in two health subjects to reveal the difference of brain activation between protocol A and B. The results showed that protocol A rather than protocol B significantly improved the CBIT-HK scores at first and third weeks, respectively. Protocol A induced more bilateral activations including right inferior parietal lobe (supramarginal gyrus), which belongs to MNS and is also critical region resulting to hemineglect. MNS activation can provide a novel therapy for hemispatial neglect patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Scientific reports,10.1038/srep08664,PMC4345335,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Functional analyses (FA) of antecedent and consequent conditions related to PCB were conducted to determine controlling influence of: (a) content of verbal interaction and, (b) social reinforcement. After isolating the controlling variables, the functioned-based intervention was implemented in 60 minute tutoring sessions. A reversal condition was used to demonstrate experimental control of the behavior during tutoring sessions. PVB which occurred in the context of tutoring for an undergraduate course significantly interfered with the delivery of instruction. Multiple replications of the functional relation between social reinforcement and PVB duration was demonstrated using an A-B-A-B reversal design during functional analysis and tutoring conditions. PVB markedly declined, but did not extinguish over the course of weekly tutoring (extinction) sessions, most likely due to 'bootleg reinforcement' occurring in other situations. Results indicate that perseverative verbal behaviour following closed head injury may be strongly influenced by the social contingencies operating in various contexts and is amenable to applied behaviour analysis interventions.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2016.1183170,,Brain injury; applied behaviour analysis; functional analysis of behaviour; verbal perseveration,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
23473288,The effect of repeated sessions of galvanic vestibular stimulation on target cancellation in visuo-spatial neglect: preliminary evidence from two cases.,"Zubko, Olga; Wilkinson, David; Langston, Deborah; Sakel, Mohamed",Zubko,"In recent years it has emerged that the attentional disorder of visuo-spatial neglect can be overcome via artificial stimulation of the balance system. One means of achieving this is via galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), a simple procedure in which tiny, electrical currents are discharged to the part of the scalp overlying the vestibular nerves. Attempts to remediate neglect with GVS have utilized only a single session of stimulation and, although this can induce spontaneous recovery, symptoms resurface soon after stimulation. This study assessed whether repeated sessions induce longer carry-over. Two individuals diagnosed with neglect post-stroke received 5 days of sub-sensory, left anodal GVS. Performance was assessed via the letter and star cancellation tasks of the Behavioural Inattention Test on four occasions; 3 days before the start of stimulation, on the first and last day of stimulation and 3-days after stimulation. Analyses of variance indicated that both participants missed significantly fewer targets in both tasks on the fifth day of stimulation compared to baseline. More so, this improvement was still evident at follow-up 3 days later. The results strengthen the need for a larger, sham-controlled trial to establish whether repeated GVS provides lasting relief from neglect.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.767938,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

7497101,Anosognosia in parietal lobe syndrome.,"Ramachandran, V S",Ramachandran,"Patients with right parietal lesions often deny their paralysis (anosognosia), but do they have ""tacit"" knowledge of their paralysis? I devised three novel tests to explore this. First, the patients were given a choice between a bimanual task (e.g., tying shoe laces) vs a unimanual one (e.g., threading a bolt). They chose the former on 17 of 18 trials and, surprisingly, showed no frustration or learning despite repeated failed attempts. I conclude that they have no tacit knowledge of paralysis (or, if such knowledge exists, it is not available for this particular task). Second, I used a ""virtual reality box"" to convey the optical illusion to the patient that she was moving her paralyzed left hand up and down to the rhythm of a metronome, and yet she showed no sign of surprise. Third, I irrigated patient BM's left ear canal with cold water, a procedure that is known to shift that patient's spatial frame of reference by stimulating the vestibular system. Surprisingly, this allowed her ""repressed"" memory of the paralysis to come to the surface; she said she had been paralyzed continuously for several days. I suggest that the vestibular stimulation produces these remarkable effects by mimicking REM sleep. These patients also employ a whole arsenal of grossly exaggerated Freudian ""defense mechanisms"" to account for their paralysis. To explain this, I propose that in normal individuals the left hemisphere ordinarily deals with small, local anomalies by trying to impose consistency but, when the anomaly exceeds threshold, an interaction with the right hemisphere forces a ""paradigm shift."" A failure of this process, in patients with right hemisphere damage, might partially account for anosognosia. Finally, I present a new conceptual framework that may help link several psychological and neurological phenomena such as Freudian defense mechanisms, vestibular stimulation, anosognosia, memory repression, visual illusions, anterograde amnesia, REM sleep, dreaming, and humor.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1006/ccog.1995.1002,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

It remains however unclear whether the VA span deficit and the deficits in temporal and spatial attention shifting also reported in dyslexic children reflect a unitary spatio-temporal deficit of attention - probably linked to general posterior parietal dysfunction- or the dysfunction of distinct attentional systems that relate to different neural substrates. We explored this issue by testing an adult patient, IG, with a specific damage of the bilateral superior parietal lobules after stroke, on tasks assessing the VA span as well as temporal and spatial attention shifting. IG demonstrated a very severe VA span deficit, but preserved temporal attention shifting. Exogenous spatial orientation shifting was spared but her performance was impaired in endogenous attention. The overall findings show that distinct sub-systems of visual attention can be dissociated within the parietal lobe, suggesting that different attentional systems associated with specific neural networks can be selectively impaired in developmental dyslexia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.001,,Brain damage; Developmental dyslexia; Endogenous and exogenous spatial attention; Superior parietal lobule; Visual attention; Visual attention span,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The pre-saccadic facilitation of perceptual discrimination at the location of a saccadic goal (paradigm of Deubel and Schneider, 1996) has been considered as an argument for this theory. We compared letter discrimination performance in a saccade (overt attention - pre-saccadic facilitation) and a fixation (covert attention) task in a patient with right posterior parietal damage and 4 controls. In the overt attention condition, the patient was instructed by a central cue to make a saccade to a target located at a peripheral location. During the saccade latency (in a period of time of 250 msec following the presentation of the cue), a letter was presented at the target location. Accuracy of leftward saccades was impaired compared to rightward saccades. To evaluate letter discrimination performance in this saccade task (i.e., the presence of pre-saccadic facilitation), we selected only those leftward saccades that were equivalent in accuracy (and latency) to the rightward ones. Within these selected trials, the patient was able to discriminate letters equally well in both visual fields. In contrast, he performed at chance level during the fixation task (covert attention condition) for letters presented at the same peripheral location with the same timing with respect to the cue presentation. The patient could thus discriminate the letter presented at 8° of visual eccentricity while he was preparing a saccade, whereas he was unable to perceive the letter in the fixation task. Remarkably, in the left visual field, letter discrimination was impossible even when a letter was presented as close as 2.5° of visual eccentricity in the fixation task. Altogether, these results suggest that pre-saccadic perceptual facilitation does not rely on the same processes as those of covert attention, as tested by fixation task. Instead, we propose that pre-saccadic perceptual facilitation results from a form of attention specific to action, which could correspond to a pre-saccadic remapping process.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2009.06.014,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

A 38-year-old man with refractory dystonic head tremor underwent bilateral implantation of quadripolar DBS electrodes in the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus. He benefited markedly from chronic DBS. At age 46 he was admitted with head and neck pain, attention deficits and sensory disturbances. Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a subcortical tumor originating from the right pulvinar. Surgery was performed with neuronavigation guidance and the tumor was subtotally removed. The neuropathological examination revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma WHO Grade I. Postoperative MRI demonstrated a small remnant tumor without increase in size during 1 year follow-up after adjuvant radiation therapy. He had ongoing benefit of his tremor with continued DBS. To our knowledge, there have been only three case reports published before indicating such a co-occurrence. In all of these reports, the tumors were high-grade gliomas. It is estimated that about 160.000 patients have been treated with DBS worldwide to date. Even if one would take into account that glial tumors would develop only with chronic DBS after several years and that a significant number of patients didn't reach such long term follow-up the resulting probability of brain tumor development most likely wouldn't be higher as the expectation of mere coincidence.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2019.04.008,,Deep brain stimulation; Dystonia; Dystonic tremor; Glioma; Pilocytic astrocytoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

It has been argued that to a large extent these bisection errors can be attributed to a perceptual change whereby the patient experiences the left half of a line as shorter than the right half, causing them to set the midpoint of the line towards the right. We describe here a patient with a left hemisphere lesion and rightward neglect, who consequently makes bisection errors in a leftward direction. We carried out a series of tests which confirmed that he shows a subjective visual distortion in the converse direction, i.e. a perception of horizontal extents on the right as shorter than extents on the left. We also found that he shows a similar distortion in his tactile perception. The association of visual and tactile distortions in this patient is compatible with the view that the distortion effects have a rather high-level origin.

The present case concerns a 42-year-old white male who in January 1989 suffered a closed head injury. A thorough personal history as well as a detailed examination of the patient's daily activities allowed us to account for the unusual manner in which the sundowning manifested itself.

For example, pictures with higher frequency names are named faster and more accurately than those with lower frequency names. Experiments with normal participants and patients strongly suggest that this production effect arises at the level of lexical access. Further work has suggested that within lexical access this effect arises at the level of lexical representations. Here we present patient E.C. who shows an effect of lexical frequency on his nonword error rate. The best explanation of his performance is that there is an additional locus of frequency at the interface of lexical and segmental representational levels. We confirm this hypothesis by showing that only computational models with frequency at this new locus can produce a similar error pattern to that of patient E.C. Finally, in an analysis of a large group of Italian patients, we show that there exist patients who replicate E.C.'s pattern of results and others who show the complementary pattern of frequency effects on semantic error rates.

When such errors affect the left sides of words, they are usually produced by patients with focal right hemisphere lesions who typically show evidence of left neglect in non-reading tasks. This pattern has thus been termed ""neglect dyslexia"". When the right sides of words are affected, however, patients frequently fail to show any signs of neglect in tasks other than reading. This study presents results from a patient with left hemisphere damage, and a very clear pattern of right ""neglect"" errors in reading, on a series of tasks testing attentional and imagery processes. Given the magnitude and consistency of the patient's reading errors, there was little evidence that these errors resulted from inattention to the right side of space or to the right side of an internally generated visual image.

After her accident, her driving license was revoked. Despite recovering normal neuropsychological functions in the following years, MC was unable to renew her license, failing four on-road evaluations assessing her fitness to drive. In hope of an eventual license renewal, MC went through an in-simulator training programme in the laboratory in 2009. The training programme aimed at improving features of MC's driving behaviour that were identified as being problematic in prior on-road evaluations. To do so, proper driving behaviour was reinforced via driving-specific feedback provided during the training sessions. After 25 sessions in the simulator (over a period of 4 months), MC significantly improved various components of her driving. Notably, compared to early sessions, later ones were associated with a reduced cognitive load, less jerky speed profiles when stopping at intersections and better vehicle control and positioning. A 1-year retention test showed most of these improvements were consistent. The learning principles underlying well conducted simulator-based education programmes have a strong scientific basis. A simulator training programme like this one represents a promising avenue for driving rehabilitation.

We also explored whether APT-II training would enhance RW's auditory comprehension, other cognitive abilities such as memory, and his and his spouse's perceptions of his daily attention and communication difficulties. With treatment, RW improved on trained attention tasks and made modest gains on standardized tests and probes that evaluated cognitive skills related to treatment activities.

One disputed issue is whether conflict detection and error monitoring can be viewed as unitary functions performed by the same region of the ACC, or whether these processes can be dissociated functionally and anatomically. We used a combination of electrophysiological and neuropsychological methods to assess these competing hypotheses. A neurological patient with a rare focal lesion of rostral-to-middorsal ACC was tested in an event-related potential study designed to track the time course of neural activity during conflicts and erroneous responses. Compared with controls, the error-related negativity component after incorrect responses was attenuated in the patient, accompanied by lower error-correction rates. Conversely, the stimulus-locked component on correct conflict trials, the N450, was enhanced, and behavioral performance was impaired. We hypothesize that intact regions of lateral prefrontal cortex were able to detect response conflict, but damage to the dorsal ACC impaired response inhibition, which may be due to disconnection from cingulate and supplementary motor areas. The results implicate rostral-dorsal ACC in error monitoring and suggest this function can be dissociated from conflict-detection processes.","DictElement({'Year': '2002', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2002,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.252521499,PMC138615,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

It is unknown, however, whether these two frames are represented independently in the brain and if so, which areas (or networks) of the brain are responsible for each frame of reference. To determine whether body-centered neglect and stimulus-centered neglect can be dissociated in patients with brain injury. New figure discriminative cancellation tasks were designed to simultaneously assess body-centered neglect and stimulus-centered neglect. Two neglect patients with lesions located in different anatomic regions were required to circle every complete figure and to cross out every figure with a missing portion on a sheet of white (29.7 x 42 cm) paper. Patient 1 omitted leftward stimuli on the paper, but the stimuli he found were correctly circled or crossed out. On the other hand, Patient 2 marked stimuli across the paper although he mistakenly circled stimuli that were missing a portion of their left side. Neither patient manifested interaction between the two types of neglect. The results of this study clearly showed double dissociation between the two types of neglect. Furthermore, it not only provides evidence that there are two distinct systems of reference frame for external space in the human brain, but also adds new knowledge indicating that these two systems function independently, at least in part.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.57.11.2064,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

A careful analysis of symptoms indicated PFC dysfunction that could be attributed to lesions in the ascending monoaminergic brainstem systems. Interestingly, the cognitive symptoms improved after treatment with methylphenidate, which is a drug that modules catecholaminergic neurotransmission, thereby supporting this hypothesis.

When traumatic brain injury occurs, there is a natural desire to find some measure that identifies the amount of damage that has occurred and whether it is permanent or temporary. Given the popularity of the IQ test, there is a tendency to use this measure as such a yardstick. It is argued that such a global measure is not appropriate. The predominant reason that it is not a wise choice is that IQ test does not tap into many of the critical areas of a person's functioning, such as personality regulation, shorter-term memory, various types of attentional capacity, and the ability to organize and plan effectively. Rather, to truly and accurately reflect a person's neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses requires the use of many different measures, not just a single one such as an IQ score.",{},,The Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The initial left-sided infarct induced right visual neglect, impairment of right-beating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optic ataxia, Gerstmann's syndrome and apraxia. After the right-sided infarct, which occurred six weeks later, bilateral visuo-oculomotor disturbances were observed, including peripheral visual inattention, disorder of visually guided saccades, severe impairment of foveal smooth pursuit and OKN slow phase. The lesion on the left involved the upper part of the angular gyrus and a part of the adjacent superior parietal lobule (SPL). That on the right involved the supramarginal gyrus and extended posteriorly into the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, into both margins of the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and into a small part of the SPL. As the oculomotor deficits and the peripheral visual inattention were bilateral after the second infarct, they probably resulted from the lesion of homologous areas in both cerebral hemispheres. The zone damaged in common included a small part of the SPL, the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, and the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and a small portion of the subcortical white matter. This restricted cerebral zone could therefore, in man, be implicated both in the control of all visually guided eye movements and in visual attention. It is further suggested that two corticofugal pathways are implicated in visually guided saccades, the first arising from the frontal eye fields and projecting directly onto the premotor structures in the brainstem, the second arising from the posterior parietal cortex (probably mainly the intraparietal sulcus adjacent to the angular gyrus) and including a relay in the superior colliculus before reaching the premotor structures. Lastly, the findings support the hypothesis that optic ataxia results from interruption of direct and/or crossed occipitofrontal pathways coursing in the deep white matter of the parietal lobe.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/109.1.81,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It results most frequently from right-hemisphere brain damage, particularly of the parietal lobe but also of the frontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, and recently it has also been described after a cerebellar lesion. We report a patient with right-sided bleeding of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, who developed a left-sided visual hemi-inattention. She had no visual field defects, yet she had problems detecting left-sided targets in visual extinction. Furthermore, she was impaired in detecting complex motion on the left side and targets in a fixation offset paradigm. Reactions to left-sided targets in covert shifts of attention were slowed in the invalid condition. Her text reading was impaired as she could not always find the initial word of the next line. However, she was aware of her deficit. Her visuoconstructive ability was normal and she gave no indication of tactile or acoustic extinction. As the cerebellar lesion was located in the right hemisphere and the inattention involved the left side of space, we suggest that the damage to the right brain stem led to a transient imbalance of the noradrenergic ascending activation system which may explain her hemi-inattention.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.8.3.323.16197,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Either on spontaneous drawing or when the number sequence was provided by the experimenter, C.B. drew a clockface with left-sided numbers transposed to the right side of the dial. By contrast, when each number was drawn on a separate dial, its location was correct and there was no transposition.

It is proposed that a deficit in disengaging attention from right-sided visual stimuli plays a critical role in some forms of number transpositions.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)00106-y,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To test this prediction, tactile detection tasks were administered to two subjects with right hemisphere lesions. Subject CB's left tactile extinction was investigated in conditions in which the degree of contact between the right and left hands and the spatial relationship between his hands was systematically varied. His left tactile extinction was significantly reduced by touch of the right hand. Similarly, extinction at the left knee was ameliorated by touch of the knee by the right hand; touch of the right foot had no effect. Subject NC's ability to detect a tactile stimulus delivered to the left side was systematically assessed in conditions in which the hands touched and the spatial relationship between the hands was varied. His ability to detect a touch on the left hand improved in conditions in which the left hand was touched by the right hand. This effect was not observed if direct contact between the two hands was prevented by inserting a thin cloth between the hands. For both subjects, placing the right hand in close proximity to the left hand or altering the spatial location of the hands relative to the body did not influence performance. These data demonstrate that the hand may serve as a conduit for attention and provide strong evidence for a distinct representation of the body surface that is at least in part independent of spatial representations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.06.002,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,England,eng

PW showed a problem in executive control of semantic processing, where he could not easily override automatic but irrelevant semantic processing. This case, thus, shows the necessary role of the right inferior prefrontal cortex in executive semantic processing.

22824728,The impairment of recollection in functional amnesic states.,"Markowitsch, Hans J; Staniloiu, Angelica",Markowitsch,"Functional amnesia refers to various forms of amnesia, which have no direct organic brain basis. Psychological stress and trauma were etiologically linked to its development across various cultures. We have studied several patients with functional amnesia, employing neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Herein we provide a review of the current understanding of the phenomenology, neuropsychology and neurobiology of functional amnesia, which we illustrate by reference to five own case descriptions and other cases presented in the literature. Functional amnesia is mostly of retrograde nature and presents in the form of a memory blockade or repression to recollect episodic-autobiographical events, which may cover the whole past life. Sometimes, the recollection impairment is localized to certain time epochs. In comparison to functional retrograde amnesia, functional isolated anterograde amnesia is much rarer and data on its neurobiology are scant. In patients with functional amnesia with pronounced retrograde episodic-autobiographical memory impairments, we identified changes in brain metabolism, above all reductions in the temporo-frontal regions of the right hemisphere. Recently, even subtle structural changes in the white matter of the (right) frontal cortex were described in functional retrograde amnesia by other researchers. The disruption in recollection in functional amnesia is often accompanied by changes in personality dimensions, pertaining to cognition (self-related processing, theory of mind), autonoetic consciousness and affectivity. This suggests that functional amnesia is a multifaceted condition. We hypothesize that the recollection deficit in functional retrograde amnesia primarily reflects a desynchronization between a frontal lobe system, important for autonoetic consciousness, and a temporo-amygdalar system, important for evaluation and emotions. Despite assumptions that functional amnesia can always be reversed, several cases of functional amnesia were found to follow a chronic course, suggesting a need for longitudinal prospective studies to quantify possible global cognitive deterioration over time and its neural underpinnings.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.05.020,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Monkeys learned the task readily, but after bilateral removal of the banks and floor of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) they failed to perform the task efficiently. This result is consistent with the conclusion, based on recordings from single cells in awake, behaving monkeys [Perret et al., Physiological Aspects of Clinical Neuro-ophthalmology, Chapman & Hall, London, 1988] that this region of the temporal lobe is important for coding information about eye-gaze of a confronting animal. Human subjects were given identical stimuli in a task where they were asked to detect ""the face that is looking straight at you"". Human performance is sensitive to the degree of angular deviation from the frontal gaze position, being poorest at small angular deviations from 0 degrees. This was also true of monkeys viewing these stimuli, pre- and post-operatively. Compared with normal controls, two humans prosopagnosics were impaired at this task. However the extent of impairment was different in the two patients. These findings are related to earlier reports (including those for patients with right-hemisphere damage without prosopagnosia), to normal performance with upright and inverted face photographs, and to notions of independent subsystems in face processing.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(90)90050-x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The changes in two subjects who had suffered from cerebral infarction shown throughout a 3-week mental imagery programme were described.

After completing the programme, the subjects showed improvements in performance at both the trained and untrained tasks. Feedback from the patients also suggested its ability to enhance their day-to-day functioning. Clinical assessment results indicated that the subjects experienced an increase in the attention and sequential processing functions but not in the motor and other cognitive functions. Mental imagery appears to be effective at enhancing the task relearning of subjects after brain injury. The skills acquired under this treatment regime can be retained and then generalized to other tasks. Its therapeutic effect is probably mediated by the improved attention and planning and execution functions associated with the rehearsal. Further research should conduct clinical controlled trials to gather evidence on its efficacy at promoting functional regain in people suffering from neurological disorders.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050410001671883,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In the left visual field (/right hemisphere), performance was no better than chance level at first, but then improved dramatically across stimulation blocks, in each of five successive sessions.

The aim of the second experiment was to determine some conditions under which this pattern was obtained. The experimental design contrasted stimuli (words and pictures) and representational activity (phonologic and visuo-imaged processing). The right visual field (/left hemisphere: LH) elicited higher performance than the left visual field (/right hemisphere, RH) in the three situations where verbal activity was required. No superiority could be found when visual images were to be generated from pictures: parallel and weak improvement of both hemispheres was observed across sessions.

Here we report a unique patient suffering from extensive bilateral destruction of the auditory cortices (including the primary auditory fields) who demonstrated conscious perception of the onset and offset of sounds only when selectively attending to the auditory modality. This is the first description of such an attentively modulated 'deaf-hearing' phenomenon and its neural correlates, using H(2)(15)O-PET. Increases in cerebral blood flow associated with conscious awareness of sound that was achieved by listening attentively (compared with identical auditory stimulation presented when the patient was inattentive) were found bilaterally in the lateral (pre)frontal cortices, the spared middle temporal cortices and the cerebellar hemispheres.

Several studies have investigated this capability by determining if social cues, such as eye gaze direction, can influence the allocation of visual attention. When a viewer sees a face looking to the left, the viewer's attention is allocated in the gazed-at direction. These 'social attention' studies have asked if this allocation of attention is automatic or under voluntary control. In this paper, we show that a patient with frontal-lobe damage is impaired at allocating attention to peripheral locations voluntarily, although attention can be allocated there automatically. The patient, EVR, can use peripheral cues to selectively process one location over another but cannot use symbolic cues (words) to allocate attention. EVR is also impaired in using eye gaze cues to allocate attention, suggesting that 'social attention' may involve frontal-lobe processes that control voluntary, not automatic, shifts of visuospatial attention.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.009,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

On the other hand, the effect arose even when the cue was always invalid. We suggest that information from the cue competed with the top-down set to determine search.

Though behavioral progress was found for a number of areas, she remained deficient, especially in long-term memory. The severest and largely modality-nonspecific deficits were observed in recall (as opposed to recognition) situations. As a peculiar finding which we would attribute to septal damage, H.I. was mainly affected in tests containing emotional (especially emotionally negative) stimuli, or certain flavours. While this involvement might have helped her in memorizing material judged as positive, it was of negative influence under other circumstances. The septal area may serve as an interface contributing a specific combination of emotional flavour and evaluating (feedback) judgement to a larger (septo-hippocampal-amygdalar) memory and learning processing network.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(93)90065-8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Dysexecutive syndrome and inattention, for example, alongside a number of other cognitive and behavioural impairments such as memory loss and lack of motivation, significantly affect day-to-day functioning following TBI. This study examined the efficacy of video modelling in emerging speech in an adult male with TBI caused by an assault. In an effort to identify functional relations between this novice intervention and the target behaviour, experimental control was achieved by using within-system research methodology, overcoming difficulties of forming groups for such an highly non-homogeneous population. Across a number of conditions, the participant watched a videotape in which another adult modelled a selection of 19 spoken words. When this modelled behaviour was performed in vivo, then generalization across 76 other words in the absence of a videotape took place. It was revealed that video modelling can promote the performance of previously learned behaviours related to speech, but more significantly it can facilitate the generalization of this verbal behaviour across untrained words. Video modelling could well be added within the rehabilitation programmes for this population.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.809550,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Simple visuospatial perceptual and orientation abilities, emotional expression, and face recognition, also ""right-hemispheric"" functions, are normal. It is postulated that the right hemisphere, if isolated in infancy, has the potential to take over most cognitive functions.

Based on these observations it was also suggested that singing might improve speech production. However, recent experimental studies with aphasic patients found no evidence to illustrate that singing improves word production under controlled experimental conditions. This study investigated the role of singing during repetition of word phrases in a patient severely affected with non-fluent aphasia (GS) who had an almost complete lesion of the left hemisphere. GS showed a pronounced increase in the number of correctly reproduced words during singing as compared to speaking excerpts of familiar lyrics. This dissociation between singing and speaking was not seen for novel song lyrics, regardless of whether these were coupled with an unfamiliar, a familiar, or a spontaneously generated melody during the singing conditions. These findings propose that singing might help word phrase production in at least some cases of severe expressive aphasia. However, the association of melody and text in long-term memory seems to be responsible for this effect.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.01.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In previous research we have argued that problems with the regular past tense in patients with left inferior frontal damage arise from morpho-phonological parsing difficulties [Trends in Cognitive Science 2 (1998) 428]. This claim has recently been challenged by a single mechanism connectionist account which argues that a general phonological processing deficit causes the poor performance on the regular past tense, with morphological factors playing no explicit role [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 96 (1999) 7592]. We used a speeded judgement task with four patients who have documented difficulties with the regular past tense to contrast the claims made by these different approaches. We compared patients' ability to detect the difference between the past tense and stem of regular (hugged/hug) and irregular (taught/teach) past tense verbs, as well as matched ""pseudo"" pairs (trade/tray and port/peach). These real word conditions were accompanied by matched sets of non-words (e.g. nugged/nug). Patients' latencies to the regular past tense real word-pairs were consistently slower than in any other condition. To test for a general phonological processing deficit, we conducted several tests of phonological processing ability. The results show that the patients had a range of difficulties in phonological processing, from very mild to severe. This did not correlate with their performance on the speeded judgement task. We interpret this pattern of results as support for a specialised morpho-phonological processing mechanism which can be dissociated from other phonological processes and which is used directly in the processing of the regular past tense in a dual-mechanism system.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00232-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Recent studies have suggested that lesion of white-matter pathways plays an important role in producing spatial neglect by causing a widespread functional breakdown of the network of cortical and subcortical structures that regulates orienting of spatial attention. Nonetheless, this conclusion is largely based on the study of patients who suffer combined grey and white matter damage and should be better corroborated by the study of cases with selective or predominant white matter dysfunction. Here, we describe the clinical and MRI follow-up of a patient who suffered left spatial neglect due to inflammatory Acute Disseminated Encephalo-Myelitis (ADEM) that affected the white matter. Recovery from neglect was matched with recovery from inflammatory white-matter dysfunction, despite a concomitant and progressive increase in cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation. These findings confirm the role of white matter lesion/dysfunction in the pathogenesis of left spatial neglect.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.04.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Due to largely normal behavioral test results in two patients with medial prefrontal lesions, a hypothesis has been advanced claiming that the ACC is not involved in cognitive operations. In the current study, two comparably rare patients with unilateral lesions to dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encompassing the ACC were assessed with neuropsychological tests as well as Event-Related Potentials in two experimental paradigms known to engage prefrontal cortex (PFC). These included an auditory Novelty Oddball task and a visual Stop-signal task. Both patients performed normally on the Stroop test but showed reduced performance on tests of learning and memory. Moreover, altered attentional control was reflected in a diminished Novelty P3, whereas the posterior P3b to target stimuli was present in both patients. The error-related negativity, which has been hypothesized to be generated in the ACC, was present in both patients, but alterations of inhibitory behavior were observed. Although interpretative caution is generally called for in single case studies, and the fact that the lesions extended outside the ACC, the findings nevertheless suggest a role for MPFC in cognitive control that is not restricted to error monitoring.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2012.07.008,PMC4067454,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The patient developed psychomotor agitation, unresponsive to a combination of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Brain MRI showed a small established cerebellar infarction. Electroencephalogram was normal. Tests for toxic metabolic encephalopathy were negative. One oligoclonal IgG bands was found in the Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was not observed in corresponding serum, but cell count and protein were normal. Extensive testing for infectious encephalitis was unremarkable. CSF testing for commercially available neural and non-neural autoantibodies was negative. The patient fulfilled the Gultekin diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and methylprednisolone IV 1g/d for 5 days was given. He recovered rapidly, with progressive improvement in memory and psychomotor agitation. After treatment commenced, results for antibodies to mGluR5 in CSF taken prior to treatment were returned as positive. mGluR5 is found on post-synaptic terminals of neurons and microglia and is expressed primarily in the hippocampus and amygdala. This case highlights the difficulties in diagnosing this type of encephalitis: the CSF did not show pleocytosis, the MRI showed only chronic change and the electroencephalogram was normal. The dramatic recovery after methylprednisolone help to better characterized the clinical spectrum of auto-immune encephalitis. Diagnosing anti mGlutR5 encephalitis may lead to potentially highly effective treatment option and may anticipate the diagnostic of a cancer. A high index of suspicion is needed to avoid missed diagnosis. In patients with unexplained encephalitis, testing for antibodies to mGluR5 in CSF and serum should be considered. When there is a reasonable index of suspicion of auto-immune encephalitis, treatment should not be delayed for the antibody results.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2018.02568,PMC6230718,Hodgkin's lymphoma; Ophelia syndrome; encephalitis; limbic encephalitis; metabotropic glutamate receptor 5,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

Testing at treatment baseline revealed performance that was generally in the high average range or higher on measures of reaction time and attention, with a selective impairment in verbal learning (borderline to extremely low range). Following 8 weeks of abstinence from marijuana, his verbal learning recovered to expected levels (high average range), with signs of improved learning strategy, efficiency, rate, and capacity. However, his reaction time and attention showed minimal evidence of change.

The patient can see a single stimulus presented in the ipsilesional or contralesional visual field, but is characteristically unaware of the same contralesional stimulus during simultaneous stimulation of both fields. The ipsilesional stimulus is said to 'extinguish' the contralesional stimulus from awareness during bilateral stimulation, perhaps due to a pathological bias in attention towards the ipsilesional side. Recent psychophysical evidence suggests that, although extinguished stimuli are not consciously seen, they may undergo residual processing and exert implicit effects on performance. However, the neural structures mediating such residual processing for extinguished stimuli remain unknown. Here we studied the neural activity evoked by an extinguished visual stimulus, using event-related functional MRI (fMRI), in a patient with circumscribed right inferior parietal damage and profound left-sided extinction. Monochrome objects (faces or houses) were presented in the left or right field, either unilaterally or bilaterally on each trial, with the patient indicating by button press whether he saw an object on the left, the right or on both sides. He usually saw only the right object on bilateral trials, yet the fMRI data showed activation of visual cortex contralateral to the extinguished left stimulus on these trials (compared with right-only stimulation), in both striate and early extrastriate areas of the right hemisphere. This activity had a similar location and time-course to that resulting from a single stimulus in the left versus right visual field. Cortical pathways involved in the normal processing of a single seen stimulus can thus still be activated by an unseen, extinguished stimulus after right parietal damage. Comparison of fMRI responses for faces versus houses revealed some category-specific activation for extinguished stimuli in right fusiform regions, but only at low statistical threshold. These results are discussed in terms of theoretical accounts for parietal extinction and, more generally, for the neural substrates of visual awareness.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/123.8.1624,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Although reflexive glances were observed under these conditions they occurred more frequently in response to contralesional stimuli than ipsilesional ones. Furthermore, the patient had no difficulty in performing anti-point movements with his ipsilesional hand. Thus, his inability to suppress reflexive glances on the anti-saccade task is not due to a generalised problem of ""distractibility"".

The present research aimed to study neglect in situations where attentional resources are limited due to multitasking. We examined two patients more than 3 years after a right-hemispheric stroke. Both had received neuropsychological rehabilitation for left neglect and did not show any impairment in standard tests. We used a dual-task paradigm combining a peripheral target detection task with a central shape recognition task. Peripheral targets could appear in left/right positions but also in lower/upper positions. In patient #1, dual-task condition exacerbated left neglect and extinction. Patient #2 did not show any sign of neglect along the horizontal axis, but omitted half of the lower targets when they were presented simultaneously with upper targets under dual-task condition. This behavior reflects altitudinal extinction as the detection of single targets appearing either in upper or lower position was preserved.

Instead it was shown that when vestiges of word meaning remained, a lexical response was preferred, but when meaning was lost entirely, the evidence derived from sublexical processing appeared to bias selection of the response towards the regularized form.",{},,"The Quarterly journal of experimental psychology.

In these works Grodzinsky contends that his account, which is based in various ways on the formal apparatus of current syntactic theory (Chomsky, 1981), is an accurate and explanatory characterization of the preserved language of all those who present with both agrammatic sentence production and asyntactic sentence comprehension. We argue that this claim is not in accord with the facts. We present a detailed case study of the sentence comprehension performance of a patient who is clinically categorized as agrammatic. This patient's performance on full and truncated passives, and on subject- and object-cleft sentences fails each of Grodzinsky's predictions for these sentence types. We argue that whether there exists any patient who does exhibit the predicted performance pattern is also in serious doubt.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80136-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Italy,eng
2579971,Neuropsychological analysis of a case of reduplicative paramnesia.,"Patterson, M B; Mack, J L",Patterson,"Following a right cerebral hemispheric CVA, a patient showed extensive reduplication of place (his hospital) and occasional reduplication of person. His language was essentially intact, but he was deficient on tests of conceptualization and on nonverbal tasks, both visual and auditory. Short- and long-term memory for nonverbal but not verbal material were also impaired. However, he had sufficient ""memory"" for the reduplicated hospitals to comment that they were spatially identical. He simply seemed unable to treat these memories as representing the same phenomena. Neuropsychological analysis suggest that reduplicative paramnesia represents a combination of perceptual and memory deficits as well as impaired ability to integrate information.",{},,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/01688638508401245,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
1720717,Crossed anomic aphasia: mild naming deficits following right brain damage in a dextral patient.,"Hadar, U; Ticehurst, S; Wade, J P",Hadar,"A detailed case study is reported of crossed aphasia (CA) in a dextral patient, bearing upon such controversial issues as intrahemispheric localisation of language function and hemispheric reversal of nonverbal function. DA, a man aged 37, developed a mild naming problem due to right temporal lobe haematoma. Apart from a mild acquired stutter, his continuous speech was fluent and had a normal proportion of open to closed class lexical items. His naming deficit appears to originate in the 'blocking' or 'disconnection' of the phonological lexicon: he could usually give a functional definition of un-named items and retrieve them with the help of a phonemic cue. Lexical retrieval appears his only language deficit, as he had no comprehension or phonological discrimination deficits. DA showed no visuo-spatial or auditory-nonverbal deficits, suggesting the complete reversal of hemispheric specialisation.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80042-1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
15929901,Chronic neuropsychological sequelae of cholinesterase inhibitors in the absence of structural brain damage: two cases of acute poisoning.,"Roldán-Tapi, Lola; Leyva, Antonia; Laynez, Francisco; Santed, Fernando Sánchez",Roldán-Tapi,"Here we describe two cases of carbamate poisoning. Patients AMF and PVM were accidentally poisoned by cholinesterase inhibitors. The medical diagnosis in both cases was overcholinergic syndrome, as demonstrated by exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors. The widespread use of cholinesterase inhibitors, especially as pesticides, produces a great number of human poisoning events annually. The main known neurotoxic effect of these substances is cholinesterase inhibition, which causes cholinergic overstimulation. Once AMF and PVM had recovered from acute intoxication, they were subjected to extensive neuropsychological evaluation 3 and 12 months after the poisoning event. These assessments point to a cognitive deficit in attention, memory, perceptual, and motor domains 3 months after intoxication. One year later these sequelae remained, even though the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were interpreted as being within normal limits. We present these cases as examples of neuropsychological profiles of long-term sequelae related to acute poisoning by cholinesterase inhibitor pesticides and show the usefulness of neuropsychological assessment in detecting central nervous system dysfunction in the absence of biochemical or structural markers.",{},,Environmental health perspectives,10.1289/ehp.7545,PMC1257603,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
2713142,"On the different roles of the cerebral hemispheres in mental imagery: the ""o'Clock Test"" in two clinical cases.","Grossi, D; Modafferi, A; Pelosi, L; Trojano, L",Grossi,"This paper develops the hypothesis of different roles of the two hemispheres in imaginal processes. A test designated the ""o'Clock Test"" is proposed, which contains closely confrontable perceptual and imaginal tasks. It enables examination of the abilities both to generate mental images and to explore them in their right and left halves (R + L Condition). This test was used to examine two patients, one severely affected by hemi-inattention resulting from a right posterior lesion, and the other with a selective deficit of imagery due to a left occipital lesion. The former demonstrated left neglect in both perceptive and imaginal capacities, while the latter was able to perform correctly only the perceptive tasks. These results suggest that the right hemisphere has functions of organization and spatial exploration at both perceptive and imaginal levels, and that the left hemisphere's role is to generate mental images.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(89)90072-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The present study of a subject with left visual neglect compared left hand finger movement with an instruction to visually anchor perception on the left arm during letter cancellation. Only the finger movements significantly reduced neglect. Another comparison was between ""out of sight"" finger movements of the left hand in left and right hemispace, respectively. Only left hemispace ""blind"" finger movements significantly reduced neglect compared to the standard condition. Thirdly, blind left finger movements in left hemispace were compared with passive visual cueing (reading a changing number) and again it was found that only the finger movements reduced neglect. Finally, right finger movements in left hemispace were compared with left finger movements in left hemispace: only the latter reduced neglect. The implications of these findings for theory and therapy of neglect are discussed.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(92)90058-t,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Her first stroke was centered in the right frontal lobe and resulted in left hemi-spatial neglect but only for tasks that emphasize exploratory-motor components of directed attention. A second stroke occurred 20 days later in the parietal lobe and led to the emergence of perceptual-sensory aspects of neglect. This case strongly supports the existence of a distributed anatomic-functional network subserving directed attention.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410280119,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
17228775,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

39156286,Concussion May Result in New-Onset Bipolar Disorder: A Case Report.,"Sabatose, Kent W; Cufino, Nichole; Hahn, Wendy; Ibatullin, Murat",Sabatose,"Emotional dysregulation following a concussion is well established. New onset of major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) post-concussion has not been investigated. BPD typically presents with an initial depressive episode followed by mania and concurrent depressive and manic states. Multiple theories explaining the etiology of BPD exist, including the diathesis-stress model (DiSM), though an accepted theory is not established. In this case study, medical records of a 50-year-old ambidextrous male with co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and a family history of BPD suffered a motor vehicle collision (MVC) resulting in a grade II concussion. New onset BPD was diagnosed one-year after a concussion following an involuntary admission and led to the patient self-terminating his medications and suffering a hypertensive crisis and aortic dissection, and stroke. One year later, the patient was again involuntarily admitted for a suicide attempt. Bipolar disorder persisted unchanged indefinitely. This case study may serve as a real-world example of the DiSM in the etiology of BPD post-concussion. We aim to highlight the importance of early identification of risk factors for progression to psychiatric conditions following concussion.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.64731,PMC11329324,adult concussion recovery; bipolar disorders; brain and bipolar disorder; concussion applications; diathesis stress model; diffuse axonal injury and traumatic brain injury; post traumatic brain injury; white matter injury and traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
