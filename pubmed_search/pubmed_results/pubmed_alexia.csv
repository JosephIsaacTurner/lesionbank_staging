36370599,Right hemi-alexia.,"Barton, Jason Js; Rubino, Cristina; Albonico, Andrea; Jackson, MaryLou; Davies-Thompson, Jodie",Barton,"While pure alexia was long considered a disconnection syndrome, it may also be a selective visual word agnosia due to damage to the visual word form area. Disconnection is still the likely explanation of hemi-alexias, though, particularly when splenial lesions damage inter-hemispheric projections and cause left hemi-alexia. An intra-hemispheric disconnection causing right hemi-alexia is theoretically possible but seems very rare, with only a single report that has been challenged on the grounds of inadequate perimetry. We describe the case of PH, who had a severe reading deficit in her right hemifield. Detailed perimetry showed only a small relative hemi-scotoma along the horizontal meridian, while word reading was impaired over a much larger expanse of her right hemifield, in which object recognition was spared. Reading, lexical decisions, and perceptual discrimination of words were impaired in the right hemifield, and this extended to letters and numbers, with a trend to an effect on the perception of an unfamiliar script, namely Korean. On magnetic resonance imaging she had a large left lateral occipital meningioma with vasogenic edema of occipital white matter tracts. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that the visual word form area was located just anterior to the mass. Her perceptual abnormalities resolved after resection of the tumor. We conclude that right hemi-alexia exists and is most likely due to intra-hemispheric disconnection of occipital input to the visual word form area.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2022.09.015,,Disconnection; Inferior longitudinal fasciculus; Pure alexia; Reading; Words,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Two nonapraxic patients with lesions in the left occipital lobe could imitate pantomimes they could not recognise. Although both patients had a hemianopia, sparing of gesture imitation shows that no visual defect accounts for their inability to recognise pantomimes. Both patients were amnestic and alexic but had no general impairment of cognitive ability to account for a pantomime-recognition disorder. These patients seem to have agnosia for pantomime. From the computed tomograms from these patients, we propose that inferior visual association cortex is critical for gesture comprehension, whereas superior portions of these structures are critical for imitating or performing pantomime to an object presented visually.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.49.4.451,PMC1028777,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Moreover, invasive extramammary Paget's disease (with distant metastasis) highly resistant to treatment. Only for brain metastasis, we may control the tumor by surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRT) for the treatment of intracranial metastases was assessed. An 76-year-old man was diagnosed with extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva at nearby hospital. Surgical resection and sentinel lymph node dissection were then performed, and the patient received chemotherapy because multiple lymph node metastases were suspected. The patient's response to chemotherapy was poor, and he was in the state of Progressive Disease. He complained of dyslexia and was referred to another hospital when he was 81 years old. Plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted, and two brain tumors in the vicinity of the left cerebellar tent were suspected. In our hospital, gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI was performed and showed a tumor in the cerebellum (left posterior temporal lobe) and another tumor under the tent (left cerebellar hemisphere). Significant edema was also noted. Based on these findings, the intracranial lesion was diagnosed as metastatic brain tumor. The pathological diagnosis was brain metastasis from extramammary Paget's disease. Postoperative intracranial residual disease was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. MRI showed that the size of the cerebellar lesions decreased, and no recurrence of cerebral lesions was observed. SRT for extracranial lymph node metastases was performed.

We present the case of a 24-year-old pregnant woman with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that developed after vaccination with the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine (at 37 2/7 wk). TIA occurred 13 d following the coronavirus disease vaccination. At 39 1/7 wk of pregnancy, the patient presented with sudden onset of right eye blurred vision with headache, dizziness with nausea, right-hand weakness, anomia, and alexia. The symptoms lasted 3 h; TIA was diagnosed. Blood test results revealed elevated D-dimer, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.

6244876,Word-form dyslexia.,"Warrington, E K; Shallice, T",Warrington,"In this study we have reported our investigation of two patients with an acquired dyslexia characterized by letter-by-letter reading, whole word reading being apparently impossible. It has been shown that this phenomenon of letter-by-letter reading cannot be accounted for by visual or perceptual factors nor by impairment of visual span of apprehension. The exceptionally slow speed of reading was documented and a clear relationship between word length and reading speed established. Performance on tasks considered to maximize whole word reading which at the same time prevent the possibility of letter-by-letter reading, namely, reading script and reading with tachistoscopic presentation, was impaired. The satisfactory performance of these two patients on tasks of picture interpretation suggests that the two components of the syndrome simultanagnosia, letter-by-letter reading and piecemeal perception of complex scenes, are dissociable. Three alternative explanations of letter-by-letter reading are considered and we conclude that in this type of acquired dyslexia there is damage to the system through which a visual word-form is attained.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.1.99,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

27450929,The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect dyslexia.,"Ptak, Radek; Di Pietro, Marie; Pignat, Jean-Michel",Ptak,"The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed bilateral decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule with the superior and middle temporal cortex. These findings suggest that parieto-temporal connections play a significant role for the deployment of attention within words during reading.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.07.033,,Disconnection; Neglect dyslexia; Parietal lobe; Reading; Spatial neglect; Temporal lobe; Visual attention,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

After rehabilitation of acquired language disorders, functional imaging can detect activity in brain structures that do not mediate language during normal conditions. However, the anatomic correlates of recovery or rehabilitation from acquired reading disorders are largely undescribed. Cerebral SPECT scans were obtained before and after the intervention with Auditory Discrimination in Depth. The first and last activation tasks necessitated that the patient read nonwords during radionuclide uptake. Another (control) scan was acquired during performance of a nonlinguistic task shortly before the end of the ADD program. Before therapy, the right hemisphere was inactive during nonword reading relative to the nonlinguistic task. After treatment, nonword reading increased cerebral blood flow in the posterior right perisylvian cortices homologous to the dominant hemisphere areas engaged by reading. Brain activity also increased in Broca's area of both hemispheres. Dyslexia rehabilitation may facilitate right-hemisphere cortical networks in the reading process and increase engagement of phonologic articulatory motor representations in Broca's area.",{},,"Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology",,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

15246284,Right hemisphere reading mechanisms in a global alexic patient.,"Larsen, Jary; Baynes, Kathleen; Swick, Diane",Larsen,"We investigated the implicit, or covert, reading ability of a global alexic patient (EA) to help determine the contribution of the right hemisphere to reading. Previous studies of alexic patients with left hemisphere damage have suggested that the ability to derive meaning from printed words that cannot be read out loud may reflect right hemisphere reading mechanisms. Other investigators have argued that residual left hemisphere abilities are sufficient to account for implicit reading and moreover do not require the postulation of a right hemisphere system that has no role in normal reading processes. However, few studies have assessed covert reading in patients with lesions as extensive as the one in EA, which affected left medial, inferior temporal-occipital cortex, hippocampus, splenium, and dorsal white matter. EA was presented with lexical decision, semantic categorization, phonemic categorization, and letter matching tasks. Although EA was unable to access phonology and could not overtly name words or letters, she was nevertheless capable of making lexical and semantic decisions at above chance levels, with an advantage for concrete versus abstract words. Her oral and written spelling were relatively intact, suggesting that orthographic knowledge is retained, although inaccessible through the visual modality. Based on her ability to access lexical and semantic information without contacting phonological representations, we propose that EA's implicit reading emerges from, and is supported, by the right hemisphere. Finally, we conclude that her spelling and writing abilities are supported by left hemisphere mechanisms.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Venography through the arteriovenous graft showed occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) and IVR through the internal jugular vein (IJV). It is extremely rare that IVR occurs and causes neurological symptoms. This is because that there is the presence of a valve in the IJV and the communication between the right and left veins through the anterior jugular vein and thyroid vein. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for the left obstructive BCV was performed, but the obstructive lesion was only slightly improved. Hence, shunt ligation was performed.

It is thought to result from the disruption or the disconnection of the visual word form area (VWFA), a region reproducibly located within the left occipito-temporal sulcus, and encoding the abstract identity of strings of visual letters. Alexic patients often retain effective single letter recognition abilities, and develop an effortful letter-by-letter reading strategy which is the basis of most rehabilitation techniques. We study a patient who developed letter-by-letter reading following the surgical removal of left occipito-temporal regions.

Intervention spanned 2 months with sessions 5 days per week. Data collection and analysis involved monitoring sight word decoding, reading speed and decoding errors during MOR, and spelling accuracy of Copy and Recall Treatment words. Follow-up testing occurred at intervention conclusion. Results Sight word mastery for 315 words progressed from 66.35% to 100% over 5 weeks and was maintained thereafter. MOR materials progressed from Grade 1 to Grade 5. Initial reading speed was 31 words per minute with errors on 15% of words. At program completion, reading speed was 47 words per minute with 7% decoding errors despite increased difficulty of reading material. The participant demonstrated initial mastery of 15 spelling lists containing 15 words each and sustained mastery (2 additional consecutive weeks of 100% accuracy) of 8 lists. Follow-up assessment revealed improvements consistent with 3-4 grade levels but persistent impairment relative to premorbid functioning. Conclusion The multicomponent program was effective in promoting substantial improvement, although surface alexia and agraphia persisted after 2 months of treatment. The case provides an example of the type and extent of progress possible given minimal initial recovery but systematic intervention within the context of intensive postacute rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,American journal of speech-language pathology,10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0245,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

VWFA is involved in rapid word recognition and fluent reading. Alexia without agraphia is a disconnection syndrome that occurs when the splenium is also damaged with the occipital lobe on a dominant side. We report a case of a 72-year-old right-handed male who presented with alexia without agraphia accompanied by right homonymous hemianopia resulting from acute infarct of the left occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus that probably occurred on the previous day. During the evaluation, he exhibited marked impairment in the ability to read with the vision being grossly normal. Magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) revealed an acute infarct of the left occipital lobe, the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamus. A computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarct without any evidence of hemorrhagic conversion. Infarction of the occipital lobe on the dominant side (left) in a right-handed individual may cause a disruption in the visual word form area and is manifested by an inability to read with no abnormalities in visual acuity.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.1304,PMC5493472,agraphia; alexia; cerebral ischemia; disconnection syndrome; hemianopia; occipital lobe; posterior cerebral artery; stroke; visual changes; visual word form area,Case Reports,United States,eng

Writing was characterized by sensitivity to lexical-semantic variables (i.e., word frequency, imageability, and part of speech), semantic errors in writing to dictation and written naming, total inability to use the nonlexical phonological spelling route, and agrammatism in spontaneous writing. The reliance on a lexical-semantic strategy in spelling, semantic errors, and impaired phonology and syntax were all highly consistent with the general characteristics of right hemisphere language, as revealed by studies of split-brain patients and adults with dominant hemispherectomy. In addition, this pattern of writing closely resembled the syndrome of deep agraphia.

We assessed the reading and writing abilities of three patients using kanji (Japanese morphograms) and kana (Japanese syllabograms). Patient 1 showed kana alexia and kanji agraphia following a hemorrhage in the left angular gyrus and the adjacent lateral occipital gyri. Patient 2 presented with minimal pure agraphia for both kanji and kana after an infarction in the left angular gyrus involving part of the supramarginal gyrus. Patient 3 also showed moderate pure agraphia for both kanji and kana after an infarction in the left supramarginal and postcentral gyri. All three patients made transposition errors (changing of sequential order of kana characters) in reading. Patient 1 showed letter-by-letter reading and a word-length effect and made substitution errors (changing hiragana [one form of kana] characters in a word to katakana [another form of kana] characters and vice versa) in writing. Alexia occurs as ""angular"" alexia only when the lesion involves the adjacent lateral occipital gyri. Transposition errors suggest disrupted sequential phonological processing from the angular and lateral occipital gyri to the supramarginal gyrus.

The present article reports 2 rare cases of pial AVF that underwent spontaneous cure after diagnostic cerebral angiogram. A 73-year-old man presented with generalized seizure and reported severe but intermittent headache in the right temporo-occipital area. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hyperperfusion in that area. The main finding of a cerebral angiogram was an arteriovenous shunt at the cortical surface of the right temporal area. Soon after this diagnostic angiogram, the symptoms vanished. A further cerebral angiogram showed the disappearance of this pial AVF, and a SPECT study showed resolution of the hyperperfusion of the affected area. A 69-year-old man, with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage on the left parietal area 3 years earlier, presented with speech disturbance and headache on his left side. SPECT showed hyperperfusion in the left temporoparietal area. A cerebral angiogram showed an arteriovenous shunt at the surface of the left parietal area. During the same cerebral angiogram session, the pial AVF disappeared after the third injection of a contrast medium with magnification. Two days after the cerebral angiogram, the patient's headache disappeared and speech disturbance gradually improved. SPECT also showed disappearance of the hyperperfusion. It is possible that pial AVF is a cause of headache and neurologic symptoms in association with focal hyperperfusion. Diagnostic cerebral angiography should be performed to make a definite diagnosis; after this, pial AVF sometimes disappears.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.04.155,,Cerebral angiogram; Cerebral blood flow; Headache; Pial arteriovenous fistula; Spontaneous resolution,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
37818220,"Case report: Neural timing deficits prevalent in developmental disorders, aging, and concussions remediated rapidly by movement discrimination exercises.","Lawton, Teri; Shelley-Tremblay, John; Huang, Ming-Xiong",Lawton,"The substantial evidence that neural timing deficits are prevalent in developmental disorders, aging, and concussions resulting from a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is presented. When these timing deficits are remediated using low-level movement-discrimination training, then high-level cognitive skills, including reading, attention, processing speed, problem solving, and working memory improve rapidly and effectively. In addition to the substantial evidence published previously, new evidence based on a neural correlate, MagnetoEncephalography physiological recordings, on an adult dyslexic, and neuropsychological tests on this dyslexic subject and an older adult were measured before and after 8-weeks of contrast sensitivity-based left-right movement-discrimination exercises were completed. The neuropsychological tests found large improvements in reading, selective and sustained attention, processing speed, working memory, and problem-solving skills, never before found after such a short period of training. Moreover, these improvements were found 4â€‰years later for older adult. Substantial MEG signal increases in visual Motion, Attention, and Memory/Executive Control Networks were observed following training on contrast sensitivity-based left-right movement-discrimination. Improving the function of magnocells using figure/ground movement-discrimination at both low and high levels in dorsal stream: (1) improved both feedforward and feedback pathways to modulate attention by enhancing coupled theta/gamma and alpha/gamma oscillations, (2) is adaptive, and (3) incorporated cycles of feedback and reward at multiple levels. What emerges from multiple studies is the essential role of timing deficits in the dorsal stream that are prevalent in developmental disorders like dyslexia, in aging, and following a TBI. Training visual dorsal stream function at low levels significantly improved high-level cognitive functions, including processing speed, selective and sustained attention, both auditory and visual working memory, problem solving, and reading fluency. A paradigm shift for treating cognitive impairments in developmental disorders, aging, and concussions is crucial. Remediating the neural timing deficits of low-level dorsal pathways, thereby improving both feedforward and feedback pathways, before cognitive exercises to improve specific cognitive skills provides the most rapid and effective methods to improve cognitive skills. Moreover, this adaptive training with substantial feedback shows cognitive transfer to tasks not trained on, significantly improving a person's quality of life rapidly and effectively.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.898781,PMC10560731,cognitive remediation; cortical plasticity; magnocellular deficits; perceptual learning; reading/attention/memory/executive control networks; timing deficits,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The patient can describe or demonstrate the use of objects she cannot name and to sort them into their appropriate categories, indicating adequate non-verbal recognition. The impairment is specific to visual naming, as recognition through modalities different from vision is adequate (e.g. by touching the object, hearing its sound or being provided with verbal definition of it). This study and follow-up testing illustrated the evolution of the deficit, from a visual agnosic impairment to the co-occurrence of partial deficit of visual naming of objects and letters (optic aphasia and alexia).

Aphasia treatment is particularly well suited for telerehab because of the verbal and visual nature of speech-language therapy, but scientific research investigating aphasia telerehab is in its infancy. No studies to date have evaluated whether treatment of acquired reading disorders by a live clinician can be feasibly, effectively, or efficiently conducted via telerehab. Here we address this gap in the literature by reporting our success remotely remediating the reading deficits of two participants with phonological alexia. We adapted for the telerehab setting a previously validated treatment for phonological alexia (Friedman, Sample, & Lott, 2002 ), which uses a paired-associate design to train reading of problematic words. Both telerehab participants significantly improved their reading of trained words in similar time frames as previous participants (Friedman et al., 2002 ; Kurland et al., 2008 ; Lott, Sample, Oliver, Lacey, & Friedman, 2008 ); furthermore, both participants reported high satisfaction with the telerehab setting.

During the evaluation, he exhibited a marked deficit in his ability to read, with vision grossly intact. His ability to write single words and short phrases from dictation was intact, but he was later unable to read them. This case demonstrates the complexity of the organization of language in the human brain. Although a large majority of individuals exhibit language dominance in their left hemispheres, it remains possible that some right-handed individuals may show atypical organization of language. This highlights the need for clinicians to consider atypical cortical organization when observed deficits may not necessarily match expected lesions within the cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Applied neuropsychology.

The major characteristic is an inability to localise objects in space, another is simultanagnosia frequently resulting in reading difficulties. We present RN, a 37 year old woman whose major problem with reading was her inability to recognise individual letters correctly in either lower or upper case. We noted, however, that she was better if the letters were shown in red type. The aims were to determine if RN could relearn letters of the alphabet, investigate whether colour affected her ability to learn, and to explore more specifically whether the red type also helped her to read words. Using a single case experimental ABA design, we first determined that the optimal font for RN was size 16. In the baseline (A) phase, we assessed her ability to read all lower and upper case letters of the alphabet in black ink. In the intervention (B) phase we used font size 16 in red ink and an errorless learning approach to teaching the letters. Sessions ran 5 times per week (20 minutes per session). The intervention was then applied to picture recognition and word reading with four sets of 10 words and corresponding pictures.

In 2 patients it was possible to compare visual and verbal modalities and the same pattern of dissociation was observed in both. For 1 patient, comprehension of abstract words was significantly superior to comprehension of concrete words.

In this paper, we report the first evidence of right hyperactivation in an adult case of developmental deep dyslexia. Hyperactivation was observed in the right inferior frontal cortex during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the oral reading of imageable content words and nonwords to which imageable lexical responses were frequently made. No evidence of right hyperactivation was observed in the oral reading of function words, nor during the naming of imageable words in response to pictured objects. The results reveal strategic and selective use of right-hemisphere functions for particular types of written stimuli. We propose that children with developmental deep dyslexia compensate for their lack of phonological skills by accessing right-hemisphere imageable associations that provide a mnemonic for linking written forms to spoken names.",{},,Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006),10.1080/17470210701425845,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

His MRI revealed an area of infarct with microhemorrhages at the left occipitotemporal region. The patient was blinded to each therapy and underwent seven consecutive sessions of sham tDCS followed by seven consecutive sessions of real tDCS, coupled with 1-hour MOR therapy during each session. Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was performed at baseline, before sham and real-tDCS, and 6 weeks after completing tDCS therapy. The patient showed improvement using both sham and real-tDCS with better reading comprehension, average reading time, and word per minute after real-tDCS.

The authors report a case of pure agraphia following left thalamic hemorrhage. The patient showed impairment in the writing of both kanji and kana. The most frequent error in the writing of kanji was substitution (46%) followed by no reaction (23%) and partial omission or addition of characters (21%). The copying of kanji by hand was normal. Even when the patient was unable to write a kanji character, he understood the meaning and correctly recited the other readings. He complained that he could not recall the graphic image of the kanji. When we cued the patient by writing a part of a kanji he initially failed to recall, he correctly completed the character. The kanji and kana he was unable to write were inconsistent over time: in some cases he was unable to write words he had successfully written a week before, and vice versa. These findings suggested that the patient's pure agraphia resulted from combined impairments in recalling and selecting letters. While the thalamic lesion might have influenced the manifestation of pure agraphia, the dysfunction seemed to originate from the secondary negative effect of the lesion on the function of the left cerebral cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

The patient had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage causing damage to the left occipital cortex and underlying white matter. NT's text reading was slow and prone to error, but recognition of single letters was preserved. Single word reading was accurate, but slower than normal. On perimetric testing NT initially showed an upper right quadrantanopia, but by attending covertly to this quadrant he could achieve luminance detection except in a small scotoma above the reading line. A whole report experiment showed that letter perception was severely compromised in the quadrant, consistent with cerebral amblyopia. On follow-up testing one and a half year post stroke, a clear spontaneous recovery had occurred, reflected in improved text reading with close to normal eye movements. Still, subtle reading difficulties and oculo-motor abnormalities remained. Overall, the study shows how amblyopia in one quadrant can lead to a characteristic form of alexia.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.007,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

To document the clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological features of six cases of cognitive presentation of multiple sclerosis, to review the relevant literature, and to propose a possible cortical basis for this clinical presentation. Six patients (five women; age range 38 to 60 years) presented to the memory and cognitive disorders clinic in Cambridge with an initially undiagnosed cognitive/neuropsychiatric syndrome. All underwent neuropsychological evaluation, brain imaging, and ancillary investigations to establish a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The six cases all had a progressive dementia syndrome with prominent amnesia, often accompanied by classic cortical features including dysphasia, dysgraphia, or dyslexia. Mood disturbance was ubiquitous and in three patients there was a long history of preceding severe depression. All six developed characteristic physical signs on follow up, with marked disabilities. A review of 17 previously reported cases highlighted the prominence of memory impairment and depression in the early stages. On clinical, pathological, and radiological grounds, the neuropsychiatric presentation of multiple sclerosis may represent a clinicopathological entity of ""cortical multiple sclerosis.""

Evidence supporting the role of this area in reading comes from neuroimaging studies of normal subjects, case-controlled lesion studies, and studies of patients with surgical resection of the VWFA for tumors or epilepsy. Based on these prior reports, a small discrete lesion to the VWFA would be expected to cause alexia in a literate person without prior brain process, but such a case has not previously been reported to our knowledge. Here, we report the case of a previously-healthy 63-year-old man with the acute onset of alexia without other significant impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a small ischemic stroke localized to the inferior left occipitotemporal cortex, corresponding to the approximate location of the putative VWFA. Characteristic of pure alexia, testing in the weeks following the stroke revealed a letter-by-letter reading strategy and a word length effect on single word reading. Formal visual field testing was normal. There was no color anomia, or object or face recognition deficits, although a mild agraphia may have been present. This case of acute-onset alexia in a previously normal individual due to a small stroke restricted to the VWFA and sparing occipital cortex and white matter pathways supports the conclusion that the VWFA is crucial for reading.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770873,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the early days of his illness, he demonstrated the inability to read aloud on either Kana (Japanese syllabograms) or Kanji (Japanese morphograms). In contrast, he could semantically categorize Kanji-words such as animals or non-animals. Subsequently, he gradually regained the ability of reading aloud Kanji as well as Kana. At that time, we further investigated the relation between his reading ability and the attributes of 881 Kanji characters including hieroglyphicity, concreteness, and familiarity. We found that he could more readily read Kanjis with higher hieroglyphicity, concreteness, and familiarity. The reading times for Kanji-words were significantly shorter than those of corresponding Kana-words. Moreover, he showed some difficulty to read Kana-words and Kana combinations without meaning when asked to perform repetitive opposing movements with his thumb and little finger inhibiting kinesthetic reading. The effect was not observed when he read Kanji-words. These results lead us to suggest the following: (1) the two components of reading, reading aloud and comprehension abilities, are dissociable in a pure alexic, especially in Kanji reading; and (2) recovery mechanisms underlying Kanji and Kana reading were different in our case. Namely, restitution of the direct connection through the residual splenium fibers between the visual word form processing area in the right hemisphere and the left angular gyrus was attributed to Kanji reading, and utilization of kinesthetic reading played an important role in Kana reading.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Here, we address this issue through the single-case longitudinal study of a neuroscientist who experienced pure alexia and participated in 17 behavioral, 9 anatomical, and 9 fMRI assessment sessions over a period of two years. The origin of the impairment was assigned to a small left fusiform lesion, accompanied by a loss of VWFA responsivity and by the degeneracy of the associated white matter pathways. fMRI experiments allowed us to image longitudinally the visual perception of words, as compared to other classes of stimuli, as well as the mechanisms of letter-by-letter reading. The progressive improvement of reading was not associated with the re-emergence of a new area selective to words, but with increasing responses in spared occipital cortex posterior to the lesion and in contralateral right occipital cortex. Those regions showed a non-specific increase of activations over time and an increase in functional correlation with distant language areas. Those results confirm the existence of an alternative occipital route for reading, bypassing the VWFA, but they also point to its key limitation: the patient remained a slow letter-by-letter reader, thus supporting the critical importance of the VWFA for the efficient parallel recognition of written words.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.07.009,,Alexia; Language; Reading; Vision; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Reading accuracy was relatively good at all stages and reading latency showed a remarkable decrease over time but did not reach normal reading rates. The inability to use higher-order orthographic knowledge, as manifest in the absence of a word superiority effect, was still noted at one year postonset.

The brain lesion affected the classical language areas, but spared a subset of the left inferior parietal lobule that was active during calculation tasks, as demonstrated with functional MRI.

The component letters of a string benefit when they form a familiar global object, rather than requiring representation as multiple separate objects.

We assessed the reading and writing abilities of two patients with this lesion using kanji (Japanese morphograms) and kana (Japanese syllabograms). Patient 1 first presented with pure alexia more impaired for kana after an infarction in the left middle and inferior occipital gyri and right basal occipital cortex, and after a second infarction in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus adjoining the first lesion he showed alexia with agraphia for kanji and worsened alexia for kana; kanji alexia recovered over the following six to 10 months. Patient 2 presented with alexia with agraphia for kanji following a hemorrhage in the left posterior middle and inferior temporal gyri, which resolved to agraphia for kanji at two months after onset. Kana nonword reading was also slightly impaired, but became normal by six months post-onset. In both patients, kanji agraphia was mostly due to impaired character recall. The present patients demonstrate that damage to the left posterior middle temporal gyrus alone can cause agraphia for kanji. If the adjacent mid fusiform/inferior temporal gyri (Area 37) are spared, the kanji alexia is transient.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2008/393912,PMC5452449,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The effect of strategy.,"Coslett, H B; Saffran, E M; Greenbaum, S; Schwartz, H",Coslett,"A number of investigators have demonstrated that patients with pure alexia comprehend briefly presented words which they are unable to explicitly identify. We suggested previously that these patients may read by means of two distinct procedures: a laborious letter-by-letter method and a 'whole-word' procedure which, at least initially, does not support explicit word identification. We report a test of this proposal in a patient with pure alexia. We reasoned that if the patient had access to two distinct and incompatible procedures, he might be induced to switch from one to the other by changing task demands. We found that when instructed to name words, the patient employed a letter-by-letter strategy; in contrast, when instructed to make lexical decision or semantic judgements about rapidly presented words, he appeared to use a 'whole-word' strategy. These data support the hypothesis that two distinct procedures are available to this patient. We argue, further, that is necessary to suppress use of the letter-by-letter strategy to demonstrate whole word reading capability in pure alexics, and that failure to do so may account for negative findings in other cases reported in the literature.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/116.1.21,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Functional properties of the Visual Word Form Area.,"Cohen, Laurent; LehÃ©ricy, StÃ©phane; Chochon, Florence; Lemer, Cathy; Rivaud, Sophie; Dehaene, Stanislas",Cohen,"The first steps in the process of reading a printed word belong to the domain of visual object perception. They culminate in a representation of letter strings as an ordered set of abstract letter identities, a representation known as the Visual Word Form (VWF). Brain lesions in patients with pure alexia and functional imaging data suggest that the VWF is subtended by a restricted patch of left-hemispheric fusiform cortex, which is reproducibly activated during reading. In order to determine whether the operation of this Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) depends exclusively on the visual features of stimuli, or is influenced by language-dependent parameters, brain activations induced by words, consonant strings and chequerboards were compared in normal subjects using functional MRI (fMRI). Stimuli were presented in the left or right visual hemifield. The VWFA was identified in both a blocked-design experiment and an event-related experiment as a left-hemispheric inferotemporal area showing a stronger activation to alphabetic strings than to chequerboards, and invariant for the spatial location of stimuli. In both experiments, stronger activations of the VWFA to words than to strings of consonants were observed. Considering that the VWFA is equally activated by real words and by readable pseudowords, this result demonstrates that the VWFA is initially plastic and becomes attuned to the orthographic regularities that constrain letter combination during the acquisition of literacy. Additionally, the use of split-field stimulation shed some light on the cerebral bases of the classical right visual field (RVF) advantage in reading. A left occipital extrastriate area was found to be activated by RVF letter strings more than by chequerboards, while no symmetrical region was observed in the right hemisphere. Moreover, activations in the precuneus and the left thalamus were observed when subjects were reading RVF versus left visual field (LVF) words, and are likely to reflect the attentional component of the RVF advantage.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awf094,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Although there are several features of his performance that are suggestive in this regard; we argue that, when these issues are addressed in the context of a sufficiently elaborated theory of lexical processing, a morphological processing deficit cannot be demonstrated. We also survey a number of recent reports that purport to provide evidence for a morphological processing deficit and argue that, in most cases, they fail to support such claims for similar reasons. An important moral to be drawn from a critique of these studies is that in order to make valid inferences concerning the role of morphology in organizing the lexicon, we must consider these errors in the context of theories of the lexicon that take seriously the effects of converging lexical factors in processing.",{},,Brain and language,10.1016/0093-934x(87)90129-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng

(2) The symbols of staff music notation are more visually distinctive than the symbols of phonetic language writing systems. (3) In staff music notation, pitch is represented ordinally, and other symbols are also distinguishable by their relative positions and sizes. (4) Music notation can be usefully read by interpreting it acoustically, kinaesthetically or in terms of formal musical concepts; in contrast to written language, it need not be interpreted referentially or in terms of auditory-verbal images.

Transcortical alexia produces errors in both reading and writing while copying is preserved. The patient had a severe alexia and was unable to read letters, words or sentences. Language examination showed mild aphasia with reduced fluency, intermittent paraphasia but a good comprehension and a normal repetition. Spontaneously and from dictation, writing was impaired by an agraphic jargon, but copying was excellent even though the patient was unable to read his own written production. There was no visual agnosia nor hemianopia. CT scan and MRI of the brain showed that there was a single right temporo-occipital hemorrhage but no lesion in the left hemisphere. Following surgical evacuation of the hematoma, the patient improved. One month after onset, his language was quite intact and reading was possible. We hypothesize that this particular syndrome was the result of a double disconnection: alexia would result from a disconnection of the right angular gyrus and the occipital associative areas by a subangular lesion; agraphia would result from a disconnection of the right angular gyrus and the semantic store, probably located in the right hemisphere.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)90108-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It remains however unclear whether the VA span deficit and the deficits in temporal and spatial attention shifting also reported in dyslexic children reflect a unitary spatio-temporal deficit of attention - probably linked to general posterior parietal dysfunction- or the dysfunction of distinct attentional systems that relate to different neural substrates. We explored this issue by testing an adult patient, IG, with a specific damage of the bilateral superior parietal lobules after stroke, on tasks assessing the VA span as well as temporal and spatial attention shifting. IG demonstrated a very severe VA span deficit, but preserved temporal attention shifting. Exogenous spatial orientation shifting was spared but her performance was impaired in endogenous attention. The overall findings show that distinct sub-systems of visual attention can be dissociated within the parietal lobe, suggesting that different attentional systems associated with specific neural networks can be selectively impaired in developmental dyslexia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.001,,Brain damage; Developmental dyslexia; Endogenous and exogenous spatial attention; Superior parietal lobule; Visual attention; Visual attention span,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

An online visual field test (an 'app') was developed as part of a free to use web based therapy site for patients with hemianopic alexia, called Read-Right (http://www.readright.ucl.ac.uk). This study is an attempt to validate this test by comparing with a clinical 'gold standard'-the Humphrey automated visual field analyser. 22 patients had their visual fields assessed with both techniques on the same day. The criterion validity of the Read-Right was examined by comparing it with Humphrey 10-2 and 24-2 perimetry using the following measures: (1) sensitivity and specificity; (2) Îº statistics; and (3) intraclass correlation. Read-Right demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, particularly for the undamaged field. In the damaged field, Îº values were highly significant, especially for points along the horizontal meridian. The intraclass correlation score for the damaged field indicated excellent correlation between the two tests. Read-Right perimetry performed well on all measures. It had a tendency to under call damaged points offset from the horizontal meridian, and this and other aspects of the test will be revamped. Read-Right is not designed to replace standardised visual perimetry; it does, however, offer a quick and easy assessment that can be used to screen patients.

A similar distribution of errors was demonstrated in writing (very inaccurate performance on initial letters). This pattern of performance suggests damage to an abstract letter string representation defined by spatial coordinates, rather than to an ordering mechanism.

14615297,Visual word recognition in the left and right hemispheres: anatomical and functional correlates of peripheral alexias.,"Cohen, L; Martinaud, O; Lemer, C; LehÃ©ricy, S; Samson, Y; Obadia, M; Slachevsky, A; Dehaene, S",Cohen,"According to a simple anatomical and functional model of word reading, letters displayed in one hemifield are first analysed through a cascade of contralateral retinotopic areas, which compute increasingly abstract representations. Eventually, an invariant representation of letter identities is created in the visual word form area (VWFA), reproducibly located within the left occipito-temporal sulcus. The VWFA then projects to structures involved in phonological or lexico-semantic processing. This model yields detailed predictions on the reading impairments that may follow left occipitotemporal lesions. Those predictions were confronted to behavioural, anatomical and functional MRI data gathered in normals and in patients suffering from left posterior cerebral artery infarcts. In normal subjects, alphabetic stimuli activated both the VWFA and the right-hemispheric symmetrical region (R-VWFA) relative to fixation, but only the VWFA showed a preference for alphabetic strings over simple chequerboards. The comparison of normalized brain lesions with reading-induced activations showed that the critical lesion site for the classical syndrome of pure alexia can be tightly localized to the VWFA. Reading impairments resulting from deafferentation of an intact VWFA from right- or left-hemispheric input were dissected using the same methods, shedding light on the connectivity of the VWFA.

At initial testing, RB exhibited acquired alexia characterized by letter-by-letter (LBL) reading, mild anomic aphasia, and acquired agraphia. Repeated measures of reading accuracy and rate were collected for single words and text over the course of one year, along with probes of naming and spelling abilities. Improvements associated with natural recovery (i.e., without treatment) were documented up to the fourth month post onset, when text reading appeared to be relatively stable. Multiple oral reading (MOR) treatment was initiated at 22 weeks post-stroke, and additional improvements in reading rate and accuracy for text were documented that were greater than those expected on the basis of spontaneous recovery alone. Over the course of one year, reading reaction times for single words improved, and the word-length effect that is the hallmark of LBL reading diminished. RB's response to treatment supports the therapeutic value of MOR treatment to in LBL readers. His residual impairment of reading and spelling one-year post stroke raised the question as to whether further progress was impeded by degraded orthographic knowledge.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2005/413962,PMC5478842,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng
21400959,[Associative visual agnosia. The less visible consequences of a cerebral infarction].,"Diesfeldt, H F A",Diesfeldt,"After a cerebral infarction, some patients acutely demonstrate contralateral hemiplegia, or aphasia. Those are the obvious symptoms of a cerebral infarction. However, less visible but burdensome consequences may go unnoticed without closer investigation. The importance of a thorough clinical examination is exemplified by a single case study of a 72-year-old, right-handed male. Two years before he had suffered from an ischemic stroke in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery, with right homonymous hemianopia and global alexia (i.e., impairment in letter recognition and profound impairment of reading) without agraphia. Naming was impaired on visual presentation (20%-39% correct), but improved significantly after tactile presentation (87% correct) or verbal definition (89%). Pre-semantic visual processing was normal (correct matching of different views of the same object), as was his access to structural knowledge from vision (he reliably distinguished real objects from non-objects). On a colour decision task he reliably indicated which of two items was coloured correctly. Though he was unable to mime how visually presented objects were used, he more reliably matched pictures of objects with pictures of a mime artist gesturing the use of the object. He obtained normal scores on word definition (WAIS-III), synonym judgment and word-picture matching tasks with perceptual and semantic distractors. He however failed when he had to match physically dissimilar specimens of the same object or when he had to decide which two of five objects were related associatively (Pyramids and Palm Trees Test). The patient thus showed a striking contrast in his intact ability to access knowledge of object shape or colour from vision and impaired functional and associative knowledge. As a result, he could not access a complete semantic representation, required for activating phonological representations to name visually presented objects. The pattern of impairments and preserved abilities is considered to be a specific difficulty to access a full semantic representation from an intact structural representation of visually presented objects, i.e., a form of visual object agnosia.",{},,Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,dut

The patient, AA, has a large infarct involving the left posterior cerebral artery. The most striking feature is a severe impairment in recognizing single visually presented letters that precludes explicit or implicit access to reading, even in a letter-by-letter fashion. AA can, however, differentiate letters from similar nonsense characters and digits, and he is also able to identify alphanumeric signs when the visual channel is bypassed (through somesthesic or kinesthesic presentation). Spelling tasks are also well performed. Since there is a breakdown in mapping a visually presented letter to its abstract graphemic representation, we propose the term ""visuographemic alexia"" for this kind of reading disorder. The pattern of deficits is interpreted following theoretical models previously developed in cognitive neuropsychology. An alexia for arabic numerals with preserved comprehension lends additional support for the crucial processing of different notational systems (e.g., phonographic vs logographic). More general perceptive disorders do not seem to account for these patterns; they are material-specific.

11716831,Deep dyslexia in the two languages of an Arabic/French bilingual patient.,"BÃ©land, R; Mimouni, Z",BÃ©land,"We present a single case study of an Arabic/French bilingual patient, ZT, who, at the age of 32, suffered a cerebral vascular accident that resulted in a massive infarct in the left peri-sylvian region. ZT's reading displays the characteristics of the deep dyslexia syndrome in both languages, that is, production of semantic, visual, and morphological errors, and concreteness effect in reading aloud and impossibility of reading nonwords. In the first part of this paper, using a three-route model of reading, we account for the patient's performance by positing functional lesions, which affect the non-lexical, the semantic lexical and the non-semantic lexical routes of reading. Phonological priming observed in a cross-language visual lexical decision task indicates that implicit assembled phonological recoding is possible. The above lesions and implicit nonword reading characterize the output form of deep dyslexia. However, error distribution reveals dissociations across languages (e.g. the semantic error rate is higher in French whereas translations are more frequent in the Arabic testing) that cannot be accounted for within a three-route model. In the second part, extensions to Plaut and Shallice's connectionist model (Cognitive Neuropsychology, 10 (5) (1993) 377) are proposed to account for the translinguistic errors observed. ZT's error distribution is compared to that obtained by Plaut and Shallice after lesions had been applied at different locations through the 40-60 network. The overall syndrome of deep dyslexia found in both languages is explained as resulting from lesions along the direct (O-->I) and output (S-->Ip, Ip-->P) pathways of reading. Lesions along the output pathway mostly affecting S-->Ip connections in French and Ip-->P connections in Arabic account for discrepancies in ZT's error pattern across tasks and languages. This case study demonstrates the superiority of a connectionist approach for predicting the error pattern in deep dyslexia.",{},,Cognition,10.1016/s0010-0277(01)00148-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

These disorders result in phonological errors typified by adding, omitting, shifting, or repeating phonemes in words during reading or graphemes when spelling. In developmental dyslexia, similar phonological errors are believed to result from deficient phonological awareness, an oral language skill that manifests itself in the ability to notice, think about, or manipulate the individual sounds in words. The Auditory Discrimination in Depth (ADD) program has been reported to train phonological awareness in developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia. We used a multiple-probe design to evaluate the ADD program's effectiveness with a patient with a mild phonological alexia and mixed agraphia following a left hemisphere infarction.

These observations converge on previous reports of an effect of AoA on reading and spelling of alphabetic scripts and in the reading of Japanese Kanji, a non-alphabetic script. An effect of AoA is also the expected outcome of the arbitrary mapping hypothesis which assumes that the locus of the AoA effect resides in the connection between levels of representations in the lexical processing system. We consider alternative interpretations of the AoA effect being located at the representations themselves, including phonological output and the semantic system. We propose that future studies of dyslexic individuals who rely primarily on the semantic reading route for reading in Chinese may reveal effects of semantic variables, including those associated with the semantic radical in phonetic compound characters.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802270594,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The current study directly compared processing of letters and digits in a letter-by-letter reader, G.M., using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task and a speeded matching task. Comparisons were made to a group of six brain-damaged individuals without reading deficits. In the RSVP task, G.M. had increased difficulty reporting the target identities when they were letters, as compared with digits. Although this general pattern was also evident in the control group, the magnitude of the letter-digit accuracy difference was greater in G.M. Similarly, in the matching task, G.M. was slower to match letters than digits, relative to the control group, although his response times to both item types were increased. These data suggest that letter-by-letter reading, at least in this case, results from a visuoperceptual encoding deficit that particularly affects letters, but also extends to processing of digits to a lesser extent.

This paper describes a single case who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury resulting in a lesion of the posterior body of the corpus callosum. Among the classical symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection, left hand anomia, left upper limb ideomotor dyspraxia, left visual field dyslexia and dysnomia, and left ear suppression in a dichotic listening task were observed shortly after the injury but recovered completely or almost completely with the passage of time. The only symptom of interhemispheric disconnection which was found to persist more than 4 years after the injury was an abnormal prolongation of the crossed-uncrossed difference in a simple visuomotor reaction time task. This prolongation was comparable with that observed in subjects with complete callosal lesions or agenesis. The results suggest that the posterior body of the corpus callosum may be an obligatory interhemispheric communication channel for mediating fast visuo-motor responses. The transient nature of other symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection suggests a relatively wide dispersion of fibers with different functions through the callosal body, such that parts of them can survive a restricted lesion and allow functional recovery of hemispheric interactions. An assessment of the evolution in time of symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection following restricted callosal lesions may reveal fine and coarse features of the anatomo-functional topography of the corpus callosum.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00203-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In addition, he had a milder deficit in accessing lexical representations for output from all input modalities. RMI's execution of various language tasks provided considerable insight into the mechanisms that underlie oral reading. His performance indicated that both semantic access and orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms were partially intact. When information from these two impoverished systems was coupled (the picture of an object presented with its written name), his ability to read/name improved significantly, consistent with the hypothesis that partially accessed semantic information from vision can combine with partially accessed sublexical orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms to access phonological representations for output. Furthermore, his written word and picture recognition improved to normal at a time when magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated reperfusion of the splenium.

Some cases of pure alexia may be a perceptual word-form agnosia, with loss of internal representations of letters and words, while the angular gyral syndrome of alexia with agraphia is a linguistic deep dyslexia.

These are (1) localization principle: elementary functions are related to specific cortical areas; (2) Diaschisis: functions located at a distance from an acute lesion may be affected by that lesion. The chronicity effect states that as a nonprogressive lesion becomes chronic, diaschisis tends to recede. In an illustrative detailed case study, a man with encephalitis concentrated in the left temporoparietal area was tested five times over a 6-year period. In the first testing at 5 weeks many of his abilities were impaired. In subsequent months, all abilities except reading returned to the normal range.

Gerstmann's syndrome is a combination of disorientation for left and right, finger agnosia, and profound agraphia, alexia, and acalculia. It is due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus, situated at the confluence of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report on a patient who suffered from severe underdiagnosed eclampsia and who developed bilateral extensive medial temporal, parietal, and calcarine ischemic infarctions during an eclamptic fit. In addition, ischemia destroyed the left angular gyrus. The combination of these lesions led to Gerstmann's syndrome with additional cortical agnosia and cortical diplopia. For the first few months following the ischemic insult, the patient had been cortically blind. Thereafter, the patient slowly regained a visual acuity of 0.1 in both eyes. She then experienced monocular and binocular diplopia. Her ocular motility was normal; there was no phoria or tropia. Monocular and binocular diplopia slowly became less severe over the following year. Now, 2 years after the incident, the patient has a visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes and no double vision. However, the handicapping symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome, which make leading a normal life impossible, have persisted--the patient still cannot cope alone, mainly due to the severe disorientation for left and right. The picture of cortical agnosia, cortical diplopia, and Gerstmann's syndrome is a very rare combination. Visual recovery and rehabilitation in cortical blindness are severely affected and made difficult by the symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome. In our case the reason for such a dramatic clinical picture was eclampsia, whose prodomes had not been diagnosed in time.",{},,German journal of ophthalmology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

While the patient could not consistently demonstrate awareness of knowledge prior to stimulus matching ('Do you know what this is?'), she was able to reliably demonstrate awareness of knowledge for response accuracy ('Are you sure?') assessed after stimulus matching. Further, the extent of the patient's metaknowledge corresponded to her degree of preserved knowledge.

A 74-year-old right-handed man presented with a prominent reading impairment in Hangul with agraphia of both Hangul and Hanja after a left posterior occipital- parietal lesion. He could not recognize single syllable words and nonwords in Hangul, and visual errors were predominant in both Hanja reading and the Korean Boston Naming Test. In addition, he had difficulties in visuoperceptual tests including Judgment of Line Orientation, Hierarchical Navon figures, and complex picture scanning. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Hangul reading impairment results from a general visual perceptual deficit. However, this assumption cannot explain why performance on visually complex Hanja was better than performance on visually simple Hanja in our patient. In addition, the patient did not demonstrate higher accuracy on Hanja characters with fewer strokes than on words with more strokes. Thus, we speculate that the left posterior occipital area may be specialized for Hangul letter identification in this patient.

Neuroradiological studies showed a relatively confined DAVF lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient did not have a history of trauma and did not complain of headache or tinnitus. Amnesia and alexia dramatically improved upon treatment of the DAVF, and this was associated with attenuation of an abnormal MRI signal in the left temporal lobe. The results suggest that gradually impaired cerebral circulation due to focal venous hypertensive encephalopathy localized to the left temporal lobe and resulting from a DAVF could be involved in slowly progressive amnesia and alexia. The case also shows that an intracranial DAVF may present as a variety of neurological symptoms, depending on its localization, size and clinical stage.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.2169/internalmedicine.46.0262,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

Homonymous hemianopia (HH) has rarely been described in this syndrome. We report on six patients (four females, two males, aged 63 to 80) referred for visual disorder which led to demonstration of HH using perimetry testing. These patients were followed for 1 to 5 years after discovery of HH. Brain imaging with MRI or CT scan was obtained in the six cases and a SPECT scan was performed in four cases. HH was left-sided in four cases and right-sided in two cases. Associated symptoms related to higher visual dysfunction were simultagnosia, alone or as part of a full Balint's syndrome, alexia, constructional apraxia, dressing apraxia, visual form agnosia, prosopagnosia and hemispatial neglect. These symptoms were mild at onset but invariably worsened with disease progression. Dementia eventually developed in all cases. The clinical diagnosis was probable Alzheimer's disease in five cases and corticobasal degeneration in one case. Radiology showed posterior cortex atrophy in all cases as well as reduced cerebral blood flow in the same region, with an asymmetrical pattern compatible with the side of HH. Elementary cortical lesions in PCA can develop mainly in the associative visual areas and even in the primary visual area, resulting in HH. HH has rarely been documented in PCA, but its prevalence would probably be higher if systematic search was conducted. Apparently isolated HH of insidious onset should suggest PCA and lead to neuropsychological testing and search for discrete atrophic changes of the posterior cortex on MRI as well as for metabolic alterations with SPECT or PET.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2008.10.010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

In contrast to previously reported cases of this syndrome arising from other etiologies, he was unable to read single letters or numbers. Neuropsychological studies at 42 and 126 days after operation also disclosed an inability to associate auditory or tactile stimuli with visually perceived material, whereas speech and verbal comprehension were intact. Although the alexia extended to musical notes, he could interpret other musical symbols (e.g., treble clef). Appreciation of rhythm and expressive musical ability were relatively preserved, although judgment of other musical features (including discrimination of pitch, duration, and loudness) was compromised.

26656873,Diverging receptive and expressive word processing mechanisms in a deep dyslexic reader.,"Ablinger, Irene; Radach, Ralph",Ablinger,"We report on KJ, a patient with acquired dyslexia due to cerebral artery infarction. He represents an unusually clear case of an ""output"" deep dyslexic reader, with a distinct pattern of pure semantic reading. According to current neuropsychological models of reading, the severity of this condition is directly related to the degree of impairment in semantic and phonological representations and the resulting imbalance in the interaction between the two word processing pathways. The present work sought to examine whether an innovative eye movement supported intervention combining lexical and segmental therapy would strengthen phonological processing and lead to an attenuation of the extreme semantic over-involvement in KJ's word identification process. Reading performance was assessed before (T1) between (T2) and after (T3) therapy using both analyses of linguistic errors and word viewing patterns. Therapy resulted in improved reading aloud accuracy along with a change in error distribution that suggested a return to more sequential reading. Interestingly, this was in contrast to the dynamics of moment-to-moment word processing, as eye movement analyses still suggested a predominantly holistic strategy, even at T3. So, in addition to documenting the success of the therapeutic intervention, our results call for a theoretically important conclusion: Real-time letter and word recognition routines should be considered separately from properties of the verbal output. Combining both perspectives may provide a promising strategy for future assessment and therapy evaluation.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.11.023,,Aphasia; Deep dyslexia; Eye movements; Reading strategy; Reading therapy,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The strongest confirmatory evidence was the patient's propensity for writing the individual letters of a word in nonlinear order, i.e. not left to right, sometimes even beginning in the middle of a word. The influence of whole visual word-contours was also examined. Analysis of the results suggested that, in addition to the visual element, certain phonological factors played a small part in the patient's repertoire of strategies and this was confirmed in a second experiment. The patient's multi-strategy approach to written spelling is discussed on the basis of an information-flow model.

7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/4.5.555,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Surgical evacuation of the haematoma and excision of the malformation did not produce any modification of the reading deficit, which remained unchanged during a 4-year follow-up. The reading deficit was restricted to words and the patient was able to read only letter-by-letter, so that the whole words were reconstructed from the auditory names of the letters. So far, the disconnection explanation is the standard explanation of alexia without agraphia and the present case of verbal alexia may be regarded as being within this overall category. However, this explanation meets with unanswered questions that suggest more flexible interpretations. Neurolinguistic studies have questioned the unique character of alexia without agraphia as a clinical entity and, in contrast to the disconnection hypothesis, support the notion that the different varieties of alexia that are traditionally described represent distinctive syndromes, each with its own clinical features and pathophysiological basis. In this context, the reading properties in this case seem fully compatible with a deficit of the visual word-form system postulated by Warrington and Shallice, that is, the relatively early stage of the reading process through which a word-form or equivalent unit is attained. This system might be lateralized to the left hemisphere, as suggested by the fact that this case, like other cases of verbal alexia, had sustained damage to the left hemisphere and did not show any differential preservation of the reading of concrete words.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00313647,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Oral reading accuracy and comprehension accuracy of paragraphs also improved.

The patient also showed a complete inability to access the visual representation of letters. As demonstrated by a stroke segmentation analysis, letter substitutions followed a rule of graphomotor similarity. We propose that the patient's impairment was at the stage where selection of the specific graphomotor pattern for each letter is made and that the apparent selective disruption of capital case was due to a greater stroke similarity among letters belonging to the same case.

I claim that the model-building approach to the neuropsychology of cognitive function must take precedence over the other two. One reason for this is that any disorder of cognitive function can only be defined with reference to some model of that function. I illustrate this claim with reference to acquired disorders of reading, describing current work of a psycholinguistic nature dealing with two acquired disorders of reading: phonological dyslexia and surface dyslexia. A psycholinguistic account of normal reading is used as a theoretical framework to define and to explain the patterns of deficit and preservation observed in these two dyslexias. The detailed account of surface dyslexia in English provided by this framework is then used to make predictions about the nature of surface dyslexia in other languages: alphabetically written languages where all words are regularly spelled, or where homophones cannot occur, as well as ideographically and syllabically written languages.

Yet she performs poorly with MoirÃ© and texture perception, i.e. she suffers from a selective loss of global visual perception. The alexic patient performs well with MoirÃ© patterns but neither with (complex) texture elements nor with textures. She seemingly can locally and globally process patterns composed of simple figural elements but fails with stimuli that require the integration of features. This finding of a concomitant dissociation of local and global visual processes in the two patients supports the view that prosopagnosia as well as alexia are the most conspicuous aspects of more general alterations of visual perception.",{},,Vision research,10.1016/0042-6989(94)90045-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
17166310,Temporal processing deficits in letter-by-letter reading.,"Ingles, Janet L; Eskes, Gail A",Ingles,"Theories of the cognitive impairment underlying letter-by-letter reading vary widely, including prelexical and lexical level deficits. One prominent prelexical account proposes that the disorder results from difficulty in processing multiple letters simultaneously. We investigated whether this deficit extends to letters presented in rapid temporal succession. A letter-by-letter reader, G.M., was administered a rapid serial visual presentation task that has been used widely to study the temporal processing characteristics of the normal visual system. Comparisons were made to a control group of 6 brain-damaged individuals without reading deficits. Two target letters were embedded at varying temporal positions in a stream of rapidly presented single digits. After each stream, the identities of the two letters were reported. G.M. required an extended period of time after he had processed one letter before he was able to reliably identify a second letter, relative to the controls. In addition, G.M.'s report of the second letter was most impaired when it immediately followed the first letter, a pattern not seen in the controls, indicating that G.M. had difficulty processing the two items together. These data suggest that a letter-by-letter reading strategy may be adopted to help compensate for a deficit in the temporal processing of letters.",{},,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,10.1017/S1355617707070142,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Conference; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This immune-mediated, steroid-dependent entity was first described thirty years ago. In this case report, we discuss the importance of considering this diagnosis in the evaluation of confusion. The patient is a 55-year-old African-American woman residing in United States, who was admitted to the hospital with a four-day history of mental status changes. Her past medical history was significant for type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Hypothyroidism. There was no reported seizure activity. The patient's vital signs were stable on admission. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, oriented to place and time. Her neurological examination revealed agraphia and dyslexia. Her speech showed lack of fluency and hesitation. Her complete blood count and electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient's brain CT scan did not reveal any significant findings. Her Magnetic Resonance Imaging only revealed mild chronic microangiopathy, which caused by ""small vessel disease."" Her Electroencephalogram did not reveal any finding consistent with seizure activity. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis was likewise did not reveal a cause for this patient's acute onset of confusion. In contrast to the above negative finding, this patient's Thyroid stimulating hormone was discovered to be 15 UIU/ml. She was subsequently given 1000 mg of intravenous Methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. This three-day course of high-dose, intravenous steroids resulted complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. She was then discharged on an eleven-day course of oral prednisone 60 mg. Hashimoto's Encephalopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute confusional state since it is responsive to steroid therapy and represents a readily reversible cause acute mental status changes. Clues to this diagnosis include elevated antithyroid antibodies, abnormal Thyroid stimulating hormone values, and exclusion of other causes of acute mental status changes.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cases journal,10.4076/1757-1626-2-7967,PMC2740226,,Case Reports,England,eng

We report on 2 individuals with Alzheimer's disease who show phonological dyslexia. Although highly accurate in reading familiar words aloud (even those with irregular spelling, such as sew), they were quite impaired in nonword reading. Both patients performed well in phonological tasks involving the repetition, identification, and manipulation of phonemes of orally presented words and nonwords. These results challenge the idea, proposed in the context of connectionist and evolutionary theories, that phonological dyslexia originates from a phonological deficit. However, the results are consistent with reading models, such as the dual-route model, that attribute phonological dyslexia to a deficit that selectively affects the reading mechanisms responsible for deriving the sounds of nonwords.

While results showed a lack of generalization to real-word reading aloud, improvement was present in phonological processing, language function (Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient, Boston Naming Test, Reading Comprehension Battery for Aphasia), and auditory processing (Revised Token Test). Improvement in the lexical-semantic system was attributed to informal forced-use language treatment. We concluded that phonological therapies are unlikely to be successful unless a minimum initial level of phonological sequence knowledge exists; therapies that pressure subjects to use verbal communication can achieve clinically important gains in communicative ability that generalize to untreated behaviors.

Inversely, these patients often made mistakes when asked to perform arithmetic operations (example 2 4-->""two plus four equals six"").

We interpret these findings with the hypothesis that both of the hemispheres can identify Arabic numbers, but that the visual systems on the right and left play a different role during different tasks.

A computed tomographic scan showed a right occipito-temporal infarction, which had occurred 18 months earlier. The patient demonstrated aspects of language dysfunction associated with the syndrome and showed reversed lateralization of cerebral functions. Recognizing and distinguishing between angular gyrus syndrome and depression is important because the appropriate therapies differ.

Incomplete right hemianopsia, mild pure alexia, and partially disturbed naming of visual objects persisted several months after the removal of the malformation. Evaluation of musical ability one and three months after surgery showed that her auditory recognition of music was intact. She could sing and play melodies already learned and could dictate well the notes after hearing tones. However, she had difficulty in reading music, especially the pitch of notes, even for simple sequences of 4 notes. In contrast, her rhythm reading was fairly good. Her visual recognition of other symbolic figures like road signs was also markedly impaired. These results suggest that her visual recognition of written music as well as of other symbolic figures underwent a preliminary verbal decoding in the left hemisphere and that pitch reading was more dependent on verbal processing than rhythm reading.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(97)80014-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

G.M.'s reading was exceedingly slow, although virtually error free. Analysis of his disorder indicated an inability to read words presented tachistoscopically to the left (spared) visual field. Therefore the reading deficit cannot be interpreted as simply due to the visual field reduction (hemianopic alexia). Reading speed was clearly affected by word length, a finding typical of letter-by-letter reading. Both behavioral and psychophysical testing indicated a selective reduction of visual discrimination and detection (particularly in the range of high spatial frequency information) in portions of the left hemifield which appeared spared upon perimetric examination. Overall, it is suggested that the reading deficit, phenomenologically similar to that of other letter-by-letter readers, can be interpreted as due to a combination of basic visual perturbations: visual field cut with macular splitting and deficit of processing of high spatial frequency information.",{},,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/01688639508402437,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

6883008,Phonological processes in reading: new evidence from acquired dyslexia.,"Funnell, E",Funnell,"This paper investigates the reading performance of two patients with acquired dyslexia. The first patient read aloud all classes of word (85-95 per cent correct), including affixed words, but failed to read aloud non-words. In addition, semantic judgments about written words were shown to be significantly impaired, relative to the ability to read the words aloud. These dissociations support the view that two independent lexical routes are available for reading aloud familiar words, a semantic route and a lexical phonological route. While unable to read aloud non-words, this patient retained the ability to segment orthographic and phonological stimuli. The reading of non-lexical material, therefore, does not appear to be mediated by lexical analogy procedures. Instead, it is suggested that a non-lexical phonological route exists that is clearly independent of lexical phonological procedures. This patient could process isolated written suffixes orthographically, but could only access complete phonological word forms. Suffixed words (but not isolated suffixes) appear to be represented in the phonological word store. The second patient read aloud non-words, but could not give phonetic sounds appropriate to single letters. This dissociation suggests that the reading aloud of non-words is not reliant upon grapheme-phoneme rules.",{},,"British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",10.1111/j.2044-8295.1983.tb01851.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

WH's errors in visual object naming consisted mainly of semantic paraphasias and perseverations. His verbalizations during testing sometimes manifested a conflict between correct responses and perseverations. Analysis of the stream of information from visual perception via semantics to phonology suggested incomplete access from vision to semantics as the source of errors. The disconnection did not affect verbo-visual matching, though he was unable to reject names that did not correspond to visual stimuli. Action naming was relatively spared, but naming of pictures of actions with objects was worse than naming of pictures of intransitive actions. Tactile naming worsened with simultaneous vision of objects. In visual object naming the error rate increased with increasing familiarity of objects. We propose that an interaction of excitation and inhibition within a single semantic system can explain the clinical phenomena of modality specific visual misnaming.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70509-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Based on previous studies, the fusiform gyrus has been associated with ideogram reading. We examine serial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images in a patient exhibiting dissociation of Hanja and Hangul reading to identify brain areas associated with Hanja reading. fMRI were taken of a 63-year-old man showing profound Hanja alexia with normal Hangul reading after an acute stroke involving the left frontal and parietal lobes, who later spontaneously recovered his Hanja reading ability. Scans were taken while performing Hanja and Hangul reading tasks on three occasions.
