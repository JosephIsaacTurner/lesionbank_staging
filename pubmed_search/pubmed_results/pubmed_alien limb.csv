33897336,Unilateral neglect or alien hand syndrome? A diagnostic challenge.,"Wan Yusoff, Wan R; Hanafi, Muhammad H; Ibrahim, Al Hafiz; Kassim, Nur K; Suhaimi, Anwar",Wan Yusoff,"Alien hand syndrome (AHS) is a rare post-stroke complication. Although the occurrence of AHS after stroke is rare, it can have a disabling impact on the lifestyle and career of the patients post stroke. It is difficult to distinguish AHS from the non-dominant hemispheric infarction with symptoms of hemianopia and left hemineglect, as patients with AHS can also have neglect as well as behaviour symptoms if the frontal lobe is involved. We report the case of a 62-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the rehabilitation ward and was treated for neglect and apraxia following right middle cerebral artery stroke. After further re-evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with AHS. Functionally, he improved and the symptoms disappeared four months after the stroke. In this case report, we highlight the features of AHS and provide a unique management approach.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences,10.1016/j.jtumed.2020.12.003,PMC8046948,Alien hand syndrome; Apraxias; Neglect; Rehabilitation; Stroke,Case Reports,Saudi Arabia,eng
35696732,Reach planning with someone else's hand.,"Rossi Sebastiano, Alice; Poles, Karol; Miller, Luke E; Fossataro, Carlotta; Milano, Edoardo; Gindri, Patrizia; Garbarini, Francesca",Rossi Sebastiano,"To investigate the relationship between the sense of body ownership and motor control, we capitalized on a rare bizarre disorder wherein another person's hand is misattributed to their own body, i.e., a pathological form of embodiment (E+). Importantly, despite E+ is usually associated with motor deficits, we had the opportunity to test two E+ patients with spared motor function, thus able to perform a reaching task. Crucially, these patients had proprioceptive deafferentation, allowing us to purely isolate the embodiment-dependent effect from proprioception-dependent ones that are usually associated in experimental manipulations of body ownership in healthy participants. Previous evidence suggests that the reaching movement vector is attracted towards an embodied hand during the rubber hand illusion (RHI). However, these results are confounded by the spared proprioception, whose modulation alone could explain the effects on reach planning. The neuropsychological approach employed here provides unambiguous evidence about the role of body ownership in reach planning. Indeed, three brain-damaged patients with proprioceptive deafferentation, two E+ and a well-matched control patient without pathological embodiment (E-), and 10 age-matched healthy controls underwent a reaching task wherein they had to reach for a target from a fixed starting point, while an alien hand (the co-experimenter's) was placed on the table. Irrespective of proprioception, damaged in all patients, only in E+ patients reaching errors were significantly more shifted consistently with the pathological belief, i.e., as if they planned movements from the position of the alien (embodied) hand, as compared to controls. Furthermore, with an additional experiment on healthy participants, we demonstrated that reaching errors observed during the RHI correlate with the changes in ownership. In conclusion, our neuropsychological approach suggests that when planning a reach, we do so from where our owned hand is and not from its physical location.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2022.05.005,,Body ownership; Motor planning; Pathological embodiment; Proprioception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

32850052,Alien hand syndrome - a rare presentation of stroke.,"Le, Kelly; Zhang, Christine; Greisman, Lisa",Le,"Alien Hand Syndrome (AHS) is characterized by intermittent and involuntary movements of a single limb that is not associated with motor dysfunction. AHS may be the initial presentation of serious underlying pathology, such as stroke localized to the non-dominant parietal lobe, corpus callosum damage, or neurodegenerative disease. AHS occurs at a low prevalence in the general population yet represents significant underlying disease burden, necessitating early identification. In this case report, we present an 88-year-old right-handed male with involuntary movement of his left forearm and hand three hours prior to presentation. His symptom corresponded to findings on MRI of the brain, which showed acute infarcts of the right temporal lobe, right parietal cortex, and right parietal subcortex. Infarction of the right parietal cortex accounted for his AHS. The multifocal nature of the infarcts elevated the index of suspicion for an embolic source.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,10.1080/20009666.2020.1756610,PMC7425627,Alien hand syndrome; callosal; frontal; posterior variant; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

Aside from rapidly progressive dementia, this condition manifests as myoclonus, cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, visual, and psychiatric symptoms. On the other hand, nonspecific symptoms might be difficult to diagnose, leading to a late or incorrect diagnosis. Given its high fatality, most patients die within 12 months of the disease'sÂ onset. This case report describes a healthy man who presented with cerebellar and pyramidal signs along with memory loss worsening over six weeks.Â He also had indications of corticobasal degeneration, such as myoclonus and alien limb syndrome, but with reasonably maintained cognition. These signs are all non-specific, and premortem diagnosis is typically difficult and challenging owing to a lack of knowledge and clinical suspicion. However, after a thorough and extensive investigation, CJD was diagnosed. Despite the fact that CJD is a rare disease, it should always be included in the differential diagnosis whenever neuropsychological manifestations are present. Nevertheless, CJD can be successfully and promptly ruled out with a detailed clinical examination and appropriate investigation.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.31303,PMC9647838,creutzfeldt-jakob disease; high fatality; prion disease; rapidly progressive dementia; rare neurodegenerative disease,Case Reports,United States,eng

The mixed callosal-frontal variant of alien hand syndrome is associated with uncoordinated hand movements, and patients may present with an involuntary grasp reflex and intermanual conflict. There are few videos in the existing literature on the comparison of patients' condition before and after recovery of the symptoms of mixed alien hand syndrome. We presented the prognosis of mixed alien hand syndrome in the form of a video. In addition, we have included some videos on the comparison of the condition of patients before and after recovery of the symptoms of mixed alien hand syndrome. A 57-year-old woman presented with left-handed intermanual conflict and right-handed involuntary grasp reflex due to infarction of the frontal lobe and corpus callosum. She was diagnosed with a mixed callosal-frontal variant of alien hand syndrome. Her left hand counteracted the purposeful movements of the right hand. However, the intermanual conflict disappeared after 3 months of therapy, including drug treatment and verbal-cue rehabilitation, and she regained normal coordination of her hand movements. Her prognosis was good despite the large corpus callosum lesions. The uncoordinated hand movements of the patient affected her daily life and caused psychological problems. Initiating rehabilitation early was important and necessary for her to regain coordination. It is possible that the verbal-cue training method played an important role in the recovery of the patient. Therefore, this method of rehabilitation deserves consideration and can be adopted in larger cohort studies as we presented only a single case. The possible mechanisms behind the verbal-cue exercise require further studies, and this patient had a good prognosis despite severe corpus callosum injury, which may merit further investigation.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.718706,PMC8455835,alien hand syndrome; case report; cerebral infarction; corpus callosum; prognosis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The most widely recognized variants in literature are frontal, callosal, and posterior AHS. AHS due to the corpus callosum lesion can occur alone or as part of callosal disconnection syndrome (CDS). This report presents a unique CDS case manifesting clinical features from all three AHS variants, resulting from an extensive corpus callosum infarct. Our patient exhibited various clinical features from the three AHS variants, which include grasping, groping, and difficulty releasing objects from the hand (anterior); intermanual conflict (callosal); arm levitation, mild hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss (posterior). Additionally, the extensive disruption of the corpus callosal fibers produced neurological manifestations of CDS, such as cognitive impairment, ideomotor and constructional apraxia, behavioral disorder, and transcortical motor aphasia. We employed a range of rehabilitation interventions, such as mirror box therapy, limb restraint strategy, verbal cue training, cognitive behavioral therapy, bimanual hand training, speech and language therapy, and pharmacological treatment with clonazepam. The patient showed almost complete resolution of CDS and AHS features by nine months post-stroke Our case report highlights distinctive clinical variations of AHS and the challenging correlation between clinical manifestations and neuroanatomical substrates. Future studies are necessary to explore the intricate neural connections and the precise function of the corpus callosum. This can be achieved by combining comprehensive neuropsychological testing with diffusion tensor tractography studies. It is also essential to develop a validated tool to standardize AHS assessment. Finally, the scarcity of evidence in rehabilitation interventions necessitates further studies to address the wide knowledge gap in AHS and CDS management.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,F1000Research,10.12688/f1000research.133838.1,PMC11074696,alien hand syndrome; brain infarction; case report; corpus callosum; middle cerebral artery stroke; rehabilitation outcome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

By extensively examining a patient with AHS we provide novel neuropsychological and lesion mapping data that shed new light on the possibility of modulating specific symptoms associated with AHS, in particular unilateral apraxia and magnetic apraxia. Moreover, we compared lesion mapping data with an in depth analysis of previous studies in order to explore the neural network responsible for the complex symptomatology associated with this syndrome. We found that non-primarily motor variables (e.g. the nature of the object to be grasped and integration of visuo-spatial feedback in action) play an important role in determining AHS symptomatology. Moreover, we found that lesions involving various different parts of the motor control network (the corpus callosum, the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, the parietal areas and thalamus) are closely linked to partially differing AHS symptoms. The comparison of our data with those reported in previous studies indicate that AHS is a multifaceted and complex syndrome in which the influence of non-primarily motor, emotional and higher-order components may be largely underestimated.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.10.005,,Anarchic hand syndrome; Dangerous stimulus; Magnetic apraxia; Unilateral apraxia; Visual observation perspective,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common form of human prion disease. Electroencephalography (EEG)-detected changes such as periodic sharp wave complexes, superimposable to those seen in non-convulsive epileptic status (NCSE), have only rarely been described at CJD onset, especially in sporadic CJD (sCJD) cases. We describe clinical, EEG, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging findings of a confirmed case of sCJD with tau pathology, initially diagnosed as NCSE. We performed a literature review in PubMed of previous publications on both sCJD and NCSE. An 82-year-old woman with no medical history presented with a 2-week rapidly progressive neurological disorder, with motor aphasia, myoclonus, pyramidalism, and left posterior alien hand. EEG showed periodic sharp waves on right frontal regions, so anti-epileptic treatment was started. CSF results were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated hyperintensity of the right cerebral cortex in diffusion sequences. Due to suspected new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), corticosteroid treatment was started, without clinical improvement. Necropsy results confirmed sCJD with tau pathology. The literature review identified 14 references including a total of 18 cases with NCSE as the presenting symptom of sCJD; the clinical and results in complementary tests were compiled into a table. Sporadic CJD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with rapid cognitive decline and EEG changes consistent with NCSE. The wide heterogeneity in the etiology of NCSE, including autoimmune disorders, especially NORSE, suggests immunotherapy should be initiated based on a good risk-benefit balance. Some cases of sCJD, such as the present case with tau pathology, may mimic this clinico-electrical course.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,European journal of neurology,10.1111/ene.14624,,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; non-convulsive; periodic sharp wave complexes; status epilepticus; tau,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Reports are scarce about the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We report the case G.H. who developed the syndrome after infarction of the left arteria pericallosa. It has been suggested that the syndrome arises out of lacking inhibition from the dominant left hemisphere on the right hemisphere. Yet, in tests of spatial intelligence G.H. performed much better with his ""anarchic"" left hand than with his dominant right hand, similar to observations commonly reported in split-brain patients. Left-right manual choice responses and event-related EEG potentials to laterally presented stimuli were measured. Asymmetries were evident in G.H.'s behavior and EEG potentials, different from age-matched healthy participants (n=11). His right-hand responses were fast and unaffected by incompatibility with stimulus location, whereas his left-hand responses were variable and accompanied by a large negative central-midline EEG potential, probably reflecting efforts in initiating the response. G.H.'s visual N1 component peaked earlier and was larger at the right than the left side of the scalp, and the P3 component was distinctly reduced at the right side. Both features occurred independent of side of stimulus presentation and side of responding hand. The effort indicated by the midline negativity and the asymmetrically reduced P3 might directly reflect G.H.'s lack of control on his right hemisphere's processing. The faster visual processing of the right hemisphere suggested by the N1 asymmetry might contribute to ""anarchic"" processing, making the right hemisphere process stimuli before control impulses exert their effect. These neurophysiological results tend to support the split-brain account which assumes that the syndrome arises by the lack of communication between hemispheres that act according to their respective competences.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2011.05.004,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a ""magnetic apraxia"" associated with frontal lobe damage. Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient. The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent. They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's ""extravolitional"" activity. The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed ""self-restriction."" In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand. In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand. Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke. These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the ""dual premotoer systems hypothesis,"" an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties. It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere. The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior.

Two observations about AH patients have received little, if any, experimental confirmation. The first is that AH is triggered opportunistically by nearby objects. The second is that AH behaviors are increased in conditions of fatigue or anxiety, i.e. under reduced attentional control. A prominent account explains AH as reduced intention-driven (endogenous) executive control. This account predicts that erroneous AH behaviors should be driven by environmental (i.e. exogenous) factors, such as distractor proximity to the hand. AH errors should be less influenced by the intention or action plan (i.e. endogenous factors), such as the semantic relatedness of distractors to targets. Moreover, due to capacity limitations of the endogenous controller, AH behaviors should increase under conditions of secondary task load. We tested these predictions with an AH patient in two experiments using a naturalistic coffee-making task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the affected hand was highly perseverative and strongly influenced by exogenous but not endogenous factors. The non-alien hand made fewer errors. Experiment 2 showed that there was a disproportionate increase in perseverations and exogenous errors of the affected hand under secondary task load. The non-alien hand was significantly less disrupted by dual task conditions.

The authors report on a 79-year-old man who sustained a right posterior cerebral artery distribution infarction and developed alien hand syndrome in the absence of callosal involvement. Also unique is that the patient perceived the alien hand as acceptable and positive, not hostile and repugnant. This case suggests not only that the neuroanatomic regions responsible for alien hand syndrome may require re-examination, but also that its definition may need expansion.",{},,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/s0003-9993(99)90114-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report here an oculomotor and computational study of a patient with a long lasting form of DD. A first series of oculomotor paradigms revealed marked and unprecedented saccade impairments. We used a computational model in order to provide information about the impaired decision-making process: the analysis of saccade latencies revealed that variations of decision times were explained by adjustments of response criterion. This result and paradoxical impairments observed in additional oculomotor paradigms allowed to propose that this adjustment of the criterion level resulted from the co-existence of counteracting oculomotor programs, consistent with the existence of antagonist programs in homotopic cortical areas. In the intact brain, trans-hemispheric inhibition would allow suppression of these counter programs. Depending on the topography of the disconnected areas, various motor and/or behavioural impairments would arise in split-brain subjects. In motor systems, such conflict would result in increased criteria for desired movement execution (oculomotor system) or in simultaneous execution of counteracting movements (skeletal motor system). At higher cognitive levels, it may result in conflict of intentions.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.04.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We would like to call these phenomena ""forced mouth opening reactions"" because they were uncontrollable voluntarily. They may be divided into two groups, i.e. visual and tactile ""forced mouth opening reactions"". In all the patients the neurological, neuro-imaging and neuropathological data showed that the frontal lobes were damaged. Additionally, they had some frontal lobe release signs such as forced grasping, forced groping, or alien limb sign. We would like to apply the mechanism for these release signs to the ""forced mouth opening reactions"". Thus, we speculate that the frontal lobe contains a higher motor control mechanism for normal mouth opening movement, and the ""forced mouth opening reactions"" result from impairment of this control.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
