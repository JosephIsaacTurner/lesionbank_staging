A 57-year-old diabetic man presented with sudden painless diminution of vision, metamorphopsia, and color vision deficits in the left eye (OS) for one month. His vision was 20/20 in the right eye (OD) and 20/40 OS. Ophthalmic examination revealed left relative afferent pupillary defect, blurred optic nerve margin, creamy chorioretinal infiltration around the optic disc, and mild macular edema. OD examination was non-revealing. Chest CT scan with contrast showed calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, but biopsy of the lymph nodes was normal. Brain and orbit MRI demonstrated soft tissue abnormality with enhancement in left orbital apex with involvement of the extraocular muscles. CSF culture was negative, but complement fixation had positive titer of 1:2 for CI. The patient was diagnosed with CI meningitis, and antifungal therapy was initiated. Slight visual and symptomatic improvement was observed, which was not completely satisfactory. Biopsy of extraocular orbital muscle five months later revealed non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, leading to initiation of prednisone trial therapy. Nine months later, the patient was referred to a tertiary center owing to persistence of optic disc edema OS. PET CT was consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Antifungal treatment was discontinued, and oral prednisone with methotrexate was initiated. Subsequently, methotrexate was replaced by infliximab to further manage ocular inflammation and neurologic symptoms which was effective. Vision was 20/20 OD and 20/30 OS at the most recent visit. Signs and symptoms of neurosarcoidosis and coccidioidomycosis can be similar and deceiving. The index case underscores importance of considering appropriate differential diagnoses in patients with similar symptoms and signs who may respond to preliminary designated treatment but not to the optimal extent. Considering such possibility could assist clinicians in managing the patients timely and efficiently.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,International medical case reports journal,10.2147/IMCRJ.S434632,PMC10758176,coccidioidomycosis; neurosarcoidosis; ocular involvement; sarcoidosis,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

We examined a patient who, after a right occipito-parietal stroke, subjectively reported perceiving everything at seventy percent of the actual size. Using experimental tasks, we confirmed the extent of his micropsia at 70%. Visual half-field tests showed an impaired perception of shape, location and motion in the left visual field. As his micropsia concerns the complete visual field, we suggest that it is caused by a higher-order compensation process in order to reconcile the conflicting information from the two hemifields.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2019.1656751,,Micropsia; metamorphopsia; neuropsychology; occipito-parietal infarction; visual perceptual impairment,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
19334315,The role of Funktionswandel in metamorphopsia.,"Nijboer, Tanja C W; Ruis, Carla; van der Worp, H Bart; De Haan, Edward H F",Nijboer,"Patients with metamorphopsia perceive objects or faces as being distorted and/or different in size. In most cases, recognition is not impaired. The stimulus specificity, particularly in the case of face perception, has led to the suggestion that metamorphopsia is a deficit at the entry level of category-specific recognition systems; in this case, the face processing system. An explanation in terms of a visuosensory deficit (i.e., Funktionswandel) that affects the perception of specific stimulus categories has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we report two patients (MZ and CM) who experienced hemi-metamorphopsia for faces after a stroke in the posterior part of the brain. Despite the distortions, they could still match and recognize faces. We carried out a detailed evaluation of their visual-sensory status and found that both MZ and CM had specific problems with discriminating and estimating sizes and shapes, especially in the contralesional visual field. It was concluded that these cases, metamorphopsia was not due to a higher-order perception impairment specific for faces, but rather of a specific impairment in shape perception in the contralesional visual field that proportionally affects the perception of faces.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x256563,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of both facial metamorphopsia and palinopsia occurring as the symptoms of demyelinating brain lesions consistent with an acute MS exacerbation.

17804619,Human adult cortical reorganization and consequent visual distortion.,"Dilks, Daniel D; Serences, John T; Rosenau, Benjamin J; Yantis, Steven; McCloskey, Michael",Dilks,"Neural and behavioral evidence for cortical reorganization in the adult somatosensory system after loss of sensory input (e.g., amputation) has been well documented. In contrast, evidence for reorganization in the adult visual system is far less clear: neural evidence is the subject of controversy, behavioral evidence is sparse, and studies combining neural and behavioral evidence have not previously been reported. Here, we report converging behavioral and neuroimaging evidence from a stroke patient (B.L.) in support of cortical reorganization in the adult human visual system. B.L.'s stroke spared the primary visual cortex (V1), but destroyed fibers that normally provide input to V1 from the upper left visual field (LVF). As a consequence, B.L. is blind in the upper LVF, and exhibits distorted perception in the lower LVF: stimuli appear vertically elongated, toward and into the blind upper LVF. For example, a square presented in the lower LVF is perceived as a rectangle extending upward. We hypothesized that the perceptual distortion was a consequence of cortical reorganization in V1. Extensive behavioral testing supported our hypothesis, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) confirmed V1 reorganization. Together, the behavioral and fMRI data show that loss of input to V1 after a stroke leads to cortical reorganization in the adult human visual system, and provide the first evidence that reorganization of the adult visual system affects visual perception. These findings contribute to our understanding of the human adult brain's capacity to change and has implications for topics ranging from learning to recovery from brain damage.",{},,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2650-07.2007,PMC2695877,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng
32516303,Cerebellar Parieto-occipital Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and Cerebral Metamorphopsia Associated with Asymptomatic Atrial Septum Vegetation and Renal Disease: Case Report.,"Ghaffari-Rafi, Arash; Netzel, Anthony C; Prat, Madeline; Miles, Daniel T",Ghaffari-Rafi,"BACKGROUND Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a poorly characterized and enigmatic syndrome. Despite consistently presenting with nervous system vasogenic edema, this malady has been associated with variable triggers, neurological symptoms, and natural history. CASE REPORT The report presents a 25-year old African American female who presented with altered mental status and bilateral cortical blindness. Neuroimaging identified vasogenic edema in the cerebellum, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. Her PRES was associated with a hypertensive emergency, renal failure, and an atrial septum vegetation (culture-negative endocarditis). All 3 contributing etiologies were addressed, upon which the patient began to recover. During recovery, the patient experienced cerebral metamorphopsia, visualizing her entire environment in the form of a cartoon. After 2 weeks of treatment she recovered to baseline state of heath, with vasogenic edema resolved on follow-up neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS This case presents a rarely catalogued phenomena during PRES recovery, cerebral metamorphopsia, along with a new potential association (culture negative atrial septum endocarditis). The report also highlights how PRES recovery patients (with cortical blindness) should be explicitly assessed for cerebral metamorphopsia and Charles Bonnet syndrome - which may distress patients. Lastly, the atypical presentation of cerebellar vasogenic edema in our patient validates existing literature that PRES does not have a uniform picture and is not well served by its current name or proposed diagnostic criteria. Therefore, renaming the disorder to reversible vasogenic edema syndrome and derestricting the diagnostic criteria, may prevent clinicians from being discouraged when faced with diagnosing PRES in the face of atypical findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.923441,PMC7304656,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe the case of a 64-year-old male patient who first experienced a 90-degree rotation of the field of vision and then had the impression of his body rotating in space. The symptoms were preceded by disequilibrium, astigmatism and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed focuses of vasogenic lesions in the pons and left cerebellar hemisphere.

Reversal of vision metamorphopsia (RVM) is a rare transient form of metamorphopsia described as an upside-down, 180 degrees rotation of the visual field in the coronal plane. The pathophysiological characteristics of RVM remain unclear. Patients with RVM had a complete neurologic examination during or shortly after an episode of metamorphopsia, with particular emphasis on gaze disorders, visual fields, visually guided hand movements, and perceptual or cognitive deficits. Workup included imaging studies, visual field examinations, and brainstem auditory and visual evoked response. Department of Neurology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel. Six consecutive patients were evaluated from 1991 to 1996. Five patients had parieto-occipital brain insult sparing the primary visual cortex, and 3 also had evidence of a concomitant brainstem or cerebellar syndrome. One patient had pure brainstem syndrome underlying the RVM. Three patients had complete RVM as well as oblique RVM of less than 180 degrees. These cases imply a possible anatomical localization of the central integrator of visual extrapersonal orientation. Our observations suggest that a separate central mechanism of visual orientation might exist in each cerebral hemisphere and that occipital and parietal lesions that spare the optic radiations may account for the oblique and complete RVM. We postulate that failure to perceive space in an allocentric coordinate frame, particularly in the coronal roll plane, is potentially the critical event underlying RVM.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.55.10.1362,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

11744780,Visual and tactile size distortion in a patient with right neglect.,"Pritchard, C L; Dijkerman, H C; McIntosh, R D; Milner, A D",Pritchard,"One typical feature of the neglect syndrome in patients with right hemisphere damage is that they bisect horizontal lines to the right of centre. It has been argued that to a large extent these bisection errors can be attributed to a perceptual change whereby the patient experiences the left half of a line as shorter than the right half, causing them to set the midpoint of the line towards the right. We describe here a patient with a left hemisphere lesion and rightward neglect, who consequently makes bisection errors in a leftward direction. We carried out a series of tests which confirmed that he shows a subjective visual distortion in the converse direction, i.e. a perception of horizontal extents on the right as shorter than extents on the left. We also found that he shows a similar distortion in his tactile perception. The association of visual and tactile distortions in this patient is compatible with the view that the distortion effects have a rather high-level origin. Multiple single-case studies will, however, be required to establish whether this association of deficits is typical, or whether visual and tactile size distortions are separable symptoms associated with neglect.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.7.5.391.16246,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The disorder involved the right hemisphere in 9 cases, the left hemisphere in 3 cases and both hemispheres sequentially in one patient. Hallucinations were accompanied by palinopsia in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case. This particular type of hallucination is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes. Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects. There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story. In most cases, the hallucinations were not clearly related to any visual memory. It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative. The occurrence of such hallucinations with a visual field defect suggests that the cells of the association cortex are more likely to discharge spontaneously once they are deprived of their normal afferent inflow from the calcarine cortex.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/99.4.719,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It generally involves a full 180 degrees rotation of the visual field in the coronal plane. Its chief causation is vertebrobasilar ischaemia, although the phenomenon has also been linked to many other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, migraine or traumatic head and neck injuries. Some notable features of reversal of vision metamorphopsia are the wide topographic variety of the lesions responsible for the condition, the transient nature of the symptom and its improvement or resolution in the presence of certain stimuli.

A magnetic resonance scan enabled us to identify an acute ischaemic cerebellar lesion as the cause of the condition.

Symptoms of this syndrome typically include an altered body image, size perception, and time perception. However, the pathophysiology and lesions responsible for this syndrome remain unclear. In most cases, specific lesions cannot be identified using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Two patients with isolated cortical venous thrombosis in the right occipital area experienced transient visual symptoms of AIWS. Furthermore, a literature search indicated that AIWS with visual distortions is associated with right occipital lobe lesions, supporting the findings of our study.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.2169/internalmedicine.2092-23,PMC11309861,Alice in Wonderland syndrome; isolated cortical venous thrombosis; metamorphopsia; occipital lobe; stroke; visual distortion,Journal Article; Case Reports,Japan,eng

Brain image and blood perfusion studies showed an old right occipital lesion with hemodynamic changes. Electroencephalograms performed immediately just after the disappearance of all the above-mentioned symptoms subsided and four months later showed similar findings, some isolated independent sharp waves over bilateral temporal areas, with right posterior extension. These were independent of her visual symptoms.

A 42-year-old woman developed a complaint of visual distortion, visual disturbance, headache and mild psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and depression. She was diagnosed as VKH through the fidings of fluorescein fundus angiography, which revealed patchy hypofluorescence associated with delayed choroidal filling at early fluorescein angiographic phase, and spotted choroidal hyperfluorescence and pooling of dye at late phase. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed slight increase of leukocyte count (49/microl, mononuclear cells) and immunoglobulin (Ig) G index. An anti-GluRepsilon2 IgM antibody was positive in CSF. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a monofocal hyperintensity lesion in the left parahippocampal gyrus on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. We diagnosed her VKH disease associated with non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis. She was treated with oral prednisone, 70 mg day and her symptoms have gradually improved. To our knowledge, meningoencephalitis in VKH disease is extremely rare and the analysis of anti-GluRepsilon2 IgM antibody in CSF has not been reported. We speculate that a certain immunologic mechanism, including the anti-GluRepsilon2 IgM antibody, contributes to the pathogenesis of the VKH disease with non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.49.483,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

One day on waking, she realized that the faces of her family members appeared distorted. She consulted an ophthalmologist at a nearby clinic in the vicinity and was diagnosed with left homonymous hemianopsia. Since a cerebrovascular disease was suspected, she was referred to clinic A. Brain MRI revealed a cerebral infarction in the right temporo-occipital area. Neurologically there was no other significant sign besides left homonymous hemianopsia and the visual disorder. Metamorphosia was the major visual disorder detected; in the patient's word ""left half of the faces of people walking on the street in the opposite direction appeared distorted; they looked like monsters."" With conservative medical treatment, the condition remitted; nevertheless, the right visual field metamorphopsia persisted for over 3 years.

Subdural EEG recordings during visual seizures revealed onsets in the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. Her ictal visual distortion was probably caused by activation of V5, an area involved in motion perception. Given that the tumor location corresponds with the ictal onset in the V5 area, and the semiology of her seizures, this case supports that epileptic dysfunction in V5 can cause illusions of visual motion.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/01.wnl.0000090464.03392.9b,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

2813606,[A case of delayed postanoxic encephalopathy with bilateral lesions of the corpus striatum].,"Yoshida, T",Yoshida,"Delayed neurological deterioration following anoxia is known to result from carbon monoxide exposure. However, it may also occur with anoxia of other types as well. The present report describes a case of delayed postanoxic encephalopathy with bilateral striatal lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. A 27-year-old man exhibited anoxic anoxia caused by upper airway obstruction following general anesthesia for shoulder fracture surgery. Initially he was delirious and markedly excited for one day and became apparently normal for the following three days. Then he relapsed into delayed neurological deterioration with speech and gait disturbance, clumsiness of hand, pyramidal signs and metamorphopsia. Thereafter, he became bed-ridden and fell into semicomatose state with marked motor restlessness, involuntary movement of the tongue and decorticate posture. Twenty-five days later he had a second recovery period after hyperbaric oxygenation that lead to the sequelae with speech and motor disturbances and mild mental changes. I examined the present case as an expert witness in a civil suit eleven years after initial anoxia. The patient showed slight intellectual impairment and personality change. Impairment in figure-ground differentiation and disorders of spatial thought were also observed. Neurological examination revealed anisocoria, dysarthria with acquired stuttering, disturbances of fractionated movement of fingers, writer's cramp and Babinski's sign bilaterally. Postural dystonia of both hands and fingers, rigidity and spasticity of all extremities were also present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral lesions of the corpus striatum, especially of the putamen. Some portion of the caudate nucleus was also involved. Cerebral cortices and white matter were slightly atrophic. From the above clinical course and neurological findings, we diagnosed the present case as delayed postanoxic encephalopathy. Ginsberg (1979) noted that in cases of anoxia not related to carbon monoxide, diffuse demyelinative changes of cerebral hemispheral white matter tended to be associated with relapsing clinical course, and gray matter injury was only seen in a few cases. MRI findings in the present case suggest that main site of the lesion to be in gray matter of the corpus striatum. In this respect, the present case is considered to be noteworthy.",{},,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

A right occipital lesion was disclosed by an isotopic brain scan and a CT scan. The CT scan also disclosed a generalized cerebral atrophy. Memory disturbance, both verbal and visual, was observed. Verbal memory was examined by coupled words test, digit span and 10-words learning test, and visual memory by spatial pointing span and memorizing unfamiliar faces. The patient was able to differentiate unfamiliar faces, but was not able to memorize them correctly. Although the patient has complained of a disturbance of recognizing familiar faces (prosopagnosia), but actually, sometimes he was able to recognize the members of his family by the faces and sometimes he was not.

11086397,[Orthostatic hypotension with repeated bilateral limb shaking and metamorphopsia. A case of hemodynamic transient ischemic attacks].,"Wada, Y; Kita, Y; Yamamoto, T",Wada,"A 78-year-old right-handed man with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension and a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis presented over 2 years with recurrent, stereotyped attacks of bilateral limb shaking and metamorphopsia, which were precipitated by standing more than 3 or 4 minutes, or walking a few meters. These symptoms would resolve upon squatting or lying down and did not occur spontaneously at rest. He did not lose consciousness during the attacks. Speech, power, and sensation were preserved during these attacks. He had no history of seizures or habit of smoking. On examination, his supine blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg, and 62/27 mmHg on standing, with the pulse rate being 61/min and 66/min, respectively. Although he showed orthostatic hypotension, he did not complain of fainting or lightheadedness on standing alone. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed mild periventricular white matter changes and multiple small ischemic lesions bilaterally in the cerebral deep white matter. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed mild, generalized slowing of nonspecific feature. EEG monitoring during a limb shaking episode showed no epileptiform abnormalities. Cerebral angiogram revealed a moderate degree of stenosis of the left internal carotid and a mild degree of stenosis of the right internal carotid, the right vertebral arteries and the left vertebral arteries. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed a moderate compromise of perfusion of the left internal carotid territory. After managing both hypotension and orthostatic hypotension with antihypotensive medication and levothyroxine sodium, his symptoms dramatically disappeared. Thus, we diagnosed that transient hemodynamic insufficiency due to combination of vascular stenosis and hypotension was the cause of these symptoms. Limb shaking is a well-described presentation of carotid artery occlusive disease and is usually unilateral. Bilateral limb shaking is rare and only 2 cases have been reported. Metamorphopsia is also a rare symptom of vertebrobasilar ischemia. We suggest that bilateral limb shaking correlates with hypoperfusion in the anterior border zones and metamorphopsia with that in the posterior border zones of both hemispheres. Hemodynamic TIA should be considered as a cause of movement disorders affecting four limbs.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
