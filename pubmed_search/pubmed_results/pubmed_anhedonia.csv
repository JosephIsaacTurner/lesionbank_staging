16542786,Rapid recovery from major depression using magnesium treatment.,"Eby, George A; Eby, Karen L",Eby,"Major depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sense of inadequacy, despondency, decreased activity, pessimism, anhedonia and sadness where these symptoms severely disrupt and adversely affect the person's life, sometimes to such an extent that suicide is attempted or results. Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.047,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
39071075,An Unusual Case of Limbic Encephalitis Caused by Whipple Disease.,"Miller, Aimee; Park, Johann C; Penney, Angela; Geraghty, John J; Lui, Forshing",Miller,"Whipple disease (WD), a multisystemic infectious disorder caused by <i>Tropheryma whipplei</i> (<i>T. whipplei</i>), typically presents with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI bleeding, and weight loss. Uncommonly, it can also involve the central nervous system (CNS) and may present with a range of symptoms, including personality changes, dementia, and rhombencephalitis. Prompt antibiotic treatment and careful follow-up are crucial for favorable patient outcomes and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. In this case, we describe a 46-year-old male with primary CNS-WD and discuss the symptomatic manifestations, diagnostic findings, differential diagnosis, and management. This patient initially presented with arthritic complaints and, over a five-year period, developed progressive neurocognitive symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, retrograde amnesia, personality changes, aphasia, anhedonia, dysarthria, and rapidly progressive dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed symmetric T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, hippocampi, and hypothalamus. A lumbar puncture (LP) showed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, with no autoimmune or paraneoplastic causes. Temporal lobe biopsy revealed rod-like structures, and <i>T. whipplei</i> DNA was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for WD in patients presenting with atypical symptoms with rapidly progressive dementia, as early detection and management are key to circumventing irreversible neurological damage and death.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.65385,PMC11283316,arthritis; dementia; limbic encephalitis; nervous central system; neuroimaging; tropheryma whipplei; whipple's disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
32547840,Subependymal Giant-cell Astrocytoma Masquerading as Restrictive Eating Disorder and Depression in an Adolescent.,"Barnes, Alicia; Wang, Maggie M; Feltes, Jordan; Ko, Je; Guzman, Miguel A",Barnes,"Recent studies have shown that psychiatric symptoms might be the only primary manifestation of central nervous system malignancy. As a result, clinicians might overlook a brain tumor diagnosis due to overlying psychiatric symptoms. We herein describe an adolescent female patient without tuberous sclerosis clinical features whose primary presentation for a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma was restrictive eating disorder, urinary incontinence, and depression. The behavioral symptoms improved significantly following tumor resection. This case illustrates that compression of the frontal lobes and hypothalamus can manifest as primary psychiatric symptoms of subacutely manifested anhedonia, appetite loss, low energy, flat affect, and depressive mood. An absence of tuberous sclerosis clinical features should not preclude a diagnosis of subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion for a brain tumor in patients with sudden-onset restrictive eating disorder and depression.",{},,Innovations in clinical neuroscience,,PMC7239562,Feeding and eating disorders; adolescent; astrocytoma; brain neoplasms; depression,Case Reports,United States,eng
30663968,Is bupropion useful in the treatment of post-stroke thalamic apathy? A case report and considerations.,"Aragona, B; De Luca, R; Piccolo, A; Le Cause, M; Destro, M; Casella, C; Filoni, S; Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore",Aragona,"Post-stroke apathy is considered to be one of the clinical consequences of lesions affecting the structures of the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus and limbic system. However, there is no current consensus on the treatment of post-stroke apathy, which mainly depends on the underlying etiology and comorbidities. A 62-year-old man, affected by hemorrhagic stroke in the left thalamus, presented with mood depression, anhedonia, hyporexia and marked apathy. The patient underwent clinical evaluation before and after receiving two different pharmacological therapies: escitalopram and bupropion. Only after treatment with the latter drug did the patient show changes: high motivation and willingness to pursue activities, greater interest in the external environment and social life activities, and an overall reduction of apathy. On the basis of our observations in this case, we hypothesize that the thalamic lesion resulted in disconnection of the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits, and that loss of the dopaminergic striatal innervation caused the patient's apathetic state. The resolution of the apathetic disorder may be attributable to the action of the dopaminergic drug bupropion on the mesocortical pathway.",{},,Functional neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
17566941,Unusual clinical manifestation of a cerebral infarction restricted to the insulate cortex.,"Metin, Bariş; Melda, Bozluolcay; Birsen, Ince",Metin,"Lesions limited to the insulate cortex can manifest clinically in various forms due to the extensive connections in the area. In this paper, we present a 66-year-old patient who presented to our out-patient clinic with complaints of diminished pleasure in taste and persistent taste of rotten melon. These symptoms were linked to an infarction involving the left anterior insulate cortex. The role of the insular region on cortical processing of taste sensation is discussed, together with a review of the literature on insular infarctions.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790701316100,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

15905756,Electroconvulsive therapy in a middle-aged adult with cortical atrophy.,"Amison, Terako; Foster, Adriana",Amison,"A 48-year-old male with treated hypothyroidism presented with a long-standing history of depression that had been refractory to treatment. A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed atrophy in the frontal regions. This finding is significant because the patient has no known history of traumatic brain injury, inhalant or alcohol abuse, or prolonged exposure to gasoline. On the basis of the results of the brain imaging in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and neuropsychological testing, frontotemporal dementia was considered in the diagnosis and was thought to explain his chronic symptoms of apathy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy was implemented, with resolution of the patient's depressed mood and neurovegetative symptoms of depression as well as improvement in his Mini Mental Status Examination scores.",{},,The journal of ECT,10.1097/01.yct.0000161419.02503.fd,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
