32735814,Grip Constancy but Not Perceptual Size Constancy Survives Lesions of Early Visual Cortex.,"Whitwell, Robert L; Sperandio, Irene; Buckingham, Gavin; Chouinard, Philippe A; Goodale, Melvyn A",Whitwell,"Object constancies are central constructs in theories of visual phenomenology. A powerful example is ""size constancy,"" in which the perceived size of an object remains stable despite changes in viewing distance [1-4]. Evidence from neuropsychology [5], neuroimaging [6-11], transcranial magnetic stimulation [12, 13], single-unit and lesion studies in monkey [14-20], and computational modeling [21] suggests that re-entrant processes involving reciprocal interactions between primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate visual areas [22-26] play an essential role in mediating size constancy. It is seldom appreciated, however, that object constancies must also operate for the visual guidance of goal-directed action. For example, when reaching out to pick up an object, the hand's in-flight aperture scales with size of the goal object [27-30] and is refractory to the decrease in retinal-image size with increased viewing distance [31-41] (Figure 1), a phenomenon we call ""grip constancy."" Does grip constancy, like perceptual constancy, depend on V1 or can it be mediated by pathways that bypass it altogether? We tested these possibilities in an individual, M.C., who has bilateral lesions encompassing V1 and much of the ventral visual stream. We show that her perceptual estimates of object size co-vary with retinal-image size rather than real-world size as viewing distance varies. In contrast, M.C. shows near-normal scaling of in-flight grasp aperture to object size despite changes in viewing distance. Thus, although early visual cortex is necessary for perceptual object constancy, it is unnecessary for grip constancy, which is mediated instead by separate visual inputs to dorsal-stream visuomotor areas [42-48].","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Current biology : CB,10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.026,,V1; blindsight; dorsal stream; grasping; grip constancy; neuropsychology; object constancy; re-entrant processing; size constancy; ventral stream,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
34950010,Alice in Wonderland Syndrome-Like Seizure and Refractory Supraventricular Tachycardia.,"Panpruang, Pitirat; Wongwandee, Monton; Rattanajaruskul, Nattapun; Roongsangmanoon, Worawut; Wongsoasu, Arthit; Angkananard, Teeranan",Panpruang,"Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rarely curious visual perceptual disorder which has been associated with diverse neurologic and psychiatric problems. It may be a manifestation in migraine, epileptic seizures, encephalitis, other brain lesions, medication-related side effects, schizophrenia, and depressive disorders. Principal character of AIWS is the disproportion between the external world and the self-image in which micropsia (objects appear smaller), macropsia (objects appear larger), and teleopsia (objects appear further away) are frequently reported. The cases of temporal lobe epilepsy may present with complex visual auras of visual distortions (e.g., micropsia and macropsia) like AIWS. We report an unusual case of an elderly man who presented with AIWS, focal impaired awareness seizures, ictal tachyarrhythmia, multiple episodes of transient visual disturbances of macropsia and transient loss of consciousness. During those symptoms, telemetry showed self-limited supraventricular tachycardia several times which could not be regulated with heart rate-controlled medication. The electroencephalography was later tested and showed rhythmic theta activity over the right cerebral hemisphere. He was treated with levetiracetam, and all his symptoms and tachyarrhythmias were gradually resolved thereafter. Refractory response to treatment would remind the physicians to reassess for the correct diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000519509,PMC8647104,Alice in Wonderland; Macropsia; Seizure; Tachycardia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
19350271,The role of motor simulation in action perception: a neuropsychological case study.,"Eskenazi, Terry; Grosjean, Marc; Humphreys, Glyn W; Knoblich, Guenther",Eskenazi,"Research on embodied cognition stresses that bodily and motor processes constrain how we perceive others. Regarding action perception the most prominent hypothesis is that observed actions are matched to the observer's own motor representations. Previous findings demonstrate that the motor laws that constrain one's performance also constrain one's perception of others' actions. The present neuropsychological case study asked whether neurological impairments affect a person's performance and action perception in the same way. The results showed that patient DS, who suffers from a frontal brain lesion, not only ignored target size when performing movements but also when asked to judge whether others can perform the same movements. In other words DS showed the same violation of Fitts's law when performing and observing actions. These results further support the assumption of close perception action links and the assumption that these links recruit predictive mechanisms residing in the motor system.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Psychological research,10.1007/s00426-009-0231-5,PMC2694935,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
26275913,Impoverished descriptions of familiar routes in three cases of hippocampal/medial temporal lobe amnesia.,"Herdman, Katherine A; Calarco, Navona; Moscovitch, Morris; Hirshhorn, Marnie; Rosenbaum, R Shayna",Herdman,"Recent research has challenged classic theories of hippocampal function in spatial memory with findings that the hippocampus may be necessary for detailed representations of environments learned long ago, but not for remembering the gist or schematic aspects that are sufficient for navigating within those environments (Rosenbaum et al., 2000; Rosenbaum, Winocur, Binns, & Moscovitch, 2012). We aimed to probe further distinctions between detailed and schematic representations of familiar environments in three cases of hippocampal/medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia by testing them on a route description task and mental navigation tasks that assess the identity and location of landmarks, and distances and directions between them. The amnesic cases could describe basic directions along known, imagined routes, estimate distance and direction between well-known landmarks, and produce sketch maps with accurate layouts, suggestive of intact schematic representations. However, findings that their route descriptions lack richness of detail, along with impoverished sketch maps and poor landmark recognition, substantiates previous findings that detailed representations are hippocampus-dependent.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.06.008,,Case study method; Episodic memory; Hippocampus; Navigation; Spatial memory,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
19183969,Impaired distance perception and size constancy following bilateral occipitoparietal damage.,"Berryhill, Marian E; Fendrich, Robert; Olson, Ingrid R",Berryhill,"Accurate distance perception depends on the processing and integration of a variety of monocular and binocular cues. Dorsal stream lesions can impair this process, but details of this neurocognitive relationship remain unclear. Here, we tested a patient with bilateral occipitoparietal damage and severely impaired stereopsis. We addressed four related questions: (1) Can distance and size perception survive limitations in perceiving monocular and binocular cues? (2) Are egocentric (self-referential) and allocentric (object-referential) distance judgments similarly impaired? (3) Are distance measurements equally impaired in peripersonal and extrapersonal space? (4) Are size judgments possible when distance processing is impaired? The results demonstrate that the patient's lesions impaired both her distance and size perception, but not uniformly. Her performance when using an egocentric reference frame was more impaired than her performance when using an allocentric reference frame. Likewise, her distance judgments in peripersonal space were more impaired than those in extrapersonal space. The patient showed partial preservation in size processing of novel objects even when familiar size cues were removed.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-009-1707-7,PMC2728930,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Germany,eng
15156789,Acceleration perception and spatial distortion in a left unilateral neglect patient.,"Geminiani, Giuliano; Corazzini, Luca Latini; Stucchi, Natale; Gindri, Patrizia",Geminiani,"To explain relative leftward overextension in a line extension task by left unilateral neglect subjects, Bisiach et al. (1998) suggested that the representation of space is distorted--i.e., dilated towards the left side. If perception of the velocity of a moving stimulus is due to a calculation of the distance covered per unit time in representational space, then a stimulus with uniform linear motion should be perceived as decelerating when moving leftwards in the visual field of a subject with left unilateral neglect. We investigated the perception of acceleration in a patient with left unilateral neglect and spatial distortion (revealed as relative left overextension in a line extension task) using a task in which the stimuli were right and left moving targets with variable acceleration. The patient's ability to perceive acceleration was much lower (higher acceleration threshold) for leftward movements than rightward movements. Fourteen months later unilateral neglect had improved, and the relative left overextension and decreasing acceleration threshold for leftward movements were reduced. By contrast, alterations in the perception of acceleration for leftward movements were not found in a patient with left unilateral neglect and left underextension and in a patient with right brain damage and left hemianopia. These findings in one patient with left spatial unilateral neglect and a relative left overextension in a line extension task are consistent with the hypothesis that representational space is distorted, with a disproportionate leftward expansion, that affects perception of movement.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70126-6,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
3416614,How long is a piece of string? A study of line bisection in a case of visual neglect.,"Halligan, P W; Marshall, J C",Halligan,"We report a case of severe left visual neglect consequent upon extensive infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. A detailed analysis is given of the patient's performance on line bisection. The stimuli cover a wider range of lengths than is usually employed in such studies (11'' to 1''). The magnitude of the patient's rightward displacement of his transections is linearly related to the length of the stimulus line, such that the longer the line, the greater the left 'neglect'. At line length 2'', the patient's transections are relatively accurate, and at length 1'', the transections cross the objective midpoint to give a reliable left displacement (= 'right neglect'). On some occasions, these latter transections are placed beyond the leftmost point of the stimulus line. We interpret the data in terms of two constructs: (a) an 'attentional boundary' placed slightly to the left of the objective midline; (b) 'representational completion' that extends to the attentional boundary.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(88)80040-6,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
19458575,Perceptual distortion in homonymous paracentral scotomas.,"Mavrakanas, Nikolaos A; Dang-Burgener, Nathalie P L; Lorincz, Erika N; Landis, Theodor; Safran, Avinoam B",Mavrakanas,"Cortical remapping after peripheral or central visual deafferentation alters visual perception, but it is unclear whether such a phenomenon impinges on areas remote from a scotoma. To investigate this question, we studied variations of perceptual spatial distortion in the visual field of patients with homonymous paracentral scotoma. Two patients with right inferior homonymous paracentral scotoma were asked to describe their perception of a series of figures showing two isometric vertical lines symmetrically located on either side of a fixation point. In each figure, the fixation point varied by steps of 2 degrees along a hypothetical vertical line equidistant between the test lines. The lines subtended 20 degrees of visual angle, and the right line passed through the scotoma in both cases. Time for spatial distortion to manifest was recorded. Both subjects reported that the right line was perceived as shorter than the left one. The line shortening varied in magnitude with the distance of the fixation point from the end of the line and was more pronounced when the distance increased. Moreover, perceptual line shortening appeared 5-10 seconds after steady fixation, but values of shortening varied during the following 10 seconds. In addition, the right line appeared uninterrupted or slightly blurred in the scotoma region. These observations reflect long-range cortical reorganization after brain damage. Larger receptive fields in the periphery of the visual map could explain why perceptual shortening is more pronounced with increased eccentricity.",{},,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0b013e318198ca37,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
8818151,Focal and global attention modulate the expression of visuo-spatial neglect: a case study.,"Halligan, P W; Marshall, J C",Halligan,"We report a case of severe left visuo-spatial neglect consequent upon right-hemisphere stroke. In Experiment 1, we show that while the patient bisects lines significantly to the right of true centre, he is extremely accurate in placing a mark at the centre of an equivalent outlined square. Experiment 2 confirms that the lateral and radial accuracy obtained in the latter (square) task cannot be predicted from the lateral and radial displacements found in horizontal and vertical (radial) line bisection; the experiment also shows that the individual horizontal lines of a square can be bisected significantly more accurately than the same lines presented individually. Experiment 3 shows that the crucial figural component requisite for the accurate estimation of lateral extent is a large vertical (radial) line in right space. The obtained figural modulation of neglect is consistent with the model in which a large, unitary stimulus in right space engages and enhances the lesioned right hemisphere's intrinsic capacity to deploy global attention.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)90065-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

12465666,"Multiple reference frames in neglect? An investigation of the object-centred frame and the dissociation between ""near"" and ""far"" from the body by use of a mirror.","Laeng, Bruno; Brennen, Tim; Johannessen, Kristin; Holmen, Kirsti; Elvestad, Rolf",Laeng,"In this single case study of a man (AE) who suffered a right hemisphere stroke we showed the co-existence of neglect within different spatial frames: (a) In left hemispace and (b) in 'far' versus 'near' space, both as defined from the patient's viewpoint, as well as (c) for the left side of an object (as defined from an object-centred view). In the experiment, AE's latencies to name the colour of two cubes, each located in one hemispace, were measured. In some conditions, the cubes were placed on a table but in other conditions each cube was held in one hand of an experimenter who could either face the patient or show the cubes while her back was turned towards him. One prediction was that AE would show longer latencies for cubes in left hemispace; however, if object-centred neglect also occurred, then latencies should be even longer for cubes held in the experimenter's left hand. In order to reveal the presence of neglect for 'far' versus 'near' space, the cubes could also be positioned either near to (i.e. reaching distance) or far from the patient (i.e., several metres out of reach), by moving the table or the experimenter. Finally, in some conditions, AE looked at the cubes into a mirror that was positioned far away from his body. Because external objects seen in a mirror can be 'near' the patient's body, the patient actually looked at a 'far' location (i.e. the surface of the mirror) to see an object that is 'near'. The experiment confirmed the presence of all forms of neglect, since AE not only named the colour of a cube seen in his left hemispace more slowly than in right hemispace, but latencies increased for a cube held by the experimenter in her left hand and in left hemispace (both when the left hand was seen directly or as a mirror reflection). Finally, AE's performance was worse for 'far' than 'near' locations, when the cubes were physically located near his body (i.e., within ""grasping"" space) but seen in the mirror.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70020-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
10606008,Brain imaging in a patient with hemimicropsia.,"Kassubek, J; Otte, M; Wolter, T; Greenlee, M W; Mergner, T; Lücking, C H",Kassubek,"Hemimicropsia is an isolated misperception of the size of objects in one hemifield (objects appear smaller) which is, as a phenomenon of central origin, very infrequently reported in literature. We present a case of hemimicropsia as a selective deficit of size and distance perception in the left hemifield without hemianopsia caused by a cavernous angioma with hemorrhage in the right occipitotemporal area. The symptom occurred only intermittently and was considered the consequence of a local irritation by the hemorrhage. Imaging data including a volume-rendering MR data set of the patient's brain were transformed to the 3-D stereotactic grid system by Talairach and warped to a novel digital 3-D brain atlas. Imaging analysis included functional MRI (fMRI) to analyse the patient's visual cortex areas (mainly V5) in relation to the localization of the hemangioma to establish physiological landmarks with respect to visual stimulation. The lesion was localized in the peripheral visual association cortex, Brodmann area (BA) 19, adjacent to BA 37, both of which are part of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. Additional psychophysical measurements revealed an elevated threshold for perceiving coherent motion, which we relate to a partial loss of function in V5, a region adjacent to the cavernoma. In our study, we localized for the first time a cerebral lesion causing micropsia by digital mapping in Talairach space using a 3-D brain atlas and topologically related it to fMRI data for visual motion. The localization of the brain lesion affecting BA 19 and the occipitotemporal visual pathway is discussed with respect to experimental and case report findings about the neural basis of object size perception.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00041-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The predictions are then tested in three sets of experiments that manipulate focal and panoramic attention in estimations of the midpoints of lines and outline squares.

8043269,The psychophysical power law and unilateral spatial neglect.,"Chatterjee, A; Mennemeier, M; Heilman, K M",Chatterjee,"The relationship between objective measures and subjective experiences of sensory stimuli is described by a power law, psi = K phi beta, in which psi represents the psychological value and phi the physical value. The constant (K) and the exponent (beta) are empirically derived. This relationship is often assumed to correspond to properties of peripheral receptor sensory transduction. Patients with left-sided spatial neglect tend to bisect lines to the right of the objective midline. Line bisection bias was used as the dependent variable in how a patient with neglect and five normal subjects bisected lines of varying lengths. Analyzing these data as a power function accounted for over 99% of the variance in five different experimental conditions. The normal exponent matched the value expected from traditional psychophysical experiments of line length estimation, whereas the patient's exponent was diminished. The patient's data provide evidence for central nervous system participation in computations underlying psychophysical relationships. The notion that attentional and perceptual processes are closely linked was supported by the influence of attentional cuing on the power functions obtained in normal subjects. The descriptive precision of the power function uncovered qualitative variability in how normal subjects allocate attention across different spatial reference frames and demonstrated that this patient had a quantitative defect in directing attention across an allosteric reference frame, but a qualitative defect in directing attention across a viewer/environment reference frame.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1994.1025,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

The patient described in the present study was admitted to hospital after sudden onset of a left hemiparesis. The lesion at CT scan was located in the posterior limb of the right internal capsule. Neuropsychological assessment was normal except for the presence of a major topographical disorientation and of mnestic disturbances for visuo-spatial material leading us to attribute topographical disorientation to a specific loss of topographical memory. Regional cerebral blood flow measurements disclosed a right parietal hypoperfusion.
