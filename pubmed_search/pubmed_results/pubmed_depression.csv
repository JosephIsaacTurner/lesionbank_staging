16542786,Rapid recovery from major depression using magnesium treatment.,"Eby, George A; Eby, Karen L",Eby,"Major depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sense of inadequacy, despondency, decreased activity, pessimism, anhedonia and sadness where these symptoms severely disrupt and adversely affect the person's life, sometimes to such an extent that suicide is attempted or results. Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.047,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Strokes are often associated with psychiatric symptoms, particularly depressive and, more rarely, manic. We herein report a case of bipolar disorder secondary to cerebrovascular disease in a 67-year-old man with no personal or family history of psychiatric illness who, at the age of 64, had a bilateral ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. About 20 days after this stroke, he experienced a manic episode. Three years later, he experienced a second manic episode, with another hospitalization in a psychiatric ward. With this case, we intend to emphasize that, although rare, the diagnosis of mania after stroke should not be forgotten, and most important, one should be aware of the recurrence of affective episodes just as in non-medical-caused bipolar disorder.",{},,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,10.1097/NMD.0000000000001410,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

29128127,A crossbow suicide.,"Panata, Laura; Lancia, Massimo; Persichini, Alessandra; Scalise Pantuso, Sergio; Bacci, Mauro",Panata,"The crossbow is an ancient ranged weapon originally conceived for war and hunting. Although nowadays its use in warfare has been surpassed by firearms, it continues to be used in hunting, sports and recreation. The authors present the case of a 40-year-old man who suffered from severe depression. When his condition further deteriorated, doctors ordered a forced hospitalization but, just a few hours before the measure became effective, the man committed suicide using a crossbow. The autopsy and police investigation showed possession of the crossbow darts which the man used to shoot himself in the head. The forensic pathologist found the dart stuck in the skull: the entry wound was in the suprahyoid region while the arrow tip emerged in the left parietal region meaning the arrow crossed the tongue, the middle fossa, the brain and the cranial wall. All the wounds presented a three-pointed star shape consistent with the three sharp blades of the dart. An extensive blood infiltration affected the subdural and subarachnoid space, particularly where the dart had passed. The severe brain injury, extensive subdural and subarachnoid bleeding and brain swelling following the trauma caused the death. Even though the use of the crossbow is only permitted in sporting/hunting contexts, the reported case highlights the sharp contrast between its potential for harm and the easy access to this kind of weapon, even for those affected by mental illness.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Forensic science international,10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.10.019,,Autopsy; Crossbow; Forensic pathology; Illegal dart; Intracranial injury; Suicide,Case Reports; Journal Article,Ireland,eng

However, it is frequently missed in cases involving the cerebellum, resulting in a lack of treatment, which can directly impact stroke rehabilitation. A 63-year-old Caucasian female with no history of mood disorders presented with gait instability, dysarthria, and right sided hemiplegia, secondary to cerebellar and pontine ischemic stroke from a basilar occlusion. She underwent endovascular therapy and her deficits gradually improved. However during recovery she began to develop uncontrollable tearfulness while retaining insight that her emotional expression was contextually inappropriate. She was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported improvements in her emotional regulation at one year follow up. This case highlights cerebellar injury as a potential cause of poorly regulated emotions, or an emotional dysmetria. The recognition of this disorder in patients with cerebellar or pontine strokes is critical, as untreated pseudobulbar affect can impact future stroke rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04294-1,PMC10722665,Case report; Cerebellum; Depression; Emotional lability; Ischemic stroke; Pseudobulbar affect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
19204849,The effects of epilepsy and its treatments on affect and emotion.,"Hixson, John D; Kirsch, Heidi E",Hixson,"Epilepsy creates significant morbidity, disability, and loss of productivity worldwide. Although unpredictable seizures define epilepsy, the cognitive and emotional difficulties encountered by people with epilepsy may have an even greater impact on everyday function. Epilepsy is associated with lower quality of life (QOL); while this is partially attributable to ongoing seizures, QOL is independently affected by comorbid affective disorders like depression and anxiety. These can accompany all types of epilepsy, but may be especially noteworthy in partial epilepsy syndromes with foci in the frontal or temporal lobes. There is growing evidence that epileptogenic lesions disrupt cortical networks that carry out emotional processing. In addition to epilepsy itself, treatment strategies also affect cognitive functioning and mood. Antiepileptic drugs, vagal nerve stimulation, and surgical resection have all been associated with changes in mood, emotional processing, and social cognition. Overall, the relationship between epilepsy and emotion is vastly complex; when assessing emotional difficulties in a person with epilepsy, we must consider the psychosocial impact of the disease on the patient, the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, and the effects of ongoing treatments.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802632876,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

This is particularly notable in those with preexisting cerebrovascular disease, which impacts dynamic cerebral autoregulation. In these patients, the increased blood flow to the seizing portions of the brain induced by ECT potentially can reduce cerebral blood flow to ischemic areas, possibly causing adverse neurological events. The authors describe a patient with chronic cerebral ischemic disease, chronic anemia, and major depressive disorder undergoing ECT to achieve remission. The patient developed recurrent focal neurological deficits after each ECT procedure, with neurological recovery within 48 hours post-ECT. Clinical guidelines may need to be updated for the management of ECT patients with cerebrovascular disease who may be at an increased risk of intraictal and possibly postictal regional ischemia, especially in areas already compromised by a prior stroke and/or by reduced cerebral oxygenation caused by symptomatic anemia at risk of ischemia.

Bilateral hippocampal lesions lead to persistent anterograde amnesia while unilateral damage results in milder, content-specific forms of amnesia. Hippocampus may be affected by an acute or chronic pathologic process from a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. A 61-year-old female patient with a long history of hypertension, glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia and depression was hospitalized for acute anterograde amnesia, which led to repeated excessive drug taking. By further examinations that included laboratory tests, electroencephalography, Doppler sonography of intra- and extracranial vessels and neurovisualization methods [multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain] bilateral hippocampal ischemia that occurred at different times was detected. Cognitive and neuropsychological evaluation revealed an isolated severe damage of episodic memory with the inability of retention of new information which persisted at the control examination three months later. The assumed mechanism of occurrence of ischemia in this case could be arterioarterial embolism. Although ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases, ischemic stroke of the hippocampus is rare, the isolated bilateral presentation with clinical signs of severe amnestic syndrome in particular. Timely recognition and modern therapeutic approach could have a favorable impact on the recovery from severe neurological, cognitive deficit. It could be suggested that in patients with the clinical image of acute anterograde amnesia and vascular risk factors the MSCT examination of the brain with computed tomography perfusion and angiography is performed immediately upon hospitalization.",{},,Vojnosanitetski pregled,10.2298/vsp140330015k,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Serbia,eng

It has the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric disorders. Recent research indicates that malnutrition in AN patients induces various kinds of functional brain damage, but the pathophysiology of AN remains unclear. We report here the neuropathological findings of a 31-year-old Japanese woman. At age 24, she had a fear of gaining weight and reduced her dietary intake; she had extremely low body weight associated with overeating then self-induced vomiting. She was clinically diagnosed as having AN and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. At age 31, she died despite intensive physical care and psychotherapy. Neuropathological examination revealed increased capillary blood vessels and slight fibrillary gliosis in the mammillary bodies, with similarities to Wernicke encephalopathy. The brainstem exhibited the characteristic features of central pontine myelinolysis, characterized by a sharply demarcated region of myelin pallor and relative sparing of axons. Senile changes, including neurofibrillary tangles/senile plaques, were not significant. Severe fibrillary gliosis was prominent around periventricular regions, including the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, which are associated with cognition, emotion, and emotional behaviors via the dopaminergic pathways. These findings indicate that prolonged malnutrition in AN patients may induce brain damage, leading to dysfunction of the reward-related dopaminergic pathways. Furthermore, they represent the first pathological evidence that dysfunction of the cortico-limbic-striatal circuitry is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric symptoms in AN patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12711,,Wernicke encephalopathy; anorexia nervosa; gliosis; neuropathology; nucleus accumbens,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Endolymphatic sac tumor (ELST) is a rare neoplasm involving the middle and inner ear described in humans and dogs that does not show cellular characteristics of malignancy, but can be locally invasive and involve destruction of the temporal bone and adjacent structures. An 8-month-old female cat was referred because of sudden onset of vestibular signs starting 3 days prior to referral. On clinical examination, the patient showed depression, right head tilt, left-sided facial paralysis, and horizontal nystagmus with fast phase to the left. The magnetic resonance images showed a voluminous extra-axial lesion, with irregular morphology and well-defined margins, with intracranial extension in the region of the pons, rostral medulla oblongata, cerebellar vermis, floccule, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Due to progressive clinical deterioration, the cat was euthanized 2 weeks later. A necropsy was then performed and histological samples were taken. The necropsy revealed the presence of a voluminous dark red irregular mass extending from the tympanic bulla to the posterior cranial fossa following the left glossopharyngeal nerve. The histopathological exam of the extra-axial lesion featured a nonencapsulated, moderately cellular, rather loose, proliferation of cuboidal to columnar epithelium breaching through chunks of an otherwise normal appearing dura mater and invading some cranial nerves. Sections of the cerebellum and brainstem revealed moderate, focal, impingement of the parenchyma with a very mild extension of the proliferating cells into the ventral left side of the medulla oblongata.

The cultural components play an imperative role in explaining certain psychiatric symptoms and can guide treatment. With the growing population of immigrants coming to the United States, many of which require treatment for mental illness, it is essential that clinicians be cognizant in incorporating cultural perspectives when treating such patients. The authors describe the case of a 24-year old South Asian male who suffered an exacerbation of a depressive syndrome after a traumatic brain injury. Using a biopsychosocial cultural approach, this case highlights how South Asian cultural values can contribute to and incite psychiatric symptoms while simultaneously providing protective drivers for treatment outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Asian journal of psychiatry,10.1016/j.ajp.2014.10.001,,Biopsychosocial model; Brain injury; Cultural perspectives; Depression,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng

In these cases, an organic affective disorder can be diagnosed. The authors present the case of a 59-year-old male patient who developed a severe depressive episode over approximately 6 months and was, therefore, admitted to the hospital. In retrospect, he reported that, at age 39, he suffered from self-limiting sensory disturbances and muscle weakness in both legs. The current magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed several conspicuous FLAIR-hyperintense supratentorial white matter lesions compatible with chronic inflammatory brain disease. Imaging of the spinal axis revealed no clear spinal lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses showed CSF-specific oligoclonal bands. Therefore, multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. Further CSF analyses, using tissue-based assays with indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain tissue, revealed a (peri-)nuclear signal and a strong neuritic signal of many neurons, especially on granule cells in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, as well as in the corpus callosum. Additionally, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers of 1:12,800 and a lymphopenia were detected in blood tests. Further system clarification showed no suspicion of rheumatic or oncological disease. Anti-inflammatory treatment led to rapid and sustained improvement. The present patient suffered from a probable ""autoimmune depression"" in the context of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis with typical MRI and CSF pathologies, alongside mild concomitant latent systemic autoimmune process (with high-titer ANAs and lymphopenia) and unknown antineuronal antibodies. The case report illustrates that a depressive syndrome suggestive of primary idiopathic depressive disorder may be associated with an autoimmune brain involvement. The detection of such organic affective disorders is of high clinical relevance for affected patients, as it enables alternative and more causal treatment approaches.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00745,PMC7457046,autoantibody; autoimmune encephalitis; connective tissue disease; depression; multiple sclerosis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This association is noteworthy since MS may worsen during the postpartum period and melatonin secretion is reported to be altered most dramatically by pregnancy and delivery.

This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS. When finding atypical symptoms, a more in-depth evaluation should be made to allow optimization of the diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/s12888-021-03360-6,PMC8296673,Brain tumor; Case report; Charles-bonnet syndrome; Meningioma; Visual hallucinations,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Home care, community setting. A case study of an older adult with traumatic brain injury (TBI) secondary to a fall who had significant allostatic load at the time of his injury. ""Allostatic load"" is a theoretical construct that suggests the brain is experiencing chronic strain on its systems that flexibly respond to stressors. Sustained allostatic load can contribute to chronic conditions and poor outcomes. Through actions with the family as caregivers, the case manager was able to coordinate a structured home setting and gradual resumption of social activities for this older adult. Focus was on establishing structure, meaningful social interactions, and positive home experiences that maximized the older adult's interests and capacity and mitigated chronic stress. Gradually, the older adult returned to his preinjury capacity and lives independently within the family home. The case management process has the potential to mitigate stressors and improve depression management through family-focused care. Although there is limited guidance on prevention of depression, this approach resulted in attainment of safe home care, no hospital readmissions, and return to previous lifestyle for the older adult.

Injury to the frontal lobe can result in disinhibition and aggression which can result in police intervention and/or incarceration. We highlight four adult cases with a history of severe TBI with frontal lobe injuries and the presence of post-TBI criminal behaviors. There is evidence to support an anatomical basis for aggressive behaviors, yet there are other risk factors to be considered. Behaviors must be investigated thoroughly by obtaining adequate pre- and post-TBI psychiatric and psychosocial histories. By having a comprehensive understanding of aggression while appreciating the complex relationship between TBI, aggression, and premorbid risk factors, clinicians can more adequately treat patients with TBI, with the aim of potentially preventing criminal behaviors and recidivism.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of forensic sciences,10.1111/1556-4029.13289,,aggression; forensic science; frontal lobe; incarceration; recidivism; risk factors; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng

Here, we illustrate a strategy to combine individual subject-level lesion information with open-source normative functional-connectomics data to make putative, neuroscience-informed symptom interpretation. Specifically, we report a patient with left precuneus granulomatous lesion and seizures followed by two distinct symptoms - kinetopsia and delusions of nihilism and guilt - which had a differential treatment response. The lesion-based brain-mapping approach could identify correlated (default-mode) and anti-correlated (temporo-parieto-occipital) networks, which enabled a neurobiological formulation of these diverse clinical manifestations.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Asian journal of psychiatry,10.1016/j.ajp.2018.12.018,,Kinetopsia; Nihilism; Precuneus; Resting state fMRI; Seizures,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
7711357,Treatment of uncontrolled crying after stroke.,"Andersen, G",Andersen,"Uncontrolled crying after stroke is a disturbance of the motor concomitants of emotional affect. It manifests as stereotyped outbursts of crying that are excessive to an appropriate emotional response. The episodes can be triggered by almost any kind of emotional stimulus (happiness, excitement, sadness, just being looked at or talked to, the sight of a doctor, etc.) and can even occur without any obvious external or internal stimulus. The condition is socially embarrassing, and in the most severely affected patients the crying episodes can be so violent that they interfere with rehabilitation. Although frequent (1-year incidence is 20%), the condition often goes unrecognised because patients and relatives rarely complain about it spontaneously. Effective treatment has now been documented in 3 controlled studies of tricyclic antidepressants and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. There seems to be a rationale for the latter approach to treatment, in that post-stroke pathological crying may be attributable to stroke-induced partial destruction of the serotonergic raphe nuclei in the brainstem or their ascending projections to the hemispheres. Although our knowledge of the aetiology and treatment of the condition is limited, and the need for further study is considerable, the present treatment possibilities can significantly improve quality of life for patients with this socially embarrassing and sometimes debilitating condition.",{},,Drugs & aging,10.2165/00002512-199506020-00003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,New Zealand,eng
32754407,"A Rare Case of a Large, Deceitfully Quiet Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformation Presenting Only as Dizziness.","Rao, Swathi; Giron, Fanny",Rao,"Dizziness is one of the most frequent complaints encountered in the medical practice affecting 15%-20% of adults yearly, and can be challenging to assess. Most patients use dizziness as a non-specific term, and thus suffer prejudice from the physicians' end and can be disregarded frequently. Dizziness can be a symptom of various diseases, some with sinister pathologies. We present a case of garden-variety vertigo that unfurled to be not-so-simple, emphasizing the importance of a thorough history and physical examination again even in the era of technology. A 32-year-old male patient with no past medical history presented with dizziness, later clarified as gradually progressive vertigo for two years, with unstable gait, dysarthria, and occasional diplopia. Physical examination found sustained nystagmus that changed direction with horizontal gaze, vertical nystagmus with upward gaze, dysarthria, and a wide-based ataxic gait. CT head without contrast revealed indeterminate hypodense areas in the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellar hemisphere. MRI brain identified a 2.8 x 3.4 x 4.2 cm Spetzler-Martin grade IV brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. Feeders were mostly from the posterior circulation, with three intranidal aneurysms, all draining into the deep venous system. The AVM was deemed inoperable, and the patient was treated with onyx embolization for two/three feeding vessel aneurysms. After treatment, the symptoms persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) six months after diagnosis, and was admitted a year later with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder. Brain AVMs are rare clinical entities that present in 0.1% of the population, mostly presenting as intracranial bleeds. When they do rarely present with isolated focal neurologic deficits, it has been attributed to a vascular steal phenomenon, hemorrhage, or a mass effect. The isolated findings of vertigo and dysarthria are highly non-specific; with such presentation, clinicians should consider etiologies under the realm of vertigo of central origin. An untreatable AVM reduces patients' quality of life and has been linked to depression and anxiety, and thus patients may benefit from psychosocial therapy. Although preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary concern with brain AVMs, the rest of the patient's profile should not be forgotten.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.8870,PMC7387078,arteriovenous malformation; dizziness; nystagmus; vertigo,Case Reports,United States,eng

Stroke patients who develop depression have slower recovery, greater disability, and higher mortality rates. The pathophysiology of post-stroke depression is not yet clearly defined, but studies suggest contributions from both psychosocial factors and stroke-related factors, such as lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits. Early treatment has a positive impact on post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and survival. We present the case of an 82-year-old man with no psychiatric history who was brought to the psychiatric emergency department after two suicide attempts in the span of 7 days. He was severely depressed, with feelings of hopelessness, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. He had suffered a stroke the week before, affecting the anterior portion of the left cingulate gyrus, causing right hemiparesis and paresthesia. The psychiatric symptoms developed immediately after the stroke and were not present before the event. He was admitted to the psychiatry ward, treated with sertraline 100 mg/day and quetiapine 50 mg/day and discharged within 28 days, after full remission of symptoms. Our case strengthens the association between lesions located to the frontal-subcortical circuits and post-stroke depression.

However, few studies have examined the efficacy of specific intervention strategies to reduce the frequency and intensity of anger outbursts. We therefore performed a single-case study on this topic by administering two successive and complementary psychological interventions with an AB design with maintenance (first intervention) and an AC design with maintenance plus a one-month follow-up (second intervention) to a patient with a severe TBI. Whereas the first intervention focused on improving the recognition and expression of basic emotions, the second consisted of a self-regulation programme, including various features such as psychoeducation about self-control strategies, relaxation and assertiveness training that aimed to establish adequate behaviours, which were further promoted by an implementation intentions strategy in the patient's daily life. The results indicated that all interventions resulted in a reduced frequency and intensity of anger outbursts, and the data upheld the specificity of these effects. In addition, a meta-analytic integration of the effects of both interventions on the outcomes indicated a medium effect size. Further research is needed on other patients who experience long-standing anger outbursts to examine whether the observed gains can be replicated, sustained on a longer-term basis and improved.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2016.1270837,,Traumatic brain injury; anger; emotion recognition; implementation intentions; single-case,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A case is presented of a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in a manic state 15 years after having suffered a closed head injury. Several psychiatric admissions during the past 2 years were noted, with various diagnoses including different iterations of bipolar disorder. Among his medications, levodopa-carbidopa was present for an unsubstantiated Parkinson disease diagnosis. His mania resolved after discontinuation of the agent. This case is presented with a review of the relevant literature pertaining to the use of levodopa-carbidopa in this context, the use of other dopaminergic agents, and a biological hypothesis for the potential increased likelihood of manic symptoms in TBI patients who receive levodopa-carbidopa. Currently, there is a lack of research in this area, which emphasizes a need to review treatment guidelines for Parkinson disease patients with TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The primary care companion for CNS disorders,10.4088/PCC.18br02379,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A case report and considerations.,"Aragona, B; De Luca, R; Piccolo, A; Le Cause, M; Destro, M; Casella, C; Filoni, S; Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore",Aragona,"Post-stroke apathy is considered to be one of the clinical consequences of lesions affecting the structures of the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus and limbic system. However, there is no current consensus on the treatment of post-stroke apathy, which mainly depends on the underlying etiology and comorbidities. A 62-year-old man, affected by hemorrhagic stroke in the left thalamus, presented with mood depression, anhedonia, hyporexia and marked apathy. The patient underwent clinical evaluation before and after receiving two different pharmacological therapies: escitalopram and bupropion. Only after treatment with the latter drug did the patient show changes: high motivation and willingness to pursue activities, greater interest in the external environment and social life activities, and an overall reduction of apathy. On the basis of our observations in this case, we hypothesize that the thalamic lesion resulted in disconnection of the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits, and that loss of the dopaminergic striatal innervation caused the patient's apathetic state. The resolution of the apathetic disorder may be attributable to the action of the dopaminergic drug bupropion on the mesocortical pathway.",{},,Functional neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.195,,Central post-stroke pain; Intermittent stimulation; Spinal cord stimulation; Thalamic pain,Case Reports,United States,eng

Although a contralesional release phenomenon has been implicated in post-stroke mania, empirical findings are lacking. We present a case report of post stroke mania. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was performed twice, during the manic state and during the remitted euthymic state. The first SPECT study performed during the manic state demonstrated hypoperfusion in the right temporal and frontal regions due to right putaminal hemorrhage. It also showed hyperperfusion in the inferior lateral prefrontal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the medial and lateral parts of the parietal lobe in the left hemisphere. The second SPECT study performed during the euthymic state demonstrated moderate improvement in the hypoperfusion in the right fronto-temporal regions. Furthermore, compared to the findings on the first SPECT study, the second study showed that the focal hyperperfusion in the anterior insular cortex, inferior lateral prefrontal lobes, and superior-middle temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere had vanished. Increased left inferior prefrontal and anterior insular activity and reduced extensive right fronto-temporal lobe activity are involved in the development of post-stroke mania.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-12-68,PMC3482600,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here we performed multi-modal cerebral monitoring to investigate pathologies associated with CSD occurrence in a case of severe traumatic brain injury. A 20 years old male suffering severe traumatic brain injury from a fall had extensive frontal subdural and intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect. Craniectomy was performed for hematoma evacuation and decompression. During surgery, a subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) electrode strip, along with microdialysis and PtiO2 probes, was placed beside injured cortex for CSD monitoring. Within 13-81 hours post-injury, 34 CSD occurred. CSD incidence increased during spontaneous hyperthermia and decreased during induced normothermia. Periods of CSD activity were also associated with low brain glucose (<0.10 mmol/l), elevated glutamate (>40 mmol/l) and lactate/pyruvate (>40), and PtiO2<10 mmHg. CSD caused progressive deterioration of ECoG activity only in regions with infarction at follow-up on day 27. Repetitive mass tissue depolarizations accompanied a negative course of hemorrhagic lesion progression in the presence of ischemic conditions after traumatic brain injury. Whether as cause or effect, CSD may represent an inherent component of progressive metabolic failure leading to tissue death, and temperature appears to be an important factor influencing their occurrence. Continuous ECoG is a valuable tool for monitoring subclinical events such as CSD and seizures and for translational research in acute brain injury mechanisms and therapeutics.",{},,Neurological research,10.1179/174313208X309739,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng
23895312,Self-inflicted trans-oral intracranial stab wound.,"Kim, Seong Woo; Kim, Jong Hun; Han, Zee-A",Kim,"Intracranial stab wounds are low-velocity, penetrating injuries to the brain and fatality and outcome significantly depend on route, depth and location of cranial penetration. Due to the effective barrier provided by the adult calvarium, most injuries occur through the orbitae or temporal regions where bony layers are thin. Self-inflicted intracranial stab wounds are an even rarer form of traumatic brain injury, with common entry points being the orbital space and the nose. Intracranial brainstem injuries mostly result in death, with reported penetration areas being the pons or midbrain. The following report reviews a first reported case of self-inflicted intracranial stabbing via a trans-oral route with lesions to the medulla oblongata and cerebellum. Unlike previous cases of low velocity penetrating injuries to the brainstem, the patient underwent full neurologic recovery after manual knife removal and intensive rehabilitation.

This was a single-center, randomized, two-armed, controlled trial. Eighty-four patients with PSD were selected and randomly assigned to a Tuina therapy group or a routine rehabilitation control group. The patients underwent five 20-min treatment sessions per week over a period of 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score over the 2 weeks of intervention, whereas the secondary outcome measures were changes in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score, Modified Barthel index (MBI), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. The Tuina group showed significantly improved HAMD scores compared to the routine rehabilitation control group (5.85, [2.54, 9.16]). For the secondary outcomes, the Tuina group showed better MMSE scores than the routine rehabilitation group (1.97, [1.19, 2.76]); however, there were no significant differences between the other secondary outcomes of both groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). After 2 weeks, both groups showed a significant decrease in HAMD score compared to baseline. In addition, the Tuina group showed a significant decrease in MMSE score compared to baseline (2.35, [1.8, 2.9]); however, there were no significant differences in the MBI and FMA scores of the two group after the intervention (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Regarding fMRI results, the zALFF values of the right caudate nucleus, right putamen, right insula, left superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, right hippocampus, left middle temporal gyrus, left angular gyrus, and left thalamus were higher in the Tuina group. In the Tuina group, the functional connectivity between the hippocampus and thalamus, and the thalamus and caudate nucleus, were significantly different (<i>P</i> <0.01). In addition, the zALFF value of the hippocampus was significantly negatively correlated with HAMD score. No serious adverse events were observed in both groups. Tuina therapy administered 10 times within 2 weeks is safe and can effectively relieve depression and improve cognitive function in patients with PSD. This finding may be closely related to the effect of Tuina therapy on the activation and functional connectivity of the hippocampus. http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=55151, identifier ChiCTR200003388.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.923721,PMC9281445,Tuina; cognitive function; functional magnetic resonance imaging; post-stroke depression; traditional Chinese medicine,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

On PD 5, she had a generalized seizure, leading to endotracheal intubation, propofol infusion, and transfer to our institution. By PD 6, she opened her eyes to voice, followed commands, moved all extremities, and had briskly reactive 4 mm pupils. MRI showed L parasagittal ICH with minimal mass effect, edema consistent with PRES, and brain descent with obliteration of the basal cisterns and tonsillar herniation. Later on PD 6, after diuresis for pulmonary edema, she became unresponsive with a dilated and nonreactive left pupil. She was laid flat for transport to CT, with improvement in arousal and pupil reactivity within 5 min. Intravascular volume was repleted with normal saline and albumin, and she was placed in the Trendelenburg position.

Here, we demonstrate our technique encompassing multi-modal imaging guidance and awake brain mapping which enables maximum safe resection of such tumors. The patient, a 39-yr-old man, presented with depression and memory loss for 18 mo. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens) revealed a nonenhancing lesion in the left dominant temporoinsular lobe. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyze the choline/N-acetyl-aspartate index which suggested a low-grade glioma diagnosis. Informed patient consent was obtained. After craniotomy, the mouth motor, speech arrest, and word generation areas were mapped via direct cortical stimulation under awake mapping. A strip electrode was placed across the precentral gyrus for continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. Cortical incisions were made in nonfunctional cortical areas and tumor was resected in the temporal lobe. Following this, tumor at the inferior insular zone was carefully debunked with Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (Integra Lifescience) also through the temporal window. The hippocampus was preserved since it was not invaded by tumor. Subcortical mapping combined with Diffuse Tensor Imaging tractography-based navigation (Medtronic lnc.) was performed to localize the motor and language pathways. Intraoperative MRI evaluation showed tumor resection extent of 95%. Pathological and molecular analysis revealed a diagnosis of Grade II IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma.

33530222,Degeneration of core neural tracts for emotional regulation in a patient with traumatic brain injury: A case report.,"Choi, Eun Bi; Jang, Sung Ho",Choi,"Several brain structures, including the orbital prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex, are considered key structures in the neural circuitry underlying emotion regulation. We report on a patient showing behavior changes and degeneration of core neural tracts for emotional regulation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 51-year-old male patient suffered an in-car accident. The patient lost consciousness for approximately 30 days, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3. He underwent stereotactic drainage for traumatic intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhages. At approximately 6.5-year after onset, he began to show disinhibition behaviors such as shouting with anger, which worsened over time. At approximately 8-year after onset, he showed severe depression signs and disinhibition, including violence. The patient who showed delayed-onset behavioral changes (disinhibition and depression). Diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired at 3 months and 8 years after TBI onset. The patient showed degeneration of core neural tracts for emotional regulation that was associated with delayed behavioral changes following TBI. On both 3-month and 8-year diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs), the right dorsolateral prefronto-thalamic tract, ventrolateral prefronto-thalamic tract, orbital prefronto-thalamic tract, uncinate fasciculus, and both cinguli were reconstructed whereas other neural tracts were not reconstructed. Compared with the 3-month DTT, all reconstructed neural tracts on the 8-year DTT were narrow, except for the left cingulum, which showed new transcallosal fibers between both anterior cingula. The fractional anisotropy and tract volume of all reconstructed neural tracts were lower on the 8-year DTT than the 3-month DTT, except for the tract volume of left cingulum. The evaluation of dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and orbital prefronto-thalamic tract, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum using follow-up DTTs is useful when a patient with TBI shows delayed-onset behavioral problems.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000024319,PMC7850638,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Complete remission of persistent PMDD symptoms after surgical removal of a pituitary lesion has not been reported. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 44-year-old woman with childbearing potential who underwent transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) in December 2017 to remove a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. The surgery resulted in full remission of her PMDD symptoms. The patient's hormone levels remained stable before and after the TSS procedure. During 28 months of follow-up, the woman has been asymptomatic for periods of 6 consecutive months or longer without taking antidepressants. Given the patient's current condition, a durable remission from PMDD is anticipated. CONCLUSIONS We believe that refractory PMS/PMDD associated with pituitary lesions is under-diagnosed and under reported. As demonstrated in this case, surgical intervention for a sellar mass has the potential to be effective or even curative for patients with PMS/PMDD. We recommend that physicians consider magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in patients with PMS/PMDD.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.922797,PMC7440754,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

20309801,Outcome of craniocerebral gunshot injuries in the civilian population. Prognostic factors and treatment options.,"Petridis, A K; Doukas, A; Barth, H; Mehdorn, M",Petridis,"Gunshot wounds to the head are rare in Europe. They may be inflicted by low-velocity handguns, captive bolt guns and tear gas cartridges and mostly result from suicide attempts. The experience of neurosurgeons with this kind of traumatic injury is decreasing; the aim of this study was therefore to analyse prognostic factors which help to decide whether or not to operate and to discuss treatment options. Thirty patients with gunshot head injuries treated in our hospital from 1993 to 2008 were retrospectively evaluated. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, pupil reactivity, lesion localisation, number of bone fragments, intracranial pressure (ICP), midline shift, hypotension, and dural penetration were analysed for their prognostic value. Surgically and non-surgically treated patients were evaluated separately. Complications were registered. A low GCS of 3-8, fixed pupils, >2 bone fragments, bilobar or posterior fossa/brainstem lesions and ICP >45 mmHg were indicators of a poor prognosis. Patients with a GCS of 3-8 and two non-reactive pupils should not be operated. If one or both of the pupils are reactive, surgery should be performed irrespective of the GCS score, except in patients with translobar/transventricular wounds. Even if there are no clear contraindications to surgery, the outcome is expected to be poor in patients with a low GCS score, midline shift >10 mm, >2 bone fragments in the brain, and a bilobar, posterior fossa/brainstem or ventricular lesion and ICP >45 mmHg. When surgery is performed the wound and the missile or bone track should be debrided meticulously, the wound and dura should be closed in a watertight fashion and antibiotic prophylaxis as well as tetanus serum should be given.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Central European neurosurgery,10.1055/s-0029-1241850,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

This intervention was based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles and was shown feasible in a pilot study. In order to meet the specific needs of stroke patients (concerning both sensori-motor, cognitive, and behavioural problems), we incorporated motivational interviewing, grief resolution, and psycho-education. We emphasised for each session to take into account the cognitive deficits of the patients (i.e. be concrete, accessible, structured, specific, and repeat information). Moreover, we augmented the psychologist-administered therapy with the contribution of an occupational or movement therapist aimed at facilitating patients' goal-setting and attainment. The intervention consisted of 12 one-hour sessions with a psychologist and three or four one-hour sessions with an occupational or movement therapist. Currently, the effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. The proposed psychological treatment protocol is innovative, as it applies cognitive behavioural therapy in a stroke-specific manner; moreover, it supports goal attainment by incorporating occupational or movement therapy sessions.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Clinical rehabilitation,10.1177/0269215514559987,,Stroke; anxiety; cognitive behavioural therapy; depression; treatment protocol,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Studies have shown that there are a multitude of underlying issues, including mental illness, that elevate an individual's risk of dying by suicide ( CDC WONDER: Underlying cause of death, 1999-2019 . Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2020). Presented here is a case of Bing Neel syndrome (BNS) found in a 69-year-old man who died by suicide by jumping off a 135' bridge. His medical history was significant for traumatic brain injury, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. Bing Neel syndrome is a rare central nervous system complication of WM. His wife reported an abrupt mental deterioration starting 5 years before his death, characterized by paranoia, depression, and insomnia. He had been a high-functioning university professor. His decline culminated with the loss of independence in his activities of daily living. At autopsy, it was found that he experienced blunt force injuries related to the fall, causing his death. A neuropathologic examination revealed a brisk and fulminant clonal CD20 + /immunoglobulin M+ lymphocytic infiltrate, involving all sampled regions of his brain, consistent with WM. This workup was critical to obtaining an accurate pathologic diagnosis of BNS and understanding his full clinical status before death. Although BNS was not the proximate cause of death, this diagnosis aided the death investigation as a causal factor in his suicidality and was vital to providing his family closure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,10.1097/PAF.0000000000000824,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, it is not known if tDCS delivered via dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can be used to ameliorate both symptoms. The purpose of this case report was to share the effectiveness of using tDCS of the DLPFC with short inter-session intervals to reduce central pain and depression in a stroke survivor. A 45-year-old patient presented with CPSP and depression following a stroke. The CPSP and depression were diagnosed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questionnaire (DN4Q) and the Beck Depression Index (BDI) respectively. The pain score was 10 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and it was a hemi-body burning sensation, with a score of 7 on DN4Q, and the depression score was 25 on the BDI. The patient received anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC using two different application protocols. Initially, a stimulation session of 2 milliamperes (mA) intensity for 20 minutes was given every working day for 2 weeks. After 3 weeks, she then received 7 daily sessions of periodic stimulations of 2 mA intensity for 13 minutes each with 20 minutes inter-session intervals for 1 week. The patient was followed up for 6 months post-intervention. Immediately following the last session of the initial protocol of stimulation, the BDI score reduced from 25 to 7 and the pain became abolished. However, the symptoms relapsed at 3 weeks post-intervention to the initial BDI score of 25, VAS score of 10 and DN4Q score of 7. Following the application of the second protocol of stimulation, the BDI score improved to 18 at three weeks and later to 7 at six months post-intervention while the pain (both VAS and DN4Q) became completely abolished. Further research is needed to determine if a series of periodic tDCS with short-intersession intervals applied to the DLPFC may be more effective than a single tDCS with long inter-session intervals, in decreasing pain and inducing long-term improvement in mood in people with stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Physiotherapy theory and practice,10.1080/09593985.2021.1891591,,Transcranial direct current stimulation; central post-stroke pain; long-term potentiation; noninvasive brain stimulation; post-stroke depression,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We observed trazodone-induced delirium in three depressed patients who also suffered from preexisting organic cerebral lesions (two cases) or thyroideal dysfunction (one case). The appearance of hallucinations, psychomotoric agitation, and cognitive changes after initiation of trazodone therapy and their prompt cessation after drug discontinuation led to the impression that these were drug-induced phenomena. One possible hypothesis for the observed deliria is an oversensitivity to the effect of meta-chlorphenylpiperazine, which is a metabolite of trazodone with specific 5-HT agonistic properties.",{},,International clinical psychopharmacology,10.1097/00004850-199809000-00006,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This study aims to explore the phenomenon of seizure fear. Survey data have suggested that patients commonly fear death and/or brain damage as a result of their seizures, but documented cases of seizure phobia are rare and infrequently address issues of treatment. The study describes the exploration and successful cognitive behavioural treatment of a case of seizure phobia in a 26 year old woman with a 9 year history of epilepsy following a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The findings represent an important development in the much-neglected study of seizure fear. The case highlights some of the factors which may contribute to the genesis and maintenance of epilepsy-related psychopathologies and consequently has important implications for theoretical modelling in this area. Furthermore, it provides encouraging evidence to support the use of cognitive-behavioural techniques in treatment of these disorders.",{},,Seizure,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The poor prognosis combined with intensive treatment necessitates the inclusion of complementary and supportive therapies that optimize quality of life and reduce treatment-related declines in health. Exercise therapy has been shown to be beneficial in other cancer populations, but no evidence is available for brain cancer survivors. Therefore, we report results from 2 preliminary cases. Methods Two female patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme and oligodendroglioma participated in a structured and supervised 12-week exercise program. The program consisted of two 1-hour resistance and aerobic exercise sessions per week and additional self-managed aerobic sessions. Outcome measures of strength, cardiovascular fitness, and several psychological indicators (depression, anxiety, and quality of life) were recorded at baseline, after 6 weeks and at the conclusion of the intervention. Results Exercise was well tolerated; both participants completed all 24 sessions and the home-based component with no adverse effects. Objective outcome measures displayed positive responses relating to reduced morbidity. Similar positive responses were found for psychological outcomes. Scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed clinically meaningful improvements in depression and total distress. Conclusion These findings provide initial evidence that, despite the difficulties associated with brain cancer treatment and survivorship, exercise may be safe and beneficial and should be considered in the overall management of patients with brain cancer.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Integrative cancer therapies,10.1177/1534735415600068,PMC5736053,anxiety; comprehensive cancer care; depression; exercise oncology; neuro-oncology,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The authors present two case reports of patients who developed the new onset of kleptomania after closed head trauma. Both patients had comorbid psychiatric symptoms associated with the kleptomania. Antidepressant monotherapy was not beneficial in reducing kleptomania in either patient. Kleptomanic behavior was successfully treated in both patients, however, through combination treatment using an antidepressant agent together with adjunctive cognitive behavioral therapy or adjunctive naltrexone. In one patient, single photon emission tomography showed a perfusion deficit in the left temporal lobe. Various hypotheses regarding this finding and the etiopathology of kleptomania are discussed. Review of current work in the field suggests that kleptomania is a heterogeneous disorder that shares features of both impulse and addiction disorders as well as affective spectrum disorders.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/01.wnf.0000144042.66342.d3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Previous hypotheses about mechanisms of polyopia have included cortical spreading depression, the vague idea of abnormal visual synthesis, and the holographic or holonomic brain theory. We propose a new mechanism due to dysfunction of the network from the PPC [Formula: see text] frontal eye field (FEF) [Formula: see text] paramedian midbrain and pontine reticular formation leading to convergence insufficiency, which leads to horizontal diplopia.

Commonly reported serotonergic side-effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, nervousness and orthostatic hypotension. Trazodone, a non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is often used in conjunction with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in order to combat the insomnia associated with fluoxetine. Successful use of this combination is generally limited by the cumulative serotonergic side-effects of the two medications. This paper describes the first reported case of speech dysfunction as a complication of combined trazodone and fluoxetine use. A 43-year-old male suffered bilateral wrist fractures and a moderate TBI during a fall. Within 1 week of adding fluoxetine to trazodone the patient developed new-onset dysarthria and speech blocking. Upon discontinuation of fluoxetine, speech returned to normal.

To investigate the possible consequences of such lesions on social cognition, we tested a selected patient, MVG, a 44-year-old man with a focal caudate nucleus (CN) lesion following stroke. In the aftermath of this stroke, MVG shows loss of empathy and difficulties recognizing emotions in others. The dual aims of this study were first, to evaluate the implications of CN on ToM and recognition of emotion, and second, to discuss these results as a consequence of a disconnection of the sub-cortical orbito-frontal (OF) loop due to caudate damage. We performed a complete neuropsychological assessment of MVG, as well as different tasks evaluating social cognition, such as the Faux-Pas Test and the Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test. No deficits were found in the neuropsychological tests. However, on tasks assessing social cognition, MVG showed impairments in the ""warm"" or ""affective"" part of ToM as well as in the ability to recognize negative emotions (i.e., sadness and fear). These results indicate that damage to the head of the left CN can lead to impairment of ToM and emotion recognition. Furthermore, the data shows that, in MVG, such impairment appears to be due to a disconnection of the sub-cortical OF circuit resulting from damage to the CN. Neuro-imaging data tends to confirm this hypothesis by bringing out a hypo-perfusion in both, the territory of his left CN and prefrontal (i.e., ventromedial) brain areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.01.004,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Growing evidence suggests that it may be associated with the specific regions of the brain, preexisting subcortical atrophy, a family history of mood disorders, and chronic vascular burden. However, the development of bipolar disorder after stroke is uncommon in a patient with chronic major depression.

This is a case report and review of the literature. Electroconvulsive therapy is widely viewed as a safe and effective treatment for major depressive disorder; however, there remains some uncertainty regarding the safety of ECT in patients with cerebral aneurysms. Many cases exist documenting the safety of ECT in patients with both secured and unsecured cerebral aneurysms; however, these patients had aneurysms that were associated with a low (ie, ≤2.6%) 5-year cumulative rupture rate, whereas the patient in our case had an aneurysm associated with a 14.5% five-year cumulative rupture rate. We stress that ECT should not be viewed as a universally safe procedure in patients with cerebral aneurysms and the 5-year cumulative aneurysm rupture rate should be used in the discussion of the risk-benefit ratio of ECT in patients with unsecured cerebral aneurysms.",{},,The journal of ECT,10.1097/YCT.0000000000000573,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The phenomenon is typically observed following ischemic stroke, but has also been characterized during seizure activity--in particular, status epilepticus (SE). Neurological outcome has varied widely in published reports, with some patients achieving full neurologic recovery, while others experience persistent disability. Case report and literature review. We present a 54-year-old man found unresponsive with a right hemispheric syndrome several days after discharge following amygdalohippocampectomy for refractory right temporal lobe epilepsy. Prolonged electroencephalogram demonstrated one subclinical right frontal seizure, along with right frontal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, presumed to be associated with SE preceding his admission. Initial MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion on diffusion weighted imaging in the right cerebral hemisphere, ipsilateral thalamus, and contralateral cerebellum. A head CT one week later showed diffuse sulcal effacement with loss of gray-white differentiation in the right frontal and insular regions with low attenuation changes of right thalamus. An MRI showed worsened diffusion restriction, despite a corresponding increase in perfusion. The patient remained paretic at discharge and follow-up. Follow-up MRI at 2 months demonstrated pronounced right cerebral and left cerebellar atrophy, loss of gray matter in much of the right cerebrum, and scattered areas of T2 hyperintensity, consistent with permanent right fronto-temporal neuronal loss. Collectively, these observations indicate that imaging findings of persistent cerebral restricted diffusion and cytotoxic edema in the subacute post-ictal period may predict irreversible neuronal injury and poor long-term outcome-even when accompanied by evidence of cortical hyperperfusion and recovery of second- and third-order neurons along the involved circuit.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-015-0155-4,,Deafferentation; Excitotoxic injury; Hyperactivation; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Amitriptyline is effective for treatment of poststroke pain and particularly useful in concomitant depression. Unexpectedly, this patient developed new psychopathologies after initiation of this medication. This case highlights the development of new psychopathologies that could be due to the antidepressant, underlying bipolar disorder or a complication of the stroke itself.

We have described two patients with secondary mania following a stroke. One had a large left hemisphere cerebral infarction and the symptoms arose about 2.5 years later, possibly triggered by a transient ischemic attack involving the right hemisphere. The other had an infarction in the right posterior artery territory extending to the thalamus and internal capsule together with infarctions in the deep border zones of both hemispheres at the level of the centrum semiovale with the manic symptoms concomitant with the onset of the event. The clinical and neuro-anatomic mechanisms that underlie the diverse locations of secondary mania are discussed. The cerebral components of secondary mania and disinhibition syndromes are very similar and it is proposed that disinhibition syndromes, secondary hypomania and secondary mania with and without psychotic symptoms are simply a continuum of severity of mood disorder and secondary mania with psychotic symptoms may be an extreme form. The concept of secondary mania in the elderly is not likely to disappear although several unresolved issues remain. For the neurophysician, geriatrician, and the psychiatrist there is much to be attained by simplifying the issues and accepting the view that secondary mania is a discrete entity.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,10.1016/j.archger.2005.10.009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

19540415,[Carbon monoxide intoxication and anterograde amnesia].,"Mahmoud, O; Mestour, M; Loualidi, M",Mahmoud,"Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is still one of the most frequent conditions causing brain damage as a result of hypoxia in Morocco, and the main area of brain damage is the hippocampus. The role of the hippocampus in the memory process has been known for long and we usually associate hippocampus damage with anterograde amnesia. Nevertheless, the pure amnesic syndrome is retrieved in the isolated damage of the hippocampus as is seen in the anoxia caused by CO intoxication. The outcome of the patterns depends on the extent of brain damage, the age of onset and the early diagnosis. This study presents the case of a young female patient who presented with anterograde amnesia after massive and prolonged accidental exposition to CO that presented disproportional radiological and clinical outcome. Primary care was in the intensive care unit during 24 hours and based on oxygen therapy and diuretics. The psychiatric examination found an acute stress disorder and symptoms of delirium in the form of reduced awareness and memory deficit. The amnesia was anterograde and the patient exhibited diminished ability to remember time, space and persons. The Galveston orientation and amnesia test (GOAT) score on awakening in the intensive care unit was 46. The laboratory findings did not provide direct physiological disturbances. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral hippocampus low-density in the cerebral white and grey matter. The clinical and the radiological outcome of this pattern were not correlated. The GOAT scores were 46 on the 10th day and 50 when the patient was discharged three weeks later, although the brain CT scan showed a decrease of the low-density in the hippocampus. Forty-five days later, the GOAT score was still 49 and the brain CT scan did not show any low-density lesion. Clinical symptoms of a major depressive episode were installed. These results are correlated to the findings of several series in which the CT scans in CO intoxication show common characteristic features that are symmetrical low-density lesions in the cerebral white matter in some specific brain structures such as the globus pallidus and the hippocampus. The early diagnosis is usually difficult because the brain CT scan findings do not always provide morphological changes and fail approximately one half of the time to detect low-density in the white matter of the hippocampus, and the use of MRI is not as easy as the CT scan. The long period of unconsciousness, the white matter damage and the late diagnosis result in complications in the outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,L'Encephale,10.1016/j.encep.2008.02.011,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

33272325,"Treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in a patient with a history of traumatic brain injury, partial brain resection, and brainstem stroke: a case report.","Young, Fletcher Graham; Nguyen, Diep",Young,"Pseudobulbar affect is a very distressing and underdiagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder that causes contextually inappropriate episodes of laughing and crying and general emotional incontinence. Although many proposed etiologies exist, the most widely accepted theory espouses the disruption of a corticopontine-cerebellar circuit that governs the modulation of emotional response. Pseudobulbar affect is commonly diagnosed secondary to primary neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Traditional pharmacological treatment of pseudobulbar affect is largely comprised of antidepressant therapy, including tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluvoxamine. However, neither of these medication classes has been studied for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect in controlled trials, and their utility remains questionable. We describe a case of a 62-year-old Caucasian man with history of traumatic brain injury, ischemic brainstem stroke, and depression who developed intractable pseudobulbar affect. This patient's intensely distressing symptoms were not alleviated by amitriptyline. However, after being placed on fixed-dose 20 mg/10 mg dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta), our patient experienced complete resolution of his symptoms. He has experienced no deleterious side effects. This case provides anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of dextromethorphan/quinidine in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect with remarkably swift and complete cessation of symptoms.

The neuromarkers in Quantitative EEG (QEEG) and Event-related potentials (ERPs) were utilized in the construction of protocol and evaluation. A 45-year-old female after successful neuro-ophthalmic surgery of the meningioma, complained of severe pain and anxiety, difficulties with sleeping, attention and memory problems, as well as inability to continue working in her given profession. Neuropsychological testing showed lack of cognitive disturbances and post-operative depression. Two working hypotheses were tested to find neuromarkers of depression and anxiety. In line with the 'depression hypothesis' a frontal alpha asymmetry pattern was found in the patient, and in line with the 'anxiety' hypothesis an increased left temporal P1 wave in response to visual stimuli was found in ERPs. A specific alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol combined with an anodal tDCS was suggested. Twenty sessions of individually-tailored anodal tDCs/ neurofeedback protocol were performed. The QEEG frontal asymmetry pattern and the excessive temporal P1 wave were normalized after the intervention. The patient recovered from post-operative depression and returned to work after 20 sessions of the combined neurofeedback/tDCS protocol.

However, there is a notable paucity of psychological interventions which have been tested with adult BT patients. An acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based manualized program was developed for anxious and/or depressed BT patients. The preliminary efficacy of this program was initially tested using a proof-of-concept study design based on a case series of four clinically distressed BT patients. Three of the four participants no longer met criteria for anxiety and/or depressive disorders at post-therapy, and these effects were maintained at 3 months of follow-up. The fourth participant, who had a premorbid psychiatric history, experienced a stabilization of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Given the current dearth of studies which have tested psychological interventions for distressed BT survivors, these preliminary findings have promising clinical utility. However, the efficacy of psychological interventions tailored for clinically distressed BT patients needs to be further tested using larger-scale controlled trial designs.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,10.1007/s00520-015-2804-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

RSNM enables personalized targeting of focal neuromodulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is believed to exert antidepressant efficacy by modulating connectivity between the stimulation site, the default mode network (DMN), and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Personalized rTMS may be particularly useful after repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with neurodegenerative tauopathy in medial temporal limbic structures. These degenerative changes are believed to be related to treatment-resistant neurobehavioral disturbances observed in many retired athletes. The authors describe a case in which RSNM was successfully used to target rTMS to treat these neuropsychiatric disturbances in a retired NFL defensive lineman whose symptoms were not responsive to conventional treatments. RSNM was used to identify left-right dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS targets with maximal difference between dorsal attention network and DMN correlations. These targets were spatially distinct from those identified by prior methods. Twenty sessions of left-sided excitatory and right-sided inhibitory rTMS were administered at these targets. Treatment led to improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (72%), cognitive testing, and headache scales scores. Compared with healthy individuals and subjects with TBI-associated depression, baseline rsfMRI revealed substantially elevated DMN connectivity with the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Serial rsfMRI scans revealed gradual improvement in MTL-DMN connectivity and stimulation site connectivity with sgACC. These results highlight the possibility of individualized neuromodulation and biomarker-based monitoring for neuropsychiatric sequelae of repetitive TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1176/appi.neuropsych.18100230,,CTE; Imaging Techniques; Mood Disorders (Neuropsychiatric Aspects); Neuroanatomy; Organic Mental Disorders; TBI; Traumatic Brain Injury; fMRI; rTMS,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The amygdala is another structure that has been widely implicated in emotion processing and social decision-making, and the question arises as to whether the amygdala, in a manner akin to what has been observed for the prefrontal cortex, might have sex-related functional asymmetry in regard to social and emotional functions. A preliminary test of this question was carried out in the current study, where we used a case-matched lesion approach and contrasted a pair of men cases and a pair of women cases, where in each pair one patient had left amygdala damage and the other had right amygdala damage. We investigated the domains of social conduct, emotional processing and personality, and decision-making. The results provide support for the notion that there is sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala in regard to these functions - in the male pair, the patient with right-sided amygdala damage was impaired in these functions, and the patient with left-sided amygdala damage was not, whereas in the female pair, the opposite pattern obtained, with the left-sided woman being impaired and the right-sided woman being unimpaired. These data provide preliminary support for the notion that sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala may entail functions such as social conduct, emotional processing, and decision-making, a finding that in turn could reflect (as either a cause or effect) differences in the manner in which men and women apprehend, process, and execute emotion-related information.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790902775492,PMC2829120,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",England,eng

Symptoms were those that accompanied prior episodes of mania. In addition, signs of temporal lobe dysfunction were evident including periods of detachment, déjà vu experiences, and olfactory hallucinations. In the context of mania, depersonalization was initially attributed to bipolar symptoms. Only several months later, when olfactory hallucinations and alterations in consciousness became evident, was a temporal lobe lesion suspected. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities responded to a combination of surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and topiramate, however the tumor was advanced and invasive at diagnosis resulting in a poor prognosis.

It affects 2 to 3 per 1000 individuals. CP is also associated with sensory, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional sequelae. Few systematic studies of psychiatric comorbidities in children and adolescents with CP have been conducted, as the main focus of concern has been on the physical disabilities. This has diverted attention from treatable psychiatric syndromes. Proper psychiatric evaluation of children with CP is an important task, as appropriate interventions can help them reach their full potential and enhance the quality of their lives and those of their families. We report the case of an individual with CP with behavioral and emotional symptoms to illustrate the diagnostic complexity involved. The case highlights the importance of engaging in a comprehensive diagnostic psychiatric evaluation process to assess and suggest treatment options for accompanying comorbid psychiatric conditions.",{},,Current psychiatry reports,10.1007/s11920-010-0096-8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It is infrequent and often its discovery is incidental, a so-called incidentaloma. However, these lesions can be symptomatic, causing headaches, epilepsy, cerebral hemorrhage and other neurological signs depending on the brain area involved. Frontal localization is responsible for psychiatric disorders, particularly the prefrontal region, leading to prefrontal syndrome, a condition common in all frontal lobe tumors. Psychopathological syndrome can be depression-type, pseudodepression syndrome or maniac-type, pseudomaniac syndrome. Surgical treatment of lesions like this may not always be possible due to their location in eloquent areas. In this study, we describe an unusual association of migraine-like headache, epilepsy and frontal lobe pseudodepression late-onset syndrome in the same patient. We have considered this case interesting mainly for the rarity of both a headache with migraine features and for the late onset of pseudodepression syndrome. Pathophysiology underlying migraine-like headache and that concerning the late-onset pseudodepression frontal lobe syndrome seems to be unclear. This case leads to further hypotheses about the mechanisms responsible for headache syndromes and psychopathological disorders, in the specific case when caused by a cerebral frontal lobe lesion.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,International medical case reports journal,10.2147/IMCRJ.S133465,PMC5426470,cavernous angioma; cerebral cavernoma; frontal syndrome; headache; pseudode-pression syndrome,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

This is partly because of concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria. In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study. Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure. The stimulation was well tolerated and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2014.09.010,,Brain injuries; Case report; Depression; Rehabilitation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

For four years, she first suffered from a paranoid-hallucinatory state and then a depressive one episodically. In the course of the latter, severe anemia developed. She was diagnosed as Castleman's disease, because the increased serum level of gamma-globulin and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and multiple lymphomata were evidenced. A paranoid-hallucinatory state relapsed about one year later from this episode. At last, some bulbar and cerebellar symptoms, and a delirium suddenly occurred. The ischemic changes at the level of the pons and midbrain were revealed by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. It is certainly that both neurological and psychiatric symptoms were related to the lesions. This ischemic lesions may have resulted from the anoxia secondary to the severe anemia and/or hyperviscosity syndrome in the disease. On the other hand, the increased serum level of IL-6 as well as the ischemic lesions might have caused psychiatric symptoms in this case, as the interferone which is one of the analogues of IL-6, is known to induce emotional and behavioral symptoms.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

We report the case of a 49-year-old woman, with bipolar disorder and depression, undergoing treatment with lithium, antidepressants and antipsychotics, who was admitted to hospital due to a clinical picture of visual hallucinations with an elevated lithaemia of 2.1 mEq/L (therapeutic range: 0.6-1.2 mEq/L). The patient developed a severe encephalopathy that required the use of assisted ventilation in the intensive care unit. Initial magnetic resonance imaging showed a reversible bilateral symmetrical hyperintensity in the dentate nuclei in T2 and T2-FLAIR sequences. Over the following months she gradually developed a pancerebellar syndrome with evidence of a marked loss of bilateral volume in the cerebellum, above all at the expense of the vermis, which was accompanied by a permanent and disabling cerebellar syndrome. Although treatment with lithium can cause a variety of neurological side effects, they are usually reversible. However, they occasionally give rise to permanent and disabling sequelae, as in the case of the patient reported here, with a marked and progressive cerebellar atrophy, accompanied by permanent sequelae in the form of a disabling cerebellar syndrome.

We report a patient with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who underwent presurgical video-electroencephalogram (EEG)-monitoring with normal psychiatric and neuropsychological findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense lesion within the right amygdala but no contrast enhancement. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed pleocytosis and positive oligoclonal bands, but all tests for neurotropic viruses or borrelia antibodies were negative. Presurgical evaluation identified a right mesiotemporal focus. As a tumour was the most likely differential diagnosis, we performed selective amygdalohippocampectomy of the right hemisphere. Subsequent histopathological examination revealed the surprising diagnosis of LE. As a consequence, tumour screening was initiated and a testicular carcinoma with high anti-Ma2-antibody titres was detected. Following surgical and chemotherapeutical treatment, the patient was seizure-free and Ma2-antibodies decreased below detection limits. Conclusion - This case report highlights that LE has to be considered even in patients with atypical clinical presentation, i.e. without neuropsychological deficits, if CSF analysis reveals an inflammatory response. When LE is diagnosed, extensive tumour search is mandatory to detect and treat the paraneoplastic origin of LE. Therapeutic strategies of LE include surgical treatment as well as early immunosuppression.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01020.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Denmark,eng

Implications for a neurology of depression.,"Ross, E D; Rush, A J",Ross,"Recognizing depression in brain-damaged patients poses considerable problems. The standard diagnostic criteria often are not applicable since the neurological lesion may distort or even obliterate salient features of depression. Patients actually may deny being depressed or dysphoric, not have a depressive affect, or be totally unaware of abnormal vegetative behaviors. Furthermore, brain lesions themselves may produce striking behavioral alterations that can be mistakenly attributed to depression, or striking behavioral changes due to depression may be mistakenly attributed to the brain lesion. Based on five case studies, several clinical guidelines for recognizing and diagnosing depression in brain-damaged patients are offered. These cases also provide a data base to generate initial hypotheses about the neuroanatomical basis of the depressive syndrome. By observing how focal brain lesions modify the signs and symptoms of depression, inferences are made about brain areas crucial for modulating the various features of the depressive syndrome.",{},,Archives of general psychiatry,10.1001/archpsyc.1981.01780370046005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

SN's neuropsychological, structural and functional imaging findings are compared with similar reported cases and are discussed in the framework of fronto-subcortical circuits and their proposed behavioural disorders. SN's mania was characterized by restlessness, mood elevation, a tendency for pleasurable activities, inflated self-esteem and loss of disease awareness. Other symptoms were sexual disinhibition, tactlessness, abnormal discourse, and reduced need for food and sleep. His neuropsychological assessment revealed an anterograde amnesia, and an impairment of frontal-executive functions. A SPECT-study showed diaschisis-related areas of hypoperfusion in both prefrontal regions which were interpreted as equivalents of SN's frontal-dysexecutive syndrome. In addition, there was a perfusion deficit in the right orbitofrontal cortex, which was taken as the imaging correlate of SN's secondary mania and personality disorder. These findings suggest that SN's mania and his other symptoms result from the twofold disruption of fronto-subcortical connections, namely of the right orbitofrontal loop which is concerned with mood regulation and socially appropriate behaviour, and of the dorsolateral prefrontal loop which mediates executive cognitive functions.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00108-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
