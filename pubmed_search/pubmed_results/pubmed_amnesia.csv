11752477,Episodic memory: from mind to brain.,"Tulving, Endel",Tulving,"Episodic memory is a neurocognitive (brain/mind) system, uniquely different from other memory systems, that enables human beings to remember past experiences. The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.",{},,Annual review of psychology,10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135114,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

23296343,Transient amnesic syndromes.,"Bartsch, Thorsten; Butler, Christopher",Bartsch,"Transient amnesic syndromes are striking clinical phenomena that are commonly encountered by physicians in acute medical settings. Diagnosis of such syndromes can be challenging, and their causes have been debated for over 50 years. Critical clinical distinctions, such as between transient global amnesia (TGA) and transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), as well as important clues to the underlying pathophysiology, have recently been revealed. TGA is characterized by the sudden onset of a profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia that lasts for up to 24 h, with neuroimaging after an acute TGA event showing transient perturbation of specific hippocampal circuits that are involved in memory processing. Some cases of transient amnesia are attributable to focal seizure activity and are termed TEA, which has a clinical presentation similar to that of TGA, but can be distinguished from the latter by the brevity and frequency of amnesic attacks. Moreover, TEA carries a risk of persistent memory impairment that can be mistaken for dementia. Here, we summarize clinically relevant aspects of transient amnesic syndromes, giving practical recommendations for diagnosis and patient management. We describe results from imaging and epidemiological studies that have shed light on the functional anatomy and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Nature reviews.

MRI studies demonstrated damage to the splenium, and to a region containing the retrosplenial cortex and the cingulate bundle. The fornix was anterior and inferior to the site of maximal damage, but may have been involved; the stria terminalis was probably spared. Structures known to be important in memory but spared by the lesion included the hippocampus, thalamus, and basal forebrain. The retrosplenial cortex receives input from the subiculum and projects to the anterior thalamus, thus providing an alternative route between hippocampus and thalamus. Perhaps more importantly, medial temporal structures involved in memory receive anterior thalamic input directly via the cingulate bundle and indirectly through a relay in the retrosplenial cortex. We suggest that this thalamocortical portion of Papez' circuit may be important in memory, and that lesions of the cingulum and retrosplenial cortex may cause amnesia by disrupting this pathway.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/110.6.1631,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report a two-part study. First, we studied 4 patients with bilateral medial thalamic infarctions using magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. All patients were followed for more than 1 year. Using a stereotactic method, we plotted the lesions in an atlas delineating the probable structure involved. Secondly, in 2 monkeys, using autoradiography, we traced the pathway from the amygdala to the dorsomedial nucleus, paying particular attention to the intrathalamic course of the amygdalothalamic projections. Our findings were (1) patients develop amnesia when infarctions are located anteriorly; (2) in patients with amnesia, the lesions can be small and strategically located, probably interfering with both hippocampal-related neural structures such as the mamillothalamic tract, and amygdala-related neural structures such as the ventroamygdalofugal pathway; and (3) a specific component of the latter is situated lateral but immediately adjacent to the mamillothalamic tract in the monkey, enabling both structures to be damaged bilaterally by small mirror image lesions. The amnesia is characterized by deficits in anterograde verbal and visual learning and in retrograde amnesia, but motor learning is preserved.

Although previously studied as independent phenomena, there are increasing reports of co-occurrence of these two pathologies. We report a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with recurrent thunderclap headaches over the course of 1 week with sudden onset of anterograde memory loss. His medications included a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and intermittent use of pseudoephedrine. On examination he was amnestic to recent events and notably perseverating. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain without contrast showed a small, punctate focus of restricted diffusion in the left hippocampus. He was diagnosed with TGA based on his clinical presentation. His headaches and amnesia resolved over the next 12 h throughout the course of his stay with acetaminophen and oral verapamil and he was discharged. Repeat computed tomography angiogram at 2 weeks revealed diffuse and segmental narrowing of the anterior and posterior intracranial circulation, which resolved on follow-up imaging at 3 months, confirming RCVS. The acute and reversible nature of these conditions and increasing reports of co-occurrence suggests a common pathophysiologic link.

37916950,A case of severe anterograde amnesia in the era of smartphone technology.,"Annese, Jacopo; Klaming, Ruth; Haase Alasantro, Lori; Feinstein, Justin S",Annese,"A.V. is a young herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) survivor who suffered extensive bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) leading to a severe and pervasive form of anterograde amnesia. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed lesions that encompass the hippocampus and amygdala in both hemispheres and that extend more laterally in the right temporal lobe. At the same time, detailed neuropsychological testing showed that the disparity between A.V.'s preserved intellectual functioning (Full Scale IQ: 115) and severe memory deficit (Delayed Memory Index: 42) is one of the largest on record. Despite this deficit, A.V. has regained a higher level of functioning and autonomy compared to previously documented amnesic cases with major bilateral MTL lesions. As a millennial, one advantage which A.V. has over prior amnesic cases is fluency with digital technology - particularly the smartphone. The analysis of his phone and specific app usage showed a pattern that is consistent with the strategy to offload cognitive tasks that would normally be supported by the MTL. A.V.'s behavior is significant in terms of rehabilitation and may have broader implications at the societal level and for public health given the ubiquity of smartphone technology and its potential to become integrated with neural mnemonic functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/13803395.2023.2254911,,Brain; amnesia; encephalitis; hippocampus; medial temporal lobe,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

34851869,Cerebellar Ischemia Presenting as Transient Global Amnesia.,"Morena, Jonathan; Kamdar, Hera A; Adeli, Amir",Morena,"Transient global amnesia (TGA) consists of acute-onset anterograde amnesia and typically resolves within 24 hours. Reported etiologies of TGA include transient ischemia to the hippocampus or thalamus, migraine, venous flow abnormalities, and epilepsy. There are no reports of cerebellar ischemia as an etiology of TGA. A 78-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes presented to the Ohio State University ER after a period of anterograde amnesia lasting 3 hours. She was alert during the event, but asked the same questions repeatedly. Upon arrival to the ER, she was hypertensive but clinically back to baseline, with no recall of the 3-hour time period. An MRI of her brain revealed an isolated hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at the junction of the superior cerebellum and vermis, with apparent diffusion coefficient correlation. Vascular imaging of the brain and neck and a routine EEG were unremarkable. We diagnosed her with cerebellar ischemia presenting as TGA. She had no head injury, migraine, or history of epilepsy to suggest alternative etiologies of TGA. An increasing amount of literature has reported that the cerebellum is linked to the limbic system. A case series of SPECT imaging on individuals with TGA revealed transient cerebellar vermis hypoperfusion in addition to hippocampal DWI changes. We present what may be a novel report of isolated cerebellar ischemia presenting as TGA, and we add to the literature for clinicians to consider the possibility that damage to the cerebellum or its circuit to the cerebrum or thalamus can present as TGA.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000287,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Consistent with this, transient uni- or bilateral punctiform hyperintense lesions may be found on DWI-MRI sequences, usually without correlation on FLAIR-weighthed MR-images. Symptoms usually resolve within twenty-four hours. There is no need for a specific therapy. A prophylactic therapy, such as antithrombotic treatment, is not indicated. The prognosis is usually good, the risk of a recurrence is about 18%.",{},,Praxis,10.1024/1661-8157/a003833,,Stroke Mimics; Transient global amnesia; Transiente globale Amnesie; amnestic syndrome; amnestisches Syndrom; stroke mimics; transient epileptic amnesia; transiente epileptische Amnesie; vascular stroke; zerebrovaskuläre Ischämie,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,ger

We argue how careful consideration of clinical, electrophysiological and imaging findings can resolve this apparent contradiction and lead to a diagnosis of early symptomatic post-stroke seizures that links brain structure to function in a new, clinically relevant way. A 70-year-old patient was identified in clinical practice in our tertiary care centre and was evaluated clinically as well as by repeated electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging. The presenting complaint were recurrent episodes of short-term memory disturbance which manifested as isolated anterograde amnesia on neurocognitive evaluation. EEG and MRI revealed predominantly right frontotemporal spikes and a punctate diffusion-restricted lesion in the left hippocampus, respectively. Both symptoms and EEG changes subsided under anticonvulsant treatment with levetiracetam. Our report contributes to the current discussion of clinical challenges in the differential diagnosis of transient memory disturbance. It suggests that focal diffusion-restricted hippocampal lesions, as seen in TGA, might be ischemic and thus highlights the importance of considering post-stroke seizures as a possible cause of transient memory disturbance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02543-8,PMC8744318,Diffusion lesion; Ischemic stroke; Symptomatic seizure; Transient epileptic amnesia; Transient global amnesia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In displaying such ""episodic amnesia,"" which encompasses an entire lifetime of personal experiences, K.C. differs from many other amnesic cases. Here, we document for the first time the full extent of K.C.'s brain damage using MRI-based quantitative measurements. We then review the many investigations with K.C. that have contributed to our understanding not only of episodic and semantic memory but also to the development of other aspects of memory theory.

Bilateral hippocampal lesions lead to persistent anterograde amnesia while unilateral damage results in milder, content-specific forms of amnesia. Hippocampus may be affected by an acute or chronic pathologic process from a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. A 61-year-old female patient with a long history of hypertension, glucose intolerance, hypercholesterolemia and depression was hospitalized for acute anterograde amnesia, which led to repeated excessive drug taking. By further examinations that included laboratory tests, electroencephalography, Doppler sonography of intra- and extracranial vessels and neurovisualization methods [multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain] bilateral hippocampal ischemia that occurred at different times was detected. Cognitive and neuropsychological evaluation revealed an isolated severe damage of episodic memory with the inability of retention of new information which persisted at the control examination three months later. The assumed mechanism of occurrence of ischemia in this case could be arterioarterial embolism. Although ischemic stroke is one of the most common neurological diseases, ischemic stroke of the hippocampus is rare, the isolated bilateral presentation with clinical signs of severe amnestic syndrome in particular.

36593745,Global Transient Amnesia as the Predominant Symptom of Cardiac Myxoma: A Case Report.,"Shrestha, Pritee; Obholz, Jacob; Chang, Tiffany; Adio, Babajide",Shrestha,"BACKGROUND The most common neurological symptoms from cardiac myxoma-induced stroke include territories of middle cerebral arteries, rendering posterior stroke less common. Although transient global amnesia usually has a benign prognosis, amnesia in the setting of concerning cerebellar symptoms should raise the suspicion for posterior circulation involvement. These benign-appearing symptoms can be manifestations of an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA). This unusual presentation can delay workup for underlying pathology. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman presented to the local emergency department after an episode of global amnesia that lasted about 15 minutes and was associated with some dizziness. The patient also reported a history of chronic disequilibrium. The head CT scan was negative for any acute findings. A follow-up MRI of the brain demonstrated acute small lacunar infarcts within the left cerebellum and right parietal lobe. An echocardiogram was performed due to concern for the cardioembolic source, which revealed left atrial myxoma. She was transferred to a tertiary center for immediate surgical intervention due to the high risk of embolization associated with the condition. The patient subsequently underwent successful surgical excision of the lesion. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac myxoma, although a rare cause of posterior stroke, needs prompt intervention as it is associated with a high risk of systemic embolization, including recurrent CVA. Transient global amnesia is an atypical presentation of cardiac myxoma that can easily be overlooked, delaying timely diagnosis and prompt intervention. Early recognition and surgical resection are crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.938221,PMC9826667,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

On arrival to our outpatient clinic, she was alert and oriented and did not have chest pain or shortness of breath. Neurological and neuropsychological examinations were within normal limits. In light of a transient anterograde amnestic attack and no neurological focal deficit, we clinically diagnosed transient global amnesia (TGA). To confirm whether there was an intracranial lesion or not, diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain was performed, and revealed hyper-intense lesions in the left hippocampus and right corpus callosum. Consequently, the patient was admitted to our hospital on follow-up for suspected cerebral infarction. On day 1, laboratory tests indicated an elevated troponin I level, and electrocardiogram revealed an inverted T wave in the inferior leads. Coronary angiography on day 9 of admission demonstrated severe stenosis of the right coronary artery, leading to a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.

K.C. suffered severe anterograde amnesia in both verbal and non-verbal domains which was accompanied by selective retrograde amnesia for personal events experienced prior to the time of his injury (episodic memory), with relative preservation of memory for personal and world facts (semantic memory), and of implicit memory. This pattern of spared and impaired memory extended to spatial memory for large-scale environments and beyond memory to future imagining and decision-making. Post-mortem brain findings at age 62 included moderate diffuse atrophy, left orbitofrontal contusion, left posterior cerebral artery infarct, and left anterior frontal watershed infarct. Notably, there was severe neuronal loss and gliosis of the hippocampi bilaterally. The left hippocampus was severely affected anteriorly and posteriorly, but CA2, CA4, and the dentate gyrus (DG) were focally spared. There was associated degeneration of the left fornix. The right hippocampus showed near complete destruction anteriorly, with relative preservation posteriorly, mainly of CA4 and DG. Bilateral parahippocampal gyri and left anterior thalamus also showed neuron loss and gliosis. There was no evidence of co-existing neurodegenerative phenomena on beta-amyloid, phosphorylated tau, or TDP-43 immunostaining. The extent of damage to medial temporal lobe structures is in keeping with K.C.'s profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, with the exception of the unexpected finding of preserved CA2/CA4 and DG. K.C.'s case demonstrates that relatively clean functional dissociations are still possible following widespread brain damage, with structurally compromised brain regions unlikely to be critical to cognitive functions found to be intact. In this way, the findings presented here add to K.C.'s significant contributions to our understanding of clinical-anatomical relationships in memory.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107342,,Amnesia; Episodic memory; Ex-vivo MRI; Medial temporal lobes; Neurohistology; Patient K.C.,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The feature of the impairment of our patient was similar to that of diencephalic amnesia, and a single photon emission computed tomography study showed a relative hypoperfusion in the right cerebellar hemisphere and left anterior thalamus.

Non-pharmacological interventions are frequently used to manage agitation, yet their efficacy is largely unknown. This systematic review aims to synthesize current evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for agitation during PTA in adults with TBI. Key databases searched included MEDLINE Ovid SP interface, PubMed, CINAHL, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO and CENTRAL, with additional online reviewing of key journals and clinical trial registries to identify published or unpublished studies up to May 2020. Eligible studies included participants aged 16 years and older, showing agitated behaviours during PTA. Any non-pharmacological interventions for reducing agitation were considered, with any comparator accepted. Eligible studies were critically appraised for methodological quality using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Instruments and findings were reported in narrative form. Twelve studies were included in the review: two randomized cross-over trials, three quasi-experimental studies, four cases series and three case reports. Non-pharmacological interventions were music therapy, behavioural strategies and environmental modifications, physical restraints and electroconvulsive therapy. Key methodological concerns included absence of a control group, a lack of formalised agitation measurement and inconsistent concomitant use of pharmacology. Interventions involving music therapy had the highest level of evidence, although study quality was generally low to moderate. Further research is needed to evaluate non-pharmacological interventions for reducing agitation during PTA after TBI.Systematic review registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42020186802), registered May 2020.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuropsychology review,10.1007/s11065-022-09544-5,PMC10148768,Agitation; Effectiveness; Inpatient care; Non-pharmacological intervention; Post-traumatic amnesia; Traumatic brain injury,"Systematic Review; Case Reports; Journal Article; Review; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
22824728,The impairment of recollection in functional amnesic states.,"Markowitsch, Hans J; Staniloiu, Angelica",Markowitsch,"Functional amnesia refers to various forms of amnesia, which have no direct organic brain basis. Psychological stress and trauma were etiologically linked to its development across various cultures. We have studied several patients with functional amnesia, employing neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Herein we provide a review of the current understanding of the phenomenology, neuropsychology and neurobiology of functional amnesia, which we illustrate by reference to five own case descriptions and other cases presented in the literature. Functional amnesia is mostly of retrograde nature and presents in the form of a memory blockade or repression to recollect episodic-autobiographical events, which may cover the whole past life. Sometimes, the recollection impairment is localized to certain time epochs. In comparison to functional retrograde amnesia, functional isolated anterograde amnesia is much rarer and data on its neurobiology are scant. In patients with functional amnesia with pronounced retrograde episodic-autobiographical memory impairments, we identified changes in brain metabolism, above all reductions in the temporo-frontal regions of the right hemisphere. Recently, even subtle structural changes in the white matter of the (right) frontal cortex were described in functional retrograde amnesia by other researchers. The disruption in recollection in functional amnesia is often accompanied by changes in personality dimensions, pertaining to cognition (self-related processing, theory of mind), autonoetic consciousness and affectivity. This suggests that functional amnesia is a multifaceted condition. We hypothesize that the recollection deficit in functional retrograde amnesia primarily reflects a desynchronization between a frontal lobe system, important for autonoetic consciousness, and a temporo-amygdalar system, important for evaluation and emotions. Despite assumptions that functional amnesia can always be reversed, several cases of functional amnesia were found to follow a chronic course, suggesting a need for longitudinal prospective studies to quantify possible global cognitive deterioration over time and its neural underpinnings.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.05.020,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Although only a few cases are reported in the literature, ScA occlusion has been well described for both noniatrogenic and iatrogenic causes. Several cases of iatrogenic injuries have been reported after AcoA aneurysm clipping or, less frequently, after embolization. A 43-year-old man was admitted for a subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to the rupture of a right high-flow anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm related to a right frontobasal arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The aneurysm was treated early by endovascular embolization. At discharge, the patient was Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1. Five months later, the AVM was treated endovascularly in 3 sessions. The last session was performed through a median branch of the right A2 segment of the ACA, allowing an 80% AVM exclusion. However, the patient woke up with anterograde memory impairment and confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging showed infarction of both anterior columns of the fornix. The clinical condition of the patient 3 years after stroke has improved. Bilateral anterior fornix infarction leading to amnestic syndrome is encountered in ScA stroke.

A qualitative analysis of clinical situations could highlight the relevance of psychotherapy care. In January 2005, this 24-year-old patient sustained severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow at 4/15), with bilateral frontotemporal injury and temporal extradural hematoma. On the third day, a temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient's evolution showed severe neurobehavioral disorders, with agitation and aggressive behavior towards family members and medical caregivers. Maximum doses of antipsychotic drugs brought no improvement. Antidepressant medication improved social contact. Several stays in the psychiatric unit, where institutionalized and psychotherapy care were implemented, showed systematically a real improvement of the behavioral disorders, increased participation in group activities and the ability to walk around alone in a closed environment. Aggressive behavior can unveil organic brain injuries, depressive syndrome as well as iatrogenic nature of the environment. This clinical case is based on the fact that antipsychotic drugs, aside from their sedative effect, are not the proper treatment for agitation following traumatic brain injury. This case also highlights how management of behavioral disorders following TBI should not be based on pharmacological treatments only but instead should focus on multidisciplinary strategies of care.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,10.1016/j.rehab.2011.04.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng; fre

11865559,[Post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome: clinical and anatomical report].,"Brion, S; Plas, J; Mikol, J; Jeanneau, A; Brion, F",Brion,"Clinical and anatomical report of a post traumatic amnestic syndrome (Korsakoff's syndrome), associating anterograde amnesia persisting for fifteen years, with temporal disorientation, false recognitions, initially intense transitory confabulation and secondarily bursts of confabulation, intact remote memory and persistence of old learnings. Death after twelve years from mesenteric infarction. Anatomically, post-traumatic sequellae are limited to both cingulate gyri in their anterior part. This cingula involvement is easy to understand if one knows that post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome appears after severe cranial traumatisms, with at least three days of coma, and develops constantly, even if transitory, after long duration comas with 20 to 30 days of loss of consciousness. Anatomical explanation depends on the fact that Korsakoff's syndromes from various etiologies need, to be produced, a bilateral damage of the limbic circuit and that severe head traumatisms, when dying early in the evolution without possibility of a neuro-psychological investigation, have always a destruction of corpus callosum or cingulate gyri or both, resulting from crushing of these structures by the edge of the faulx cerebri. Consistent with these constatations, it is logical that a Korsakoff's syndrome develops after severe head traumas with bilateral lesions of the limbic circuit and especially of the cingulate gyri. But anatomical evidence remains rare, because early fatal evolution does not permit psychological evaluation and, reversely, long survivals who may die from another pathology would not have brain examination. We prefer the name of ""Korsakoff's syndrome"" rather than that of ""amnesic syndrome"" to denominate the anterograd amnesia (amnésie des faits récents) encountered in nutritional disorders due to B1 deficiency in true Korsakoff's disease, but also with other etiologies such as cerebral tumours, vascular cerebral disorders, post-commital anoxia, herpetic encephalopathy, head traumas, all of them developing amnesia for recent events, formerly classified under the title of ""korsakowian syndrome"" or ""mental syndrome of Korsakoff"" and more recently under the denomination of ""amnesic syndrome"". But whatever is the etiology of the memory disorder, the amnesic syndrome remains identical and the advanced small differences, such as euphoria in alcoholics or mood depression in tumours, are often fallacious, so that the only way of differentiation deals with accessory symptoms such as intracranial hypertension in tumours, sudden onset in vascular etiologies or polyneuritis in B1 deficiency. Post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome joins with this scheme, for its clinical aspect is so similar to that of nutritional disorders that it might be difficult to reach the exact diagnosis when an alcohol addict develops, after a head trauma, an amnesia which could be the consequence of the trauma but also of a nutritional disorder developed after the accident with inadequate parenteral treatment. Our case, which is the first well documented observation of this disease reported with long clinical survey and final pathological examination, was presented in 1981 at a joint meeting of the French and Dutch neurological societies. It gives the proof of the importance, in limbic circuit, of the cingulate gyri. A comparison is made with four other clinical cases of post traumatic amnestic syndrome with MNR procedures which show, for two of them, cingula lesions explaining the clinical features, for one of them a bilateral lesion of Ammon's homs and for the last one extra-limbic lesions, with destruction of the inferior part of both frontal lobes, associated with a possible deafferentation of the right cingula cortex.",{},,L'Encephale,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Six new cases and a review of the literature.,"Ott, B R; Saver, J L",Ott,"Although persistent amnesia due to bilateral limbic system infarction is well described, reports of amnesic syndromes due to unilateral stroke have appeared infrequently and unsystematically. We report six new cases and review previously published reports to expand and consolidate knowledge regarding amnesic stroke. Six patients developed acute amnesia associated with unilateral stroke. Brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions in limbic structures, which accounted for the memory deficit. Based on these as well as similar cases in the literature, we delineate three distinct syndromes of unilateral amnesic stroke involving the territories of the posterior cerebral, anterior choroidal, and thalamic penetrating arteries. Eighty-five percent of reported cases have involved the left hemisphere. Persistent as well as transient amnesia may be the sole or primary manifestation of unilateral hemispheric stroke. The vascular mechanisms of amnesic stroke are diverse. Patients presenting with acute amnesia possibly related to cerebral ischemia should be classified by documented or presumed lesion site as well as the involved vascular territory.

Amnesia was anterograde in three cases (13%) and global in the remaining 20 (87%). The infarct was detected in neuroimaging studies carried out within the first 24 hours in one patient (4%) and later in all the others; the average time until a diagnosis was established was 11 days. The initial CT scan was normal in five patients (22%). Eight cases (35%) required magnetic resonance imaging to detect the infarct. Of these, four subjects were studied directly with MR imaging. Amnesia clearly improved in eight patients (35%), and three of them (13%) made a full recovery. Fifteen patients (65%) presented mnemonic sequelae that interfered with their functional capacity.

Transient global amnesia is characterized by a sudden onset of anterograde amnesia that disappears within 24 hours. The cause of transient global amnesia is still uncertain. Some studies with MRI showed small lesions in the hippocampus at 24-74 hours after the episode. These lesions disappear within several weeks. However, our case of transient global amnesia showed a small lesion in the left putamen, not the hippocampus.

Unlike gradual drug-induced parkinsonism, our patient experienced acute extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS), reaching significant motor and sphincter disability in just a few days, followed by a gradual incomplete recovery over more than six months. In fact, after drug discontinuation, hypomimia and slight left hemi-somatic rigidity with bradykinesia remained, as well as stable non-progressive memory disturbances. Despite bio-humoral and instrumental investigations and DaTScan were negative, MRI post-analysis evidenced a 6.5% loss in brain volume. Specifically, irreversible cortical and sub-cortical grey matter reduction and cerebrospinal fluid space enlargement with spared white matter were found. Our observations suggest that the sudden availability of Fluphenazine results in a kind of plateau effect of parkinsonism presentation, partially reversible due to the neurotoxic drug effect on the cortical and sub-cortical grey matter, resulting in asymmetric EPS and stable memory loss, respectively. Our report confirms the debated neurotoxicity of first-generation neuroleptics and the postulated theory of differential susceptibility to the cytotoxic stressors on the central nervous system.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms24032968,PMC9917624,Fluphenazine; extrapyramidal syndrome; memory loss; neuroleptics; neurotoxicity; parkinsonism,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The patient lost consciousness and experienced post-traumatic amnesia for ∼1minute from the time of the car-accident. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15. No specific lesion was observed on brain MRI. At 2 weeks after onset, the patient began to show resting and intentional tremor (more severe in the right upper and lower extremities) and ataxic gait. Her symptoms had been aggravated with the passage of time. On 1-month DTT, the left DRTT, which originated from the left dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, was thinner than the right DRTT.

In M.B. confabulation was restricted to episodic memory tasks, whereas in S.D. it also affected the retrieval of semantic information.

Further investigation using the encoding specificity paradigm showed an interaction of encoding/retrieval conditions in M.B. but not in S.D.

Abulia is most frequently associated with ACC damage, but also occurs following damage to subcortical nuclei (striatum, globus pallidus, thalamic nuclei). We present resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data from an individual who suffered a stroke leading to abulia. We hypothesized that, although structural imaging revealed no damage to the patient's ACC, fcMRI would uncover aberrant function in this region and in the relevant cortical networks. Resting state correlations in the patient's gray matter were compared to those of age-matched controls. Using a novel method to identify abnormal patterns of functional connectivity in single subjects, we identified areas and networks with aberrant connectivity. Networks associated with memory (default mode network) and executive function (cingulo-opercular network) were abnormal. The patient's anterior cingulate was among the areas showing aberrant functional connectivity. In a rescan 3 years later, deficits remained stable and fcMRI findings were replicated. These findings suggest that the aberrant functional connectivity mapping approach described may be useful for linking stroke symptoms to disrupted network connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,NeuroImage.

In contrast, memory for faces appeared unimpaired. One month later the patient's behaviour, orientation and spatial memory had improved with no concomitant improvement in auditory-verbal memory. The findings indicate that injury to the diencephalon manifests in a verbal amnesic syndrome that is anterograde in nature if localized in the region of the anterior left thalamus, but leaves a relatively intact visual memory.

As part of this mental re-enactment, the past is recognized relative to the present. Dysfunction of this memory system may lead to confusion regarding the present perception of time. Two Japanese women (42 and 55 years old) temporarily believed they were living in their past during a course of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Their autobiographical memories and behaviour reflected their self-estimated age, and they could not recall memories experienced beyond that age. More surprisingly, their subjective age estimations and autobiographical memories were transiently corrected when they were made aware of their true age. Disorientation, anterograde amnesia, and retrograde amnesia were common additional symptoms. Neuroimaging suggested disturbances in medial temporal and orbitofrontal brain regions in both cases. This syndrome is characterized by three elements: 1) failure to subjectively recognize the present; 2) inability to suppress irrelevant past memories; and 3) transient restitution of awareness of the present through realization of the individual's true age. We defined this syndrome as 'autobiographical age awareness disturbance', and focused our investigation on the role of age self-awareness. If recall of relevant and suppression of irrelevant past memories are both necessary to subjectively recognize the present relative to the past, dysfunction of medial temporal and orbitofrontal brain regions is predicted to lead to abnormal subjective placement in time. However, the subjective experience of age tends to be an important informational component for retrieving remote autobiographical memories. This suggests that correct age awareness is essential for the proper recognition of the remote past in relation to the present. This is the first report to focus on the relationship between subjective temporal orientation and age self-awareness. While the role of age awareness in this process is still unclear, investigating autobiographical age awareness disturbance as a part of subjective temporal awareness dysfunction can be useful in understanding the processes underlying human time recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-015-0498-7,PMC4654801,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Positron emission tomography scan demonstrated decreased metabolic activity in the ipsilateral temporal, occipitotemporal, and contralateral cerebellar hemispheres. Electroencephalography showed intermittent rhythmic delta activity in the left frontotemporal region, and findings on neuropsychometric evaluation were consistent with cognitive impairment. Follow up evaluation 7 months after the stroke showed improvement in some areas of the cognitive domain, but residual neuropsychometric and neurophysiological abnormalities persisted. This case illustrates that cerebral and cerebellar diaschisis may contribute to the symptomatic presentation and recovery from capsular genu infarct, although its precise role remains elusive.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.71.5.658,PMC1737596,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

In previously reported cases of amnesia associated with damage in the basal forebrain, multiple neuroanatomical regions were damaged, and the critical lesion responsible for amnesia has not been identified clearly. We report a patient who developed primarily anterograde amnesia after clipping of an unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed a discrete lesion, centering in the right diagonal band of Broca and including the anterior hypothalamus, septal nucleus, lamina terminalis, and paraterminal gyrus, and an indiscrete patchy lesion in the corresponding area on the opposite side. The nucleus basalis of Meynert was minimally affected and the diencephalon was not damaged. Single photon emission computed tomography showed marked hypoperfusion in the midline frontobasal region corresponding to the MRI lesion and hypoperfusion in the hippocampus bilaterally. It is concluded that disconnection of the pathway between the diagonal band of Broca and the hippocampus contributed to memory impairment.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.65.1.126,PMC2170148,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The patient underwent a left temporal lobectomy in 1980. After surgery, he presented with severe retrograde amnesia and complete loss of musical interest and capabilities. The patient's musical abilities recovered over time, and he regained his previous virtuoso status. In 2007, his medical history, neuropsychologic functions, and structural magnetic resonance imaging study were examined and revealed a remarkable degree of recovery of memory and musical abilities in the context of extensive temporal lobe resection. The neuropsychologic findings and neuroanatomic features of the magnetic resonance imaging study were analyzed to try to understand the high degree of recovery of both long-term memory and musical processing abilities in this musician. This case reveals the possibility of an unusual degree of cerebral plasticity and reorganization. Additionally, it emphasizes the question of musical virtuosity. This report shows that the musical capabilities of professional musicians, in specific cases, can completely recover even when much of the left temporal lobe has been removed.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2013.09.042,,Amnesia; Amygdala; Auditory-motor interrelations; Brain; Brain plasticity; Cerebral arteriovenous malformation; Epilepsy; Hippocampus; Memory; Music; Neurologic deficit; Neuropsychologic assessment; Neuroscience; Temporal lobe,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Cerebral infarctions were also found in the left thalamus, body of the left caudate nucleus, and the left occipital lobe other than the fornix. Occlusion of the subcallosal artery results in cerebral infarction of fornix, anterior cingulate cortex, and genu of the corpus callosum. However, in our case, lesions were restricted to the territory of posterior circulation. In addition to subcallosal artery, lateral posterior choroidal artery, a perforating branch of the posterior cerebral artery, has been described to send branches to the fornix, so we speculated that the left lateral posterior choroidal artery was actually responsible for fornix infarction.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.03.030,,Vertebral artery dissection; amnesia; cerebral embolism; fornix infarction; lateral posterior choroidal artery; posterior circulation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Observation and neuropsychological study showed visuospatial impairment, visual-dominant memory disturbance, anosognosia for cognitive disturbance, and mild frontal dysfunction with paranoid personality. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging study showed a lesion localized in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area, and we could define 5 neural pathways involved with the lesion. We supposed that 4 of these were potentially related to reduplicative paramnesia: the medial inferior component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, which are related to visuospatial processing; the anterior thalamic radiation, which is concerned with memory processes; and the uncinate fasciculus, which may be related to abnormal feelings of hyperfamiliarity. A localized lesion in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area can cause cognitive dysfunction that may develop into reduplicative paramnesia.

While infarction of its vascular territory can result in a wide range of symptoms, paramedian thalamic syndrome is classically described as a triad of symptoms including vertical gaze disturbances, fluctuating level of consciousness, and amnesia. There is minimal evidence to date to characterize the long-term cognitive consequences of infarction of the artery of Percheron utilizing neuropsychological assessment. We describe a 40-year-old female patient initially presenting with dizziness, confusion and falls with unremarkable head CT scans. Subsequent MRI, more than 24 h after symptom onset, identified evidence of bilateral thalamic and rostral midbrain infarction. Neuropsychological testing was administered at 4 months post-stroke, with follow up testing at 1 year. The patient was found to have profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, which did not change significantly over the first year of rehabilitation, and which was not easily identifiable in everyday encounters due to her relatively intact working memory and social skills. As early diagnosis of infarction of the artery of Percheron is challenging, patients have frequently missed the time window for acute management of ischemic stroke. Moreover, this case study highlights the need for further research in deciphering the role of the paramedian thalamus in memory and cognition, as well as the importance of standardized neuropsychological testing for the artery of Percheron stroke patients to identify safety and rehabilitation concerns that may be overlooked.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01949-0,PMC7545865,Anterograde and retrograde amnesia; Artery of Percheron; Neuropsychological assessment; Paramedian thalamus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

All three patients exhibited a similar phenotype of amnesia with markedly impaired declarative memory (anterograde and retrograde) but normal performance on tests of nondeclarative memory (e.g., priming and adaptation-level effects) as well as on tests of other cognitive functions. Patient NC had damage to the hippocampus (dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 fields) and layer III of the entorhinal cortex, but with relative sparing of the CA2 field and the subiculum. Patient MG had damage to the internal medullary lamina and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. Patient PN had damage to the mammillary nuclei, mammillothalamic tracts, and the anterior thalamic nuclei.

Self trait knowledge, which is considered one of the more abstract types of autobiographical memory, is thought to rely on regions of the autobiographical memory neural network implicated in schema representation, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and critically, not the medial temporal lobes. The current case study introduces an individual who experienced bilateral posterior cerebral artery strokes resulting in extensive medial temporal lobe damage with sparing of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, in addition to severe retrograde and anterograde episodic and autobiographical fact amnesia, this individual's self trait knowledge was impaired for his current and pre-morbid personality traits. Yet, further assessment revealed that this individual had preserved conceptual knowledge for personality traits, could reliably and accurately rate another person's traits, and could access his own self-concept in a variety of ways. In addition to autobiographical memory loss, he demonstrated impairment on non-personal semantic memory tests, most notably on tests requiring retrieval of unique knowledge. This rare case of amnesia suggests a previously unreported role for the medial temporal lobes in self trait knowledge, which we propose reflects the critical role of this neural region in the storage and retrieval of personal semantics that are experience-near, meaning autobiographical facts grounded in spatiotemporal contexts.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.11.013,,Amnesia; Autobiographical memory; Medial temporal lobe; Personality traits; Semantic memory,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

This case confirms that unilateral destruction of the posterior commissure, rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF and interstitial nucleus of Cajal produces a non-dissociated upgaze palsy. Involvement of the nucleus of Cajal probably produced the sustained downward deviation of the eye, by causing predominance of downward vestibulo-ocular inputs.

M.L. is densely amnesic for experiences predating his injury, but shows normal anterograde memory performance on a variety of standard tests of recall and recognition. The cognitive processes underlying this performance were examined with the remember/know technique, which permits separation of episodic from non-episodic contributions to memory tests by quantifying subjects' reports of re-experiencing aspects of the encoding episode. The results demonstrated that M.L. does not episodically re-experience post-injury events to the same extent as control subjects, although he can use familiarity or other non-episodic processes to distinguish events he has experienced from those he has not experienced. M.L.'s MRI showed damage to the right ventral frontal cortex and underlying white matter, including the uncinate fasciculus, a frontotemporal band of fibres previously hypothesized to mediate retrieval of specific events from one's personal past. Recent functional neuroimaging evidence of an association between right frontal lobe functioning and episodic retrieval demands suggest that M.L.'s memory deficits are related to this focal injury. This hypothesis was supported by right frontal polar hypoactivation in M.L. in response to episodic retrieval demands when he was examined with a cognitive activation H2(15)O PET paradigm that reliably activated this frontal region in both healthy controls and patients with TBI carefully matched to M.L. (but without isolated retrograde amnesia). He also showed increased left inferomedial temporal activation relative to control subjects, suggesting that his spared anterograde memory is mediated through increased reliance on medial temporal lobe structures. Re-experiencing events as part of one's past is based on autonoetic awareness, i.e. awareness of oneself as a continuous entity across time. This form of awareness also supports the formulation of future goals and the implementation of a behavioural guidance system to achieve them. The findings from this study converge to suggest that M.L. has impaired autonoetic awareness attributable to right ventral frontal lobe injury, including right frontal-temporal disconnection. Reorganized brain systems mediate certain preserved cognitive operations in M.L., but without the normal complement of information concerning the self with respect to both past and future events.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/121.10.1951,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We aimed to probe further distinctions between detailed and schematic representations of familiar environments in three cases of hippocampal/medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia by testing them on a route description task and mental navigation tasks that assess the identity and location of landmarks, and distances and directions between them. The amnesic cases could describe basic directions along known, imagined routes, estimate distance and direction between well-known landmarks, and produce sketch maps with accurate layouts, suggestive of intact schematic representations. However, findings that their route descriptions lack richness of detail, along with impoverished sketch maps and poor landmark recognition, substantiates previous findings that detailed representations are hippocampus-dependent.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.06.008,,Case study method; Episodic memory; Hippocampus; Navigation; Spatial memory,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

The purpose of the current research was to explore the potential means and utility of assessing cognitive communication during PTA and the post-acute recovery period. This research used a longitudinal mixed methods design to describe language and cognitive communication assessment and recovery profiles of three patients with TBI. Cognitive communication was assessed with repeated standardised and non-standardised methods during PTA (rated with Westmead PTA Scale) and at follow-up 3 months after PTA emergence. All participants demonstrated a profile of language and cognitive communication strengths and weaknesses during PTA and the post-acute period, also evident at follow-up. Improvement occurred gradually throughout PTA, although with individual fluctuation across test occasions. There was no marked change in communication function immediately before and after PTA emergence, indicating that cognitive communication ability and those functions measured on the Westmead PTA Scale (memory and orientation) did not recover at the same rate. It was feasible to assess language and cognitive communication throughout PTA and the post-acute period, and early assessment results were relevant to the patient's ongoing communicative function. It is suggested that early and repeated SLP assessment may contribute to the prediction of persisting cognitive communication issues.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2017.1373200,,Cognitive communication; assessment; post-traumatic amnesia; speech-language pathology; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Memory for a significant event was improved substantially when tested after 4.5 weeks, if the patient viewed SenseCam images of the event every 2 days for 3 weeks. In contrast, after only 3.5 weeks, her memory was at chance levels for a similarly significant event which was reviewed equally often, but using a written diary. During the fMRI scan, the patient viewed images of these two events, plus images of an unrehearsed event and images from a novel ""control"" event that she had never experienced. There was no difference in behavioural responses or in activation when the unrehearsed and novel conditions were compared. Relative to the written-rehearsed condition, successful recognition of the images in the SenseCam-rehearsed condition was associated with activation of frontal and posterior cortical regions associated with normal episodic memory. SenseCam images may provide powerful cues that trigger the recall and consolidation of stored but inaccessible memories.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2008.164251,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Despite the potential morbidity of surgical treatment, the possibility of catastrophic, spontaneous hemorrhage in this location is even more feared and aggressive treatment is warranted, especially if the patient had suffered previous hemorrhages and is currently symptomatic. We demonstrate this approach (Video 1) on a 16-year-old boy who presented with right-sided hemiparesis (power grade 4), intense headaches, difficulties with learning and concentration, and memory loss, mainly affecting short-term memory. The patient had a previous unsuccessful excision at another center 3 months after initial hemorrhage. The absence of hydrocephalus and medial thalamic location favored a modified transcallosal transchoroidal (or subchoroidal) approach. Due to the anatomy of the lesion, no other microsurgical approaches were considered. The surgery at our center (second attempt) was performed 5 months after initial hemorrhage. The head was placed in neutral position, with a slight elevation of the vertex and the midline in a vertical position. A callosotomy had already been performed during the patient's first excision attempt at another center. Although dissection through the tela choroidea is commonly performed medially to the choroidal fissure when one wants to enter the third ventricle, we chose to carefully dissect through this structure laterally, because this thalamic lesion extended almost into the ependymal surface of the third ventricle. This way, the choroidal plexus became a protective cushion for the fornix. On entering the third ventricle, a mulberry-like lesion was readily identified and the cavernoma was located. The central contents of the cavernoma were dissected initially, causing relative deflation of the lesion and more maneuverability to dissect it away from the surrounding structures. Neuromonitoring was used to avoid brainstem injury. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed complete resection with no signs of hemorrhage or ischemia. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with no new neurologic deficits. The patient was also able to return to school after 1 month and showed complete recovery. Unfortunately, neuropsychologic evaluation was unavailable to understand his improvement better.

A sudden attack of TGA with a rather typical clinical presentation--anterograde amnesia with selective retrograde features that lasted for a few hours, with stereotypic questions, no associated symptoms or neurological impairment, and no recurrence--occurred while she was at home; this was witnessed by her husband. The neurological examination was unremarkable, with the exception of a slight left homonymous superior quadrantonopia. Brain imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) showed a huge meningioma originating from the right tentorium, extending from the cerebellar hemisphere to the midst of the temporal lobe. An electroencephalogram did not reveal temporal spikes. The tumor was completely excised, and she has remained asymptomatic for 6 months.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report to describe a hippocampal infarction associated with a drug overdose. A 64-year-old Japanese woman was brought to our emergency department after ingestion of an unknown dose of glyphosate surfactant herbicide in order to attempt suicide. On admission, she was assumed to be presenting with depression or psychiatric illness, however, sudden-onset memory deficit became apparent. The patient manifested delirium, confusion, and severe anxiety. In addition, short-term memory loss was prominent, with the patient forgetting her attempted suicide. Following an array of standard tests and a brain computed tomography scan (which only showed an old infraction), we performed a magnetic resonance imaging scan and neuropsychological evaluations. The brain magnetic resonance image revealed a small high-intensity lesion in the dorsal part of the left hippocampal body, and memory tests demonstrated severe short-term recall deficits. We diagnosed her with a left hippocampal infarction and administered a course of 75mg of clopidogrel. She gradually became less confused over the course of a week, and a follow-up memory test revealed partial improvement in some domains. No abnormalities were found on a follow-up brain scan. However, despite rehabilitation, memory impairments remain. It is important to note that had the symptom of short-term memory been absent or less severe, she might have been misdiagnosed with depression or another psychiatric illness. Although a computed tomography scan failed to detect hippocampal lesions, a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan clearly revealed a lesion within the left hippocampus. Therefore, in addition to assessments focusing on psychiatric illnesses that might be the root cause of an attempted suicide, organic factors should be considered along with radiological examination and precise memory assessments for diagnosing similar cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/1752-1947-8-219,PMC4088294,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Severe anterograde global amnesia, mild retrograde amnesia, momentary and spontaneous confabulation, and mild executive deficits were found initially and mostly recovered by 17 months. The authors hypothesize that the lesion of the right fornix was sufficient to cause amnesia by disconnecting the hippocampal formations from the anterior thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies and interrupting the cholinergic efferents to the hippocampus from the medial septum, according to the extended hippocampal system framework. Sparing of the left fornix may be sufficient to ensure a good recovery of memory.

In the absence of detectable brain lesions, a differentiation of FRA from psychogenic causes is difficult. Here we report a case study of persisting FRA after an epileptic seizure. A thorough neuropsychological assessment confirmed severe retrograde memory deficits while anterograde memory abilities were completely normal. Neurological and psychiatric examination were unremarkable and high-resolution MRI showed no neuroradiologically apparent lesion. However, voxel-based morphometry (VBM)-comparing the MRI to an education-, age-and sex-matched control group (n = 20) disclosed distinct gray matter decreases in left temporopolar cortex and a region between right posterior parahippocampal and lingual cortex. Although the results of VBM-based comparisons between a single case and a healthy control group are generally susceptible to differences unrelated to the specific symptoms of the case, we believe that our data suggest a causal role of the cortical areas detected since the retrograde memory deficit is the preeminent neuropsychological difference between patient and controls. This was paralleled by grey matter differences in central nodes of the retrograde memory network. We therefore suggest that these subtle alterations represent structural correlates of the focal retrograde amnesia in our patient. Beyond the implications for the diagnosis and etiology of FRA, our results advocate the use of VBM in conditions that do not show abnormalities in clinical radiological assessment, but show distinct neuropsychological deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0026538,PMC3197527,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to estimate the contribution of recollection and familiarity to recognition performance on the experimental tests. RH had preserved verbal recognition memory. Interestingly, her face recognition memory was also spared, whilst topographical recognition memory was impaired. JC was impaired for all types of verbal and non-verbal materials. In both patients, deficits in recollection were invariably associated with deficits in familiarity. JC's data demonstrate the need for a comprehensive cognitive investigation in patients with apparently selective hippocampal damage following anoxia. The data from RH suggest that the right hippocampus is necessary for recollection and familiarity for topographical materials, whilst the left hippocampus is sufficient to underpin these processes for at least some types of verbal materials. Face recognition memory may be adequately subserved by areas outside of the hippocampus.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.011,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The acute syndrome featured fluctuating alertness, inattention, memory loss, apathy, abulia, and psychomotor retardation, suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. Contralateral hemiparesis and dysarthria were generally mild, except when the infarct extended into the posterior limb. Neuropsychological testing in five patients with left-sided infarcts revealed severe verbal memory loss. Additional cognitive deficits consistent with dementia occurred in four patients. A right-sided infarct caused transient impairment in visuospatial memory. Functional brain imaging in three patients showed a focal reduction in hemispheric perfusion most prominent in the ipsilateral inferior and medial frontal cortex. We infer that the capsular genu infarct interrupted the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles, resulting in functional deactivation of the ipsilateral frontal cortex. These observations suggest that one mechanism for cognitive deterioration from a lacunar infarct is thalamocortical disconnection of white-matter tracts, in some instances leading to ""strategic-infarct dementia.""",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.42.10.1966,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Although several prior case studies have described outcome following acute onset of HSVE, this case presents a unique challenge for rehabilitation in several respects. First, EB's pre-morbid history is complicated; in contrast with prior HSVE case studies that have typically involved individuals with a relatively high level of pre-morbid functioning, EB presents with limited educational attainment and a prior history of several incarcerations for violent offenses. Post-injury, his presentation includes significant verbal aggression, threats of harm toward others, physical posturing and occasional physical aggression toward his caretakers. Third, EB presents with a fixed delusion that others are constantly taking advantage of him. These features are present in the context of global amnesia and relatively intact cognitive functioning in other domains. Following a brief review of prior HSVE case studies, this study reviews the outcomes of various pharmacological, cognitive, behavioural and integrative interventions designed for management of EB's aggression and agitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2014.954623,,Aggression; amnesia; encephalitis; neuropsychological; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In contrast, he was unable to recognize a single stimulus after it was presented 40 times in succession. These findings demonstrate that the ability to classify novel items, after experience with other items in the same category, is a separate and parallel memory function of the brain, independent of the limbic and diencephalic structures essential for remembering individual stimulus items (declarative memory). Category-level knowledge can be acquired implicitly by cumulating information from multiple training examples in the absence of detectable conscious memory for the examples themselves.",{},,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.92.26.12470,PMC40379,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Recently, a combination of ventrolateral prefrontal and temporopolar cortical lesions has been suggested as the cause of such isolated or focal retrograde amnesia. It is also assumed that when the right-sided cortical structures are damaged, autobiographical episodic memories are affected. To search for new anatomic substrates for focal retrograde amnesia. We performed extensive neuropsychological tests and obtained detailed neuroimages on a 43-year-old woman who showed a severe, persistent retrograde amnesia but only a limited anterograde amnesia after probable herpes simplex encephalitis. Tests of autobiographical memory revealed that she had a memory loss extending back to her childhood for both semantics and incidents; however, the ability to recall specific episodes appeared much more severely impaired than the ability to recall factual information about her past. The patient also showed profound impairments in recalling public memories; however, her scores improved nearly to a control level on forced-choice recognition memory tasks, although the recall of memories for a decade just before her illness remained mildly impaired. MRI revealed focal pathologies in the temporal poles and the anterior parts of the inferotemporal lobes on both sides, predominantly on the left, with some extension to the anterior parts of the medial temporal lobes. There was additional damage to the left insular cortex and its surrounding structures but no evidence of frontal lobe damage on MRIs or cognitive tests. A profound retrograde amnesia may be produced by damage to the bilateral temporal poles and anterior inferotemporal lobes in the absence of frontal lobe pathologies, and a dense and persistent episodic old memory loss can arise even with a relatively small lesion in the right anterior temporal lobe if it is combined with extensive damage to the left.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.53.2.344,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Detailed memory testing showed marked anterograde memory impairment, but only mild, temporally-limited retrograde amnesia that covered a period of several years in both autobiographical and factual knowledge domains. The absence of extensive retrograde amnesia in these two cases points to a time-limited role for the hippocampus in the retrieval of retrograde memories, and suggests that entorhinal, perirhinal, parahippocampal, or neocortical areas of the temporal lobe may be more critical than the hippocampus proper for long-term retrograde memory functioning.

The patient was in the normal or slightly subnormal range for all tested anterograde memory functions, but manifested severe retrograde memory deficits with respect to episodic old memories and more moderate deficits in tests of general knowledge (semantic old memories). It is concluded that the ecphory of old autobiographical memories relies heavily on an activation of the right lateral temporofrontal junction area, but that probably only some complementary left hemispheric damage to these regions will lead to major and persistent retrograde amnesia.

Localisation of the lesion was confirmed by MRI scanning. From the localisation of the lesion it was concluded that damage has been inflicted on the hippocampal pathway, the amygdalar pathway, and the pathway from perirhinal cortex to the dorso-medial thalamic nucleus. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed a severe verbal memory deficit on anterograde tests comparable with that shown by alcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff patients. In contrast performance on non-verbal memory measures was normal. Performance on retrograde amnesia tests indicated near-normal performance. A final finding was that memory for temporal information was impaired for both verbal and non-verbal information but only on anterograde tests. The data provide support for the view that a lesion in the anterior thalamus can produce amnesia if it compromises the hippocampal pathway and either the amygdalar pathway or that arising from the perirhinal cortex and terminating in the dorso-medial nucleus of the thalamus. On the basis of evidence from other studies it is concluded that the most likely interpretation is that the lesion must compromise the hippocampal and perirhinal cortex pathways.

Patients in the first group tend to have attacks at an earlier age and to have an increased recurrence rate but, like those in the second group, have a good prognosis. Patients in the third group often have onset later in life, and as many as 10% may have a stroke or dementia.

The amnesia primarily affects verbal material and occurs in the absence of other detectable cognitive deficits. Previous CT scans demonstrated a lucency in the region of the left mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, but no additional damage was revealed. Beginning in 1986 when he was 48 years old, N.A. was evaluated with a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) studies. Three major areas of damage were identified. In the left thalamus there is a prominent 3- to 4-mm-wide linear lesion that approximates the position and orientation of the internal medullary lamina. The defect extends for approximately 20 mm anteroposteriorly and likely involves the rostral group of intralaminar nuclei (central medial, paracentral, central lateral, rhomboid, and reuniens nuclei), the caudal group of intralaminar nuclei (centrum medianum and parafascicular nuclei), the ventral aspect of the mediodorsal nucleus, and the ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei. It also likely interrupts the trajectories of the mammillothalamic tract and postcommissural fornix. The posterior hypothalamus is markedly disrupted and the mammillary nuclei appear to be missing bilaterally. Finally, the right anterior temporal lobe is damaged for a distance of about 3.5 cm from the pole to midway through the amygdaloid complex. This damage probably occurred during exploratory neurosurgery done at the time of N.A.'s injury. The hippocampal formation appears intact on both sides. A comparison of these findings with those from other patients with diencephalic amnesia suggests that amnesia can result when several diencephalic structures are damaged conjointly, including the internal medullary lamina, the intralaminar nuclei, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the mammillothalamic tract.

More interestingly, relative to noise and unfamiliar voices, the familiar voices elicited greater haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus and medial parietal regions including the dorsal pCG and precuneus. The findings are consistent with theories implicating the pCG in recognizing people who are personally familiar, and furthermore suggest that the pCG region of the voice identification network is able to make functional contributions to voice recognition even though other areas of the network, namely the anterior temporal poles, FFA, and the right parietal lobe, may be compromised.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x246131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

If this is the case, then it should be possible to find frontal patients with selective deficits to these processes. However, most laboratory based memory tests (e.g. Wechsler Memory Scale) require a combination of all these processes making it hard to find clear dissociations between patients. Using tests of everyday memory, this study documents a clear dissociation between a frontal patient's (JB) impaired ability to retrieve events from the anterograde period relative to spared ability to retrieve events from the retrograde period. This is consistent with specific disruption to frontal mechanisms associated with encoding which disrupts the formation of new episodic memories. The defective mechanism may be related to more general aspects of cognitive processing (e.g. selection demands), but it is unlikely to reflect damage to working memory (as assessed by the n-back task) as there is a clear dissociation between spared performance on this task and impaired performance on a comparable episodic recognition memory task.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70864-5,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

1486463,Amnesia following a discrete basal forebrain lesion.,"Morris, M K; Bowers, D; Chatterjee, A; Heilman, K M",Morris,"Destructive lesions of the basal forebrain are associated with memory impairment in both humans and experimental animals. The basal forebrain is thought to contribute to memory function by providing cholinergic innervation to critical memory structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala. In previously reported clinical cases of basal forebrain amnesia, multiple neuroanatomical regions have been damaged, preventing identification of the minimal critical lesion necessary to produce an amnestic syndrome. We describe a patient who developed persistent, global anterograde and retrograde amnesia following resection of a low-grade glioma. Post-surgical magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed a small discrete lesion, centred in the right diagonal band of Broca, that included the preoptic area, the anterior hypothalamus, the lamina terminalis and the paraterminal gyrus. The septal nuclei and the cell bodies of the nucleus basalis of Meynert appeared to have been spared, as were other structures in the medial temporal lobe and diencephalon. Our case provides critical support for the independent contribution of the basal forebrain, in particular the diagonal band nuclei, in memory function. We propose that our patient's amnesia resulted from disconnection of pathways between the diagonal band nuclei and the hippocampal region, depriving the hippocampus of cholinergic innervation.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/115.6.1827,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

Patients Three patients diagnosed as having VGKC-Ab-associated encephalitis underwent cognitive testing before and after immunotherapy. In addition to standard neuropsychological tests, retrograde memory was assessed using 2 novel tests. Memory for past newsworthy events was assessed using a public events test; test material was divided into epochs of 5 years and spanned approximately 25 years. This was complemented by a famous faces test in which patients were required to identify individuals from the recent and remote past. All 3 patients were found to have temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia dating back more than 20 years. Magnetic resonance imaging in all patients revealed high-signal abnormalities predominantly affecting the hippocampi. Subsequent testing performed after immunotherapy revealed subjective improvement but no evidence of a temporal gradient in the recovery of past memories. Encephalitis associated with VGKC-Ab results in extensive and temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia that is partially reversible with immunotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging high-signal abnormalities were primarily restricted to the hippocampi. These data are supportive of theories postulating a role for the hippocampus in the storage and retrieval of all past memories, irrespective of age, rather than theories of memory consolidation that propose an involvement of the hippocampus only in the temporary storage of memories.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.64.3.404,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

His performance on standard episodic memory tests, and on measures of retrograde amnesia, including autobiographical memory, was severely impaired. When presented with passages from plays he had not appeared in, AB showed a severe impairment at the first learning trial, but thereafter showed a 'normal' learning curve for this semantically and syntactically complex material. On being presented with passages from plays he had performed in the past, AB did not show any recognition of them whatsoever, as one might expect from his severe episodic memory impairment. However, AB showed a striking benefit (savings score) in relearning passages he had previously performed, compared with new passages, despite not having any autobiographical recall of having performed the relearned passages before. Moreover, although his initial recall performance in learning these passages was impaired compared with healthy control actors of similar age and experience, AB demonstrated the same incremental learning rate on subsequent learning trials of the passages as did the controls. We conclude that, although severely impaired at the first learning trial (on both 'new' and 'old' passages), AB was able to employ his long-established semantic and procedural skills to attempt the task, and that thereafter he showed a 'normal' rate of incremental learning from a lower baseline.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.001,,Actor; Autobiographical amnesia; Episodic memory; Semantic learning,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

We report this phenomenon in a 33 yr-old, right-handed man (JG) in association with the extension in the right thalamus of a previously small, bilateral thalamic lesion. JG presented with a dense amnesia for autobiographical material more than a few years old, with some sparing of recent memories. Furthermore, he was completely unable to recognise famous people or world events. Many other aspects of semantic knowledge were intact and there was no evidence of general intellectual impairment, executive dysfunction or loss of visual imagery. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute lesion in the right thalamus and two small, symmetrical, bilateral non-acute thalamic lesions. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment indicated a stable pattern of impaired retrograde and spared anterograde memory over 18 months and psychiatric assessments yielded no evidence of confabulation, malingering or other symptoms to suggest psychogenic amnesia. JG's profile indicates that the division of declarative memory into just two categories - episodic and semantic - is inadequate. Rather, his case adds to the growing body evidence to suggest that world knowledge pertaining to people and events is stored or accessed similarly to autobiographical information and differently from other types of more general factual knowledge. We hypothesize that the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and immediately surrounding regions comprise the central processing mechanism referred to by McClelland (Revue Neurologique, 150 (1994) 570) and Markowitsch (Brain Research Review, 21 (1995) 117) as responsible for inducing and co-ordinating the recall of these sorts of cortically stored memory engrams.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00041-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

8708688,Memory without context: amnesia with confabulations after infarction of the right capsular genu.,"Schnider, A; Gutbrod, K; Hess, C W; Schroth, G",Schnider,"To explore the mechanism of an amnesia marked by confabulations and lack of insight in a patient with an infarct of the right inferior capsular genu. The confabulations could mostly be traced back to earlier events, indicating that the memory disorder ensued from an inability to store the temporal and spatial context of information acquisition rather than a failure to store new information. To test the patient's ability to store the context of information acquisition, two experiments were composed in which she was asked to decide when or where she had learned the words from two word lists presented at different points in time or in different rooms. To test her ability to store new information, two continuous recognition tests with novel non-words and nonsense designs were used. Recognition of these stimuli was assumed to be independent of the context of acquisition because the patient could not have an a priori sense of familiarity with them. The patient performed at chance in the experiments probing knowledge of the context of information acquisition, although she recognised the presented words almost as well as the controls. By contrast, her performance was normal in the recognition tests with non-words and nonsense designs. These findings indicate that the patient's amnesia was based on an inability to store the context of information acquisition rather than the information itself. Based on an analysis of her lesion, which disconnected the thalamus from the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, and considering the similarities between her disorder, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and the amnesia after orbitofrontal lesions, it is proposed that contextual amnesia results from interruption of the loop connecting the amygdala, the dorsomedial nucleus, and the orbitofrontal cortex.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.61.2.186,PMC1073994,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

MRI examination revealed an injury to both temporal poles and to the latero-ventral portion of the right prefrontal cortex.

The patient was of average intelligence. His attention, short-term memory, and learning ability were average or somewhat below average. His old memories were severely affected in the personal-episodic domain, and much less so in that of semantic remote memory.

16703957,Dissociative contributions of medial temporal and frontal regions to prospective remembering.,"Umeda, Satoshi; Nagumo, Yumi; Kato, Motoichiro",Umeda,"Prospective memory is memory of future intentions or plans in everyday life. Although some previous neuropsychological studies have stated that the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe are essential for successful prospective remembering, how the two regions contribute to prospective remembering remains unclear. We therefore used prospective memory training in the present study to investigate the neural mechanism of two components of prospective remembering: remembering to remember and remembering content. Two brain-damaged patients participated in this study: patient Y.O., who had lesions in the medial temporal lobe bilaterally, and patient T.K., who had a lesion in the basal forebrain and right medial frontal lobe. Both participants exhibited a severe anterograde amnesic syndrome and had normal IQ scores. Before the prospective memory training the participants underwent several index memory tests to examine their general memory and prospective memory performance. The training consisted of requesting the participants to perform an original mini-day task, in which they were first asked to memorize five simple daily actions with their times for execution, and then to recall the content of the actions when shown a drawing of a clock showing the proper time for execution. A training session was carried out once a week for 3 months. After completing training, the participants were again requested to take the same index memory tests. The results of the training task showed that Y.O.'s memory performance had gradually improved across all sessions of training, but T.K.'s improvement was not as marked. A more detailed analysis revealed that Y.O.'s memory performance was better for recalling time than for recalling content, whereas T.K.'s memory performance was better for recalling content than for recalling time. Furthermore, the results of the final index memory tests showed that the only improvement in Y.O.'s prospective memory was in remembering to remember, and that the only improvement in T.K.'s prospective memory was in remembering content. These results provide strong evidence that these two remembering components of prospective memory have independent neural bases, with the basal forebrain and right medial frontal lobe being required for remembering to remember, and the medial temporal lobe being required for remembering content. The results also suggest that memory training is an effective, means of improving everyday memory.",{},,Reviews in the neurosciences,10.1515/revneuro.2006.17.1-2.267,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

M.R. suddenly recovered from his mutism following a mild brain trauma 2 years later. M.R.'s neuropsychological pattern and anatomoclinical correlations were studied through (i) language and memory assessment to characterize his deficits, (ii) functional neuroimaging during a standard language paradigm, and (iii) assessment of frontal and left insular connectivity through diffusion tractography imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation. A control evaluation was repeated after recovery. M.R. recovered from the left hemiparesis within 90 days of the accident, which indicated a transient right brain impairment. One year later, neurobehavioral, language and memory evaluations strongly suggested a dissociative component in the mutism and retrograde amnesia. Investigations (including MRI, fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, EEG and r-TMS) were normal. Twenty-seven months after the electrical injury, M.R. had a very mild head injury which was followed by a rapid recovery of speech. However, the retrograde amnesia persisted.

For many years CW stated several times a day that he had just woken up. He frequently wrote this in his diary too. When shown examples of his diary entries or videos of himself playing or conducting music, he recognised both his handwriting and himself on the video screen but stated vehemently that he ""was not conscious then"". In a previous paper (Wilson, Baddeley, & Kapur 1995), it was suggested that this lack of awareness for the past was a delusion, defined as a strongly held belief in the face of contradictory evidence (rather than implying any kind of psychiatric disorder per se). As a contribution to the academic debate regarding theories of ""self"", in the present paper we will review this explanation of CW's state as it had been in those early years, and we will also consider two other possibilities - namely, that CW had suffered from a loss of ""autobiographical self"" or ""extended consciousness"" (see Damasio, 2000, pp. 198-199), and that his verbal reports simply reflected a form of coping strategy to help him deal with the limited evidence he had available in ""declarative"" memory.",{},,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602010802141889,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 50-year-old right-handed man developed severe amnesic syndrome and collecting behavior after total removal of a craniopharyngioma. He had very poor results on tests of learning, recall, and recognition for both verbal and nonverbal tasks.

The present case suggests that damage to the brain structures surrounding the third ventricle associated with surgery for craniopharyngioma may result in amnesic syndrome and collecting behavior. Generally, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach is the optimum choice for the removal of craniopharyngioma without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, but the risk of neuropsychologic disturbances must be kept in mind.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31804c6fb8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present an instructive imaging case of sudden onset of persistent amnesia due to selective ischemic damage of the anterior fornix. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old Japanese male came to our attention for a sudden onset of retrograde amnesia, associated with severe anterograde amnesia. The brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright diffusion restriction, which was associated with swollen fornices bilaterally. His symptoms gradually improved, but episodic memory impairment still persisted after 1 month. The coronal T1-weighted MPRAGE (magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo) sequence clearly showed disruption of the left anterior fornix. Diffusion tensor tracking showed decrease in the density of entire fiber tracts on the Papez circuit as well as location of the left fornix.

19540415,[Carbon monoxide intoxication and anterograde amnesia].,"Mahmoud, O; Mestour, M; Loualidi, M",Mahmoud,"Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is still one of the most frequent conditions causing brain damage as a result of hypoxia in Morocco, and the main area of brain damage is the hippocampus. The role of the hippocampus in the memory process has been known for long and we usually associate hippocampus damage with anterograde amnesia. Nevertheless, the pure amnesic syndrome is retrieved in the isolated damage of the hippocampus as is seen in the anoxia caused by CO intoxication. The outcome of the patterns depends on the extent of brain damage, the age of onset and the early diagnosis. This study presents the case of a young female patient who presented with anterograde amnesia after massive and prolonged accidental exposition to CO that presented disproportional radiological and clinical outcome. Primary care was in the intensive care unit during 24 hours and based on oxygen therapy and diuretics. The psychiatric examination found an acute stress disorder and symptoms of delirium in the form of reduced awareness and memory deficit. The amnesia was anterograde and the patient exhibited diminished ability to remember time, space and persons. The Galveston orientation and amnesia test (GOAT) score on awakening in the intensive care unit was 46. The laboratory findings did not provide direct physiological disturbances. The brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral hippocampus low-density in the cerebral white and grey matter. The clinical and the radiological outcome of this pattern were not correlated. The GOAT scores were 46 on the 10th day and 50 when the patient was discharged three weeks later, although the brain CT scan showed a decrease of the low-density in the hippocampus. Forty-five days later, the GOAT score was still 49 and the brain CT scan did not show any low-density lesion. Clinical symptoms of a major depressive episode were installed. These results are correlated to the findings of several series in which the CT scans in CO intoxication show common characteristic features that are symmetrical low-density lesions in the cerebral white matter in some specific brain structures such as the globus pallidus and the hippocampus. The early diagnosis is usually difficult because the brain CT scan findings do not always provide morphological changes and fail approximately one half of the time to detect low-density in the white matter of the hippocampus, and the use of MRI is not as easy as the CT scan. The long period of unconsciousness, the white matter damage and the late diagnosis result in complications in the outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,L'Encephale,10.1016/j.encep.2008.02.011,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
16532698,[A case of left dorsomedial thalamic infarction with unilateral schizophrenia-like auditory hallucinations].,"Yoshida, Yukihiro; Abe, Koji; Yoshizawa, Kikuko",Yoshida,"We report a case of a right-handed, 73-year-old woman with auditory hallucinations lateralized to the right ear. A brain MRI revealed a small infarction in the left dorsomedial nucleus (DM) of the thalamus. The patient did not have either psychiatric or neurological prior history, and had otherwise been treated for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. Two months prior to admission, she had become forgetful, and had lost her wallet several times. She concurrently began to experience auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of her acquaintances, or ""the gods"". She frequently monologized and wandered about outside following the contents of the hallucinations. Therefore, she was admitted to our institution. On admission, no apparent abnormalities were revealed by physical examinations or blood analyses. She was alert and had no aphasic symptoms. Except for memory disturbances, no neurological symptoms, including no hearing loss, were found. A brain MRI showed a small localized infarction in the left DM, but EEG findings were normal. The patient had prominent anterograde memory deficits: she hardly remembered what she had done the very same day, or the names of the doctor and hospital. She also demonstrated a retrograde amnesia of the past decade or two: she showed difficulty recalling either personal history or social events that occurred during this era. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) revealed a total IQ of 75 (verbal IQ 77; performance IQ 77). The verbal hallucinations continued with frequent occurrence even after admission. They included voices telling her about misfortunes, such as death or sickness, of her relatives. These turned into threats and commands, such as ""I'm gonna kill ya. I attack you from behind. You, do not eat!"" In addition, she occasionally experienced ""third person auditory hallucination"", in which several men were discussing the plan to kill her. As is characteristic of this type of case, the hallucinations always appeared in only her right ear. They did not occur in the other modalities (e.g. as a visual one). She was convinced that the hallucinations were real and looked frightened while they were happening. Whereas the anterograde amnesia continued for 6 months after admission, the retrograde amnesia gradually improved within 2 or 3 months after admission, although a partial amnesia on the past decade eventually turned out to persistent. On the other hand, the hallucinations did not ameliorate satisfactorily with risperidone (3-6 mg/day), but on augmentation with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day), they lessened gradually and almost disappeared within 6 months. She also slowly developed symptoms similar to those of frontal lobe syndrome, i.e., aspontaneity and apathy. In conclusion, our case indicates the importance of DM on memory function. It is noteworthy that schizophrenia-like hallucinations developed in the case. Localized neuronal deficits evoked by infarction in the left DM probably caused the schizophrenia-like hallucinations; the lateralization phenomenon further indicates the involvement of specific neuronal mechanisms in the mediation of the hallucinations. According to the knowledge of the functional anatomy of the DM and the lateralization phenomenon of auditory hallucinations, it is possible that the neuronal loop, comprised of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, designated as ""basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits"", in addition to the left temporal cortex, plays an important role in the development of the hallucinations in this case. This possibility might also shed light on the neurological basis of schizophrenia.",{},,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Studies with M.L. demonstrated a dissociation between episodic and semantic memory. His retrograde amnesia was specific to episodic autobiographical memory. Convergent behavioral and functional imaging data suggested that his anterograde memory, while appearing normal, was accomplished with reduced autonoetic awareness (awareness of the self as a continuous entity across time that is a crucial element of episodic memory). While previous research on M.L. focused on anterograde memory of laboratory stimuli, in this study, M.L.'s autobiographical memory for post-injury events or anterograde autobiographical memory was examined using prospective collection of autobiographical events via audio diary with detailed behavioral and functional neuroanatomical analysis. Consistent with his reports of subjective disconnection from post-injury autobiographical events, M.L. assigned fewer ""remember"" ratings to his autobiographical events than comparison subjects. His generation of event-specific details using the Autobiographical Interview [Levine, B., Svoboda, E., Hay, J., Winocur, G., & Moscovitch, M. (2002).

While listening to the autobiographical audio diary segments, M.L. showed reduced activation relative to comparison subjects in midline frontal and posterior nodes previously identified as part of the autobiographical memory network. Reductions were also evident in M.L. in association with personal semantic stimuli (e.g., recordings describing personal habits and routines). These data suggest an association between M.L.'s impoverished recollection of autobiographical material and reduced activation in midline sectors of the autobiographical memory network that support the autonoetic, first-person element of episodic memory.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.12.026,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Single-photon emission CT revealed a severe relative hypoperfusion of both thalami, a relative hypoperfusion of both nuclei caudati, and a relative hypoperfusion mesiofrontally. Single-photon emission CT data support the hypothesis that the neurobehavioral manifestations after bithalamic paramedian infarction are caused by disruption of the striatal-ventral pallidal-thalamic-frontomesial limbic loop.

Strikingly, whilst SL could not provide any specific details of events from the past two weeks or past two years and had impaired recall of events from her late 30s, her descriptions of potential future events were normal in number of event details and plausibility. This dissociation of past and future events' performance after mammillary body and fornix damage is at odds with the findings of the majority of patients with adult onset hippocampal amnesia. It suggests that these non-hippocampal regions of the Papez circuit are only critical for past event retrieval and not for the generation of possible future events.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1080/13854046.2016.1142612,,Thalamus; Wernicke–Korsakoff’s; cognition; diencephalic lesion; memory,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Neurologically she was normal except for mild right hemianopsia and increased deep tendon reflexes in the extremities. Neuropsychological assessments were performed over 3 weeks. She was always alert, attentive, and cooperative. She had no confabulation. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised (WAIS-R), her total IQ was 110. Frontal, verbal, and perceptual functions and motor performance were normal. She had no signs of a callosal disconnection. Despite these preserved functions, her memory function was obviously disturbed. Several memory betteries showed that her recent memory for both verbal and visual modalities was impaired, while her immediate memory such as digit span was preserved. For remote memory her retrograde episodic memory concerning both personal and public events was almost intact, although she had a profound anterograde amnesia. In particular she recalled her personal information about just-premorbid events in detail.

It is argued that frequently a too straightforward and unidimensional interpretation of the relations between brain damage and a behavioral deficit is formulated in such reports. Evidence obtained by modern anatomical techniques as well as the widespread and time-dependent effects of lesions make it necessary to consider a lesion of a particular structure of the brain and correlated mnemonic disturbances as possibly due to an altered equilibrium in an extensive network of the brain. The primary lesion of one or the other specific structure may lead to severe and lasting amnesia or may fail to do so depending on its influence on other brain regions.,{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(84)80021-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

This behavioral syndrome has not yet been reported with isolated diencephalic lesions, but it has been observed after bilateral temporal lobe lesions.

We established that RFR had a persistent severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia for personal and public events. His personal semantic knowledge was relatively spared for the retrograde period. There was a modest and global reduction in RFR's vocabulary for words acquired in adulthood before he became amnesic but there was no evidence of any retrograde gradient. His retrograde knowledge of people was also without any gradient. Remarkably, there had been no change in the extent of his semantic knowledge across a prolonged re-test interval indicating that the loss of semantic knowledge was stable and likely to have arisen at the time of his initial lesion. RFR also showed evidence of a limited but significant ability to acquire new word meanings and a more restricted capacity for learning about new celebrities. While he was able to demonstrate face and name familiarity for newly famous people, he was unable to provide much semantic detail.

We assessed (i) a group pattern of relative hypometabolism; and (ii) the consistency of this group pattern, if any, in individual subjects, according to etiology. The results from the group analysis documented that permanent amnesia is associated with hypometabolism in the thalamus, posterior cingulate cortex, and mesial prefrontal cortex (near the anterior cingulate gyrus), bilaterally, as well as in the left supramarginal and middle temporal gyri. The individual analysis showed that this group pattern was found in essentially each patient, regardless of the cause of amnesia. Thus, permanent amnesia is subtended by dysfunction in structures belonging to Papez/limbic circuits as well as in left-hemisphere areas typically concerned with verbal functions, probably through a mechanism of thalamo-cortical disconnection and possibly involved in retrograde amnesia. The use of a voxel-based method allowed us to map a common network of synaptic dysfunction in a neuropsychological syndrome regardless of etiology.

Online representations of a current event are thought to be supported by a network of regions centred on the posterior midline cortex (PMC). By contrast, episodic memory is widely believed to be supported by interactions between the hippocampus and these cortical regions. In this MRI study, we investigated the encoding and retrieval of real life-like events (video clips) in a patient with severe amnesia likely resulting from a stroke to the right (and possibly the left) thalamus, and a group of 20 age-matched controls. Structural MRI revealed grey matter reductions in left hippocampus and left thalamus in comparison to controls. We first characterised the regions activated in the controls while they watched and retrieved the videos. There were no differences in activation between the patient and controls in any of the regions. We then identified a widespread network of brain regions, including the hippocampus, that were functionally connected with the PMC in controls. However, in the patient there was a specific reduction in functional connectivity between the PMC and a region of left hippocampus when both watching and attempting to retrieve the videos. A follow up analysis of the control group revealed that, when watching the videos, the functional connectivity between these two regions was correlated with memory performance. Taken together, these findings support the view that the interactions between the PMC and the hippocampus enable the encoding and retrieval of naturalistic events.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.05.022,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Neuropsychological and postmortem neuropathological findings are described here for three additional amnesic patients with bilateral damage limited to the hippocampal formation. Findings from these patients, taken together with the findings from patient RB and other amnesic patients, make three important points about memory.

(2) Bilateral damage beyond, the CA1 region, but still limited to the hippocampal formation, can produce more severe anterograde memory impairment.

We report a 46-year-old man with acute aseptic limbic encephalitis in association with RBD. The patient presented with subacute onset of anterograde/retrograde amnesia and persistent fever. Abnormal nocturnal behavior during sleep consisted of waving hands to fight and kicking legs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed damage on the bilateral unci and medial temporal lobes. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated aseptic encephalitis. A polysomnography revealed augmented phasic activity in the submental and bilateral tibialis anterior muscles during REM sleep. Our finding suggests that limbic system impairment may lead to the occurrence of RBD.,"DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-009-5067-9,,,Case Reports; Letter,Germany,eng

As long as her declarative memory, complex perceptual abilities and global cognitive status were spared, we surmised that any deficit in executive learning would have occurred in relative isolation. We showed that her abnormal performance on the WCST, both on the standard as well as on the post-instruction condition, was due to an impairment of shifting attention across perceptual dimensions (extra-dimensional). In contrast, her ability to shift attention within perceptual categories (intra-dimensional) was spared, as were her declarative memory, object and visuospatial perception, oral language comprehension and praxis (ideomotor, tool use and constructional). This case supports the hypothesis that executive amnesia is a type of amnesic disorder distinct from the classic amnesic syndrome due to mamillo-temporomedial damage. As such, it is probably closely related to procedural learning and may depend on the same fronto-subcortical loops that mediate the actual execution of behaviour.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.7.5.383.16244,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

16210232,A role for the thalamus in memory for unique entities.,"Miller, Laurie A; Caine, Diana; Watson, John D G",Miller,"Recent case studies of amnesic patients have yielded patterns of impairment that challenge Tulving's (1972) division of retrograde memory into two categories (namely, episodic and semantic memory). Here we describe a patient (JG) who developed partially blocked access to previously stored knowledge following the onset of a medial thalamic infarction. Having previously demonstrated that JG has a dense, pervasive amnesia for autobiographical material, famous people and famous events (Miller et al. , 2001), in this study, we show that he is unable to access information about unique entities across a range of domains. In contrast, his memory for more general semantic knowledge (such as word meanings) is intact. JG's memory impairment is discussed in the context of a model of neural functioning put forward by Damasio (1990), in which it was proposed that recall of unique entities depends on many cortical regions being activated in synchrony. This activity, thought to be triggered and coordinated by anterior temporal and frontal lobe regions is, in turn, modulated by projections from the thalamus. We propose that JG's thalamic lesion has disrupted the coordination of the diffuse cortical networks necessary to generate highly specific memories from the past, be they episodic or semantic.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.6.504.29375,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article,England,eng

The acute phase of rehabilitation poses difficulties for amnestic individuals that may elicit classic PTA symptoms as well as premorbid PTSS, thereby activating maladaptive cognitions and an increase in agitation and arousal. Historically, explicit learning and memory strategies were considered non-efficacious with amnestic individuals until PTA resolves; therefore, rehabilitation therapies have utilized implicit learning in the initial phases of recovery. However, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which uses explicit learning and memory strategies based on cognitive, trauma, and neuropsychology lowers agitation and confusion for amnestic individuals with PTSS. In this paper, two case studies present preliminary evidence for effective implicit learning following a CBT intervention for individuals in PTA after a severe TBI receiving care. Notably, following a CBT intervention, agitation, confusion, and arousal were diminished despite having no recollection of the intervention. Thus, these cases suggest amnestic individuals in the acute recovery stage after severe TBI benefit from CBT to replace maladaptive attributions minimizing PTA and PTSS (e.g., confusion, arousal, and agitation) and improving motivation, participation, and recovery.",{},,Military medicine,10.1093/milmed/usy179,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Testing for remote episodic memory of autobiographical events, and for remote semantic memory of personal and public events, and of famous people, revealed that AD had a severe retrograde amnesia for autobiographical episodes that covered his entire lifetime, and a time-limited retrograde amnesia for semantic memory. Because the fornix and basal forebrain lesions disrupted major afferent and efferent pathways of the hippocampus, it was concluded that the integrity of the hippocampus and its projections are needed to retain and/or recover autobiographical memories no matter how old they are. By contrast, hippocampal contribution to semantic memory is time-limited.

Magnetic resonance showed high signal intensity and marked volume loss in the hippocampus bilaterally; the left and right parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipito-temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, and lateral temporal cortex were normal. This case underlines that global amnesia associated with hippocampal damage does not affect semantic memory. Although the hippocampus is important in retrieving context-linked information, its role is not so crucial in retrieving semantic contents. Cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus and lateral temporal areas might guide the recall of semantic information.",{},,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1076/clin.15.4.508.1889,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
11595089,Transient crossed aphasia and persistent amnesia after right thalamic haemorrhage.,"Maeshima, S; Ozaki, F; Okita, R; Yamaga, H; Okada, H; Kakishita, K; Moriwaki, H; Roger, P",Maeshima,"A 45-year-old right-handed woman suffered transient aphasia and persistent amnesia after a right thalamic haemorrhage. This patient appeared to have crossed aphasia, although it disappeared within 8 weeks. It is noteworthy that the patient had a unilateral right thalamic lesion but exhibited both verbal and non-verbal memory impairment. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral haemorrhage in the right thalamus involving the ventral anterior nucleus, medioventral nucleus, mamillothalamic tract, internal medullary lamina, and mediodorsal nucleus. An amytal test was performed and suggested that the right hemisphere was dominant for language functions and the left hemisphere was dominant for visuospatial functions. Single photon emission CT revealed a low perfusion area only in the right thalamus. These findings suggest that the right hemisphere might be dominant for both verbal and non-verbal memory function in this patient, although visuospatial function was lateralized in the left hemisphere.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050110065646,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
8353716,Autobiographical amnesia resulting from bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction. A case study in cognitive neurobiology.,"Hodges, J R; McCarthy, R A",Hodges,"A patient with a chronic amnesic state resulting from bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction showed a pattern of retrograde amnesia not previously reported. Personally relevant autobiographical memory was profoundly impaired, whereas knowledge of famous people and public events was relatively spared. Furthermore, knowledge of famous people, including the ability to make accurate temporal judgements, was less affected than knowledge of public events. In addition, we have documented a severe and systematic distortion of personal memory. These findings are not compatible with current accounts of retrograde amnesia based either upon the type of information stored (e.g. episodic versus semantic memory), or upon simple storage versus access models. We propose an explanation based upon an interactive cognitive model in which the patient shows a disorder at the 'thematic retrieval framework' level of memory organization due to a disconnection of frontal and medial temporal memory systems.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/116.4.921,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
826234,[Neuroanatomical correlates of the amnestic syndrome (author's transl)].,"Mehraein, P; Rothemund, E",Mehraein,"An amnestic syndrome can be observed in several organic brain disorders. This paper tries to elucidate the anatomical substrate of this syndrome by investigation of the brain in 168 carefully examined cases. These included 55 cases of brain tumor, 8 of encephalitis, 55 of Wernicke encephalopathy, and 50 of Alzheimers disease or senile dementia. All these patients had shown a prominent amnestic syndrome. Despite the diversity of the organic brain pathology the anatomical findings in all cases were bilateral lesions of variable intensity in one or more of the following structures: Ammon's horn, fornix, and corpus mammillare. In conformity with the literature it is a assumed that preservation of these structures must be of great significance for the processes of mnemonic registration, integration, and recall. A bilateral lesion in all or some of these centers and their connections causes, as a rule, disturbances of memory. This conclusion, however, does not rule out the possibility that similar memory disturbances may occur following other organic lesions, localized elsewhere in the brain.",{},,Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten,10.1007/BF02206615,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger
6470166,An individualized memory retraining program after closed-head injury: a single-case study.,"Crosson, B; Buenning, W",Crosson,"A memory-retraining program was designed for a patient approximately 2 1/2 months after he suffered a closed-head injury. Tests showed his memory deficit to be relatively isolated in the verbal sphere. An attempt was made to design a program in which tasks resembled the environmental demands on the patient for retention of verbal material. On a routine basis, the patient was read various paragraphs and was subsequently required to write them from memory. Three different strategies were used in an attempt to improve memory. After 15 days of training, the patient improved from an impaired level of verbal recall to a normal level. Strategies employing (a) visual imagery and other mnemonic devices and (b) questioning during presentation appeared to be most effective in facilitating retention. There was some drop in memory performance at a 9 month follow-up, and the patient was encouraged to resume active use of mnemonic strategies. Implications for further study are discussed.",{},,Journal of clinical neuropsychology,10.1080/01688638408401219,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
20029695,Mental time in amnesia: evidence from bilateral medial temporal damage before and after recovery.,"Arzy, Shahar; Bick, Atira; Blanke, Olaf",Arzy,"The human mind is continuously involved in ""projecting"" the self in time in order to process past memories and predict future occurrences. ""Self-projection"" in time involves episodic and spatial memory, relying on medial-temporal structures, but also engages visuo-spatial imagery, relying on occipito-temporal structures, and self-location, relying on temporo-parietal structures. Here we had the rare opportunity to investigate the relation between self-projection in time and memory, using a novel behavioural paradigm, in a patient with subacute bilateral medial-temporal damage during a period of amnesia as well as after recovery. Despite her memory deficit the patient was able to ""project"" herself to past and future, yet with significant improvement after recovery. We discuss our findings with respect to the relations between episodic memory and medial-temporal structures with self-projection in time to past and future.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290903439178,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
