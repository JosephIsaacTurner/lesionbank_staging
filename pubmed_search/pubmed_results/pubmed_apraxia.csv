36498400,Swallowing Apraxia Post Ischemic Stroke.,"Alfaris, Abdullah Mohammed; Alghamdi, Atheer Saeed; Almowalad, Enas Saad; Al Harbi, Awad Aweid; Alghamdi, Khaled Abdulraheem; Saeedi, Jameelah; Al Awaji, Nisreen Naser",Alfaris,"A 55-year-old male patient with a known medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and treated lymphoma was first admitted with a sudden left-sided facial asymmetry and mouth deviation to the left side with no other neurological symptoms. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed acute infarct and small left basal ganglia old lacunar infarction. He was discharged on a dual antiplatelet. One week later, the patient's condition had worsened and, therefore, was admitted with an impression of ischemic stroke. A bedside swallowing assessment, VFSS, and FEES study were conducted to diagnose this case. The bedside assessment did not reveal any sensory or motor deficits in his oral cavity and the FEES examination was also unable to rule out pharyngeal dysphagia. However, a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) revealed a significant dysfunction of oral preparation and oral phases and presented difficulty initiating the pharyngeal phase. Given these features, we believe that this swallowing difficulty is caused by swallowing apraxia. This case provides additional information and understanding on management from the swallowing side.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,10.3390/ijerph192316329,PMC9737384,FEES; VFSS; ischemic stroke; swallowing apraxia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
6850274,Callosal apraxia.,"Watson, R T; Heilman, K M",Watson,"A 43-year-old woman suffered a spontaneous corpus callosum disconnection, resulting in apraxia and apraxic agraphia confined to the left hand. She initially had a functionally total callosal disconnection. With time, the splenium of the corpus callosum became functional, and a computerized tomographic scan performed five months after the onset showed infarction of only the body of the corpus callosum. Concomitant with this improvement in callosal function, the apraxia changed from ideational (loss of the concept of skilled movements) to classic ideomotor apraxia. A temporal analysis of this case provided support for Liepmann's (Liepmann, 1900; Liepmann and Maas, 1970) hypothesis that there is a centre for visuokinaesthetic (space-time) engrams in the left hemisphere of right-handed patients that controls skilled motor acts in either hand.

3796825,Callosal apraxia.,"Graff-Radford, N R; Welsh, K; Godersky, J",Graff-Radford,"A 39-year-old right-handed woman suffered a ruptured pericallosal aneurysm. Serial MRI studies showed damage to the genu and most of the body of the corpus callosum but not the splenium. Both supplementary motor areas (SMA) appeared intact. We studied the patient's praxis performance at intervals over a 4-month period with a standardized battery. The study suggests that apraxia seen in patients with callosal lesions is probably due to the callosal damage, not to the usually associated SMA lesion. Our findings support Liepmann's idea that the left hemisphere is dominant for praxis in both hands. We propose, however, that the dominance effect is related to the type of test given and varies among individuals. As regards the latter, in some individuals the left hemisphere is strongly dominant for motor tasks, while in others it is less so. As regards the type of test, the most enduring left-hand apraxia is seen in verbal, not visuomotor tests.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.37.1.100,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
22075046,Callosal warning syndrome.,"Nandhagopal, Ramachandiran; Al-Asmi, Abdullah; Johnston, William James; Jacob, P C; Arunodaya, G R",Nandhagopal,"To report the clinical and imaging findings in a patient with an initial fluctuating disconnection syndrome due to corpus callosal ischemia that ultimately culminated in infarction with persistent symptoms. A 40-year-old, hypertensive, right-handed man presented with transient, stereotyped symptoms of corpus callosal disconnection (intermanual conflict, apraxia, dysgraphia and construction difficulties in his left hand). Serial magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated the ischemic nature of the initial fluctuating symptoms and later showed callosal infarction when the symptoms were persistent. Magnetic resonance angiogram did not reveal significant stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid or proximal portion of anterior cerebral arteries. Patient received standard treatment for ischemic stroke and at follow-up 1 month later, had mild left hand apraxia, dysgraphia and construction difficulties. The case highlights the unusual occurrence of crescendo transient ischemic attacks culminating in infarction in the location of corpus callosum. We have termed this novel stroke syndrome as 'callosal warning syndrome' as the temporal profile was quite indistinguishable from that of relatively well-known stroke warning syndromes in the location of internal capsule and pontine tegmentum.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2011.10.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

A 60-yr-old, right-handed male patient underwent removal of brain meningioma and drainage of intraventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage in the left fronto-parietal lobe. At the time of DTT scanning (5 wk after onset), he was able to move the right upper extremity against gravity. The patient exhibited an intact ideational plan for motor performance. In addition, he was able to use actual objects (scissors, eraser) using his right wrist and hand. However, he had difficulty in using his right upper extremity for pantomime of object use, imitating gestures (meaningless or meaningful), and movement of his right upper extremity proximal. Score on the ideomotor apraxia test for the right side was 4 (cut-off score < 32). DTTs for the left superior longitudinal fasciculus to the left premotor cortex and left inferior parietal lobule showed partial injury, compared with the right superior longitudinal fasciculus.

38344353,Apraxia of speech due to the left postcentral gyrus lesion.,"Mitani, Naoko; Sakurai, Yasuhisa",Mitani,"Apraxia of speech (AOS) due to a postcentral infarction differs from conventional precentral AOS with respect to phonemic errors (phoneme substitution) which are more common than phonetic errors (phoneme distortion) and preserved accent and intonation. Clinical features of apraxia of speech caused by lesions in the postcentral gyrus have not yet been elucidated. Here, we report a patient with this lesion and show how postcentral apraxia of speech differs from the hitherto known precentral apraxia of speech. A 54-year-old man developed Broca's aphasia with apraxia of speech that resolved into pure apraxia of speech within 3 weeks following infarction of the postcentral gyrus. The diagnosis of apraxia of speech was based on the patient's effortful, slow speech and inconsistent phonetic distortions with phonemic paraphasia. The Western Aphasia Battery was used to examine the patient's speech samples. Speech was recorded using a digital voice recorder and transcribed into a narrow transcription of the International Phonetic Alphabet. The error types were categorized phonologically. The results revealed that (a) phonemic errors (vowel and consonant substitutions, also known as phonemic paraphasia) were more common than phonetic errors (vowel and consonant distortions). Similar to conduction aphasia, phonemic errors were more pronounced in confrontation naming than in repetition, accompanied by self-correction, and (b) word accent and sentence intonation were preserved, although the speech was slow. These two features are characteristic of postcentral apraxia of speech, which can be differentiated from conventional precentral apraxia of speech.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Clinical case reports,10.1002/ccr3.8499,PMC10857924,conduction aphasia; dysprosody; phonemic paraphasia; phonetic distortion,Case Reports,England,eng
35028199,Pure Infarct of the Oculomotor Nucleus With Fetal Posterior Cerebral Artery Involvement.,"Ahmad, Myra; Ahmad, Salman; Ahmad, Hamzah; Basile, Eric; Roche, Patricia",Ahmad,"Vascular anomalies are present in the posterior circulation. In the case of this stroke patient, the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was shown to have a fetal origin. A fetal PCA is classified as either a partial or complete fetal PCA, which can be determined by the presence of a remnant or absence of P1, the PCA segment directly arising from the terminal of the basilar artery. If absent, the PCA has arisen completely from the internal carotid artery (ICA) and is termed complete fetal PCA, or cfPCA. A partial fetal PCA, or pfPCA, is what is found when a hypoplastic segment persists.

These symptoms, in combination, are rare and can be quite debilitating as they impact visuospatial skills, visual scanning and attentional mechanisms. The literature addressing rehabilitation of individuals with Balint's syndrome is sparse. The current case report describes the outcome of a 58-year old male who presented with Balint's syndrome secondary to severe traumatic brain injury and following completion of a comprehensive post-acute brain injury rehabilitation programme. The patient was 4-months post-injury onset upon admission and received 6 months of rehabilitation services as an inpatient. The patient's comprehensive rehabilitation programme involved a 3-pronged approach including the implementation of (a) compensatory strategies, (b) remediation exercises and (c) transfer of learned skills in multiple environments and situations with implementation of psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Comprehensive neuropsychological and occupational therapy evaluations were performed at admission and at discharge in order to monitor cognitive, affective, neurological and functional change over time.

33823819,An autopsy-proven case of Corticobasal degeneration heralded by Pontine infarction.,"Yoo, Dallah; Park, Sung-Hye; Yu, Sungwook; Ahn, Tae-Beom",Yoo,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by insidious progression with poorly-delineated long latent period. Antecedent clinical insult could rarely unmask latent neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an autopsy-proven case of corticobasal degeneration which was preceded by a lacunar infarction. A 58-year-old man presented with acute ataxia associated with a lacunar infarction in the right paramedian pons. His ataxia persisted with additional progressive gait difficulty and left arm clumsiness. Six months later, a follow-up neurological examination showed asymmetrical bradykinesia, apraxia, dystonic posturing, postural instability, and mild ataxia of the left limbs. Cognitive examination revealed frontal executive dysfunction and visuospatial difficulties. Dopamine transporter imaging scan demonstrated bilateral reduced uptakes in mid-to-posterior putamen, more prominent on the right side. Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, asymmetric limb dystonia, and ideomotor apraxia became more conspicuous, while limb ataxia gradually vanished. The patient became unable to walk without assistance after 1 year, and died 4 years after the symptom onset. Autopsy findings showed frontoparietal cortical atrophy, ballooned neurons, and phosphorylated tau-positive astrocytic plaques and neuropil threads with gliosis and neuronal loss, confirming the corticobasal degeneration. The case illustrates that precedent clinical events such as stroke might tip a patient with subclinical CBS into overt clinical manifestations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02178-9,PMC8022434,Autopsy; Case report; Corticobasal degeneration; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The cerebellum facilitates movement coordination and provides a sense of equilibrium; damage to this structure can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including ataxia or dystaxia, ocular motor dysfunction, and disequilibrium. TBIs localised to the cerebellum are rare in dogs, and the prognosis following this type of injury remains unclear. A 10-year-old female Chihuahua/Dachshund-cross dog weighing 2.8 kg presented after a fall of approximately 1 m the preceding night. The dog exhibited paresis of all limbs and was recumbent with constant extensor rigidity with opisthotonos. The bilateral thoracic limb and right pelvic limb spinal reflexes were exaggerated, while the left pelvic limb spinal reflexes were normal. The menace response was decreased, and vertical nystagmus was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense lesion on T2weighted (W) images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Mannitol and prednisolone were administered, and the dog recovered. The bilateral pelvic limb postural reactions improved by Day 16. On Day 22, MRI revealed a decrease in the hyperintense area of the T2W images, and this lesion appeared isointense on DWI. In this case report, a dog with localised injury to the cerebellum that comprised a post-tentorial lesion recovered with a favourable outcome. Moreover, similar to reports in humans, DWI can help diagnose and evaluate TBI in dogs.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-022-03220-9,PMC8969374,Canine; Cerebellum; DWI; MRI; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

He thus has ""crossed"" somatoparaphrenia; (2) his delusional misidentification concerned the right leg and not the arm or hand; (3) he has no anosognosia; (4) his proprioception is disturbed for the leg only; and (5) the lesion site is very posterior, a left occipito-parietal haemorrhage without involvement of the frontal lobe or the posterior insula.

Our patient was severely impaired in pantomiming transitive gestures with the left hand and in reproducing novel non-symbolic hand and arm movement sequences. However, overlearned habitual actions like actual object use and intransitive gestures were relatively spared. Performance of axial commands was intact. Gesture recognition and discrimination were also preserved. Based on these findings, we propose that the praxis system of the right hemisphere is strongly biased toward ""concrete"" or context-dependent execution of familiar, well-established action routines. The right hemisphere is critically dependent on transcallosal contribution from the left hemisphere for control of the left hand in ""abstract"" or context-independent performance of transitive movements and in learning novel movement sequences. At least in some individuals, the right hemisphere can recognize and discriminate gestures.

Aphemia has been primarily reported in dominant frontal lobe strokes resulting in apraxia of speech (AoS), and in Foix-Chavany-Marie (FCM) syndrome where bilateral opercular or sub-opercular lesions result in anarthria due to deafferentation of brainstem nuclei supplying the oro-facio-lingual and pharyngeal musculature. Aphemia is not reported in non-dominant sub-insular strokes. Here, we present a case of aphemia following non-dominant sub-insular stroke in a patient who had previously recovered from a homologous dominant sub-insular stroke without any apparent residual deficits. We discuss the accepted definitions, theories and controversies in the use of the terminology - aphemia, apraxia of speech (AoS), anarthria related to FCM syndrome, a concomitant pathology - unilateral upper motor neuron (UUMN) dysarthria, and their neuro-anatomical bases. We also highlight the importance of attributing localization value to sequential homologous lesions of the brain that can unveil symptoms due to a ""loss of compensation phenomenon"" that we propose be termed as ""FCM phenomenon."" These pathological mechanisms may alone or in certain combinations contribute to the clinical syndrome of aphemia included in the diagnostic approach proposed here.

In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia is the disproportionate difficulty comprehending spoken compared to written language, also typically greater than difficulties with spoken and written language expression, in the absence of a primary sensory deficit. The terms pure word deafness and auditory verbal agnosia are often used synonymously. However, the broader term of auditory agnosia more accurately reflects difficulty processing both speech and non-speech sounds whereas individuals with auditory verbal agnosia (pure word deafness) have preserved processing of environmental sounds. Auditory agnosia is reported in the stroke literature, but rarely reported in progressive neurologic disorders. Here, we report a case of a woman who presented with what is best described as a prominent auditory deficit in the context of an initially unclassifiable, or mixed, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with accompanying apraxia of speech. Her clinical presentation shared features with auditory agnosia, although sensory functioning was not formally assessed.

On immunoblots of sarkosyl-insoluble brain extracts, a major doublet of 64 and 68 kDa full-length tau with two closely related fragments of approximately 37 kDa were detected. Based on these results, the patient was pathologically diagnosed as having CBD, excluding the possibility of tumor. Taken together with previous similar case reports, our findings indicate that a deep white matter hyperintense lesion on FLAIR images may be a useful clue to CBD, predicting rapid clinical progression with severe dementia based on severe white matter degeneration with a large amount of tau accumulation on pathological examination.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12638,,dementia; frontotemporal dementia; neuropil threads; tau proteins; white matter,Case Reports,Australia,eng
34567396,Recognizing Aphemia and How to Differentiate From Aphasia in the Era of Telemedicine.,"Kasturiarachi, Brittany M; Krishnaiah, Balaji",Kasturiarachi,"Aphemia, or pure motor mutism, is a phenomenon that has been reported previously in the literature and typically is associated with small infarcts in the inferior dominant precentral gyrus, pars opercularis, or inferior perirolandic gyrus. Clinically, it is important to distinguish aphemia from aphasia syndromes. Telemedicine is becoming more prevalent and involving neurologists across the country. This is an important consideration when addressing aphemic patients as many mistakes can be made during a virtual exam clouding a patient's clinical picture. Our patient is a 61-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and an old right frontoparietal stroke without any residual deficits. She presented after her family stated that she ""quit speaking"" for about seven hours. Initial neurological evaluation was done via telemedicine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was pertinent for decreased consciousness, inability to answer either orientation question, a right facial droop, and aphasia. Later it was found that the patient exhibited a pure motor mutism rather than aphasia and had an MRI lesion in the left inferior precentral gyrus. Differentiating aphemia from aphasia is an important clinical skill for a neurologist to foster especially in the era of telemedicine. An intimate knowledge of the parts of a speech exam are vital in directing emergency staff during stroke evaluation. Additionally, distinguishing these clinical syndromes has implications with respect to prognosis and long-term rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The Neurohospitalist,10.1177/1941874421990546,PMC8442164,aphasia; apraxia; clinical neurology examination; infarction; telemedicine,Case Reports,United States,eng

Neoplasia, inflammatory, demyelinating, and stroke are possible etiologies of this disorder. We report an elderly female who presented with dysarthria. She was dysarthric with a hypernasal voice, no apraxia or aphasia was observed. Tongue movements were slow with limited amplitude. Her soft palate dropped bilaterally; gag reflex was present. Also, she reported swallowing difficulty and choking with her saliva. Bilateral vertical and horizontal gaze were intact to either voluntary or oculocephalic movements. A cranial CT scan was suggestive of artery of Percheron (AOP) infarction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hypersignal on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted images and hyposignal on apparent diffusion coefficient in both thalami. CT angiography scan revealed an AOP originating from the left posterior cerebral artery. The swallowing study with a videofluoroscopic demonstrated oral and pharyngeal phases with severe dysfunction. To the authors' knowledge, there are two cases of individuals with artery of Percheron infarction who developed PBP associated with other clinical syndromes. Still, isolated PBP following infarction of Percheron's artery was not reported.

It is involved in self-initiated motor movements, planning and sequencing the motor action, response inhibition, and bimanual movements. Blood supply for supplementary motor area is mostly by callosomarginal branch of anterior cerebral artery. Stroke in anterior cerebral artery territory is relatively uncommon, moreover, isolated supplementary motor area stroke is a rare entity. Supplementary motor area stroke, as a syndrome, has variable symptoms consisting of impairment of volitional movements, hemineglect, dyspraxia of contralateral limbs, impaired muscle tone, mutism and contralateral weakness. As symptoms are sometimes ambivalent, patients may be misdiagnosed as functional disorder and lose the chance for immediate adequate treatments such as thrombolysis. We report a 59-year-old man with previous history for myocardial infarction, referred to emergency room with an acute dense right-side hemiplegia, positive Hoover sign, asymmetrical Babinski responses and intermittent ability to move his arm in some specific reflex actions despite plegia. Since brain computed tomography scan was unremarkable we could not be sure whether his symptoms were organic or functional until a diffusion weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging elucidated the situation.

Most patients have a monophasic course, often with hyponatremia. Herein, we report a 67-year-old Japanese male presenting with involuntary neck movement, abnormal behavior and apraxia. He was disoriented to time and place and occasionally unable to follow directions. Laboratory tests revealed the patient had hyponatremia (131 mEq/L). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed that the cell count (1/μL) and protein content (33 mg/dL) were in the normal ranges. Electroencephalography showed transient theta bursts in the right frontal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobe and basal forebrain on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) without gadolinium enhancement. Anti-voltage-gated potassium channel (Anti-VGKC) complex antibodies were below the reference level for limbic encephalitis. Although the diagnosis was unknown, intravenous methylprednisolone therapy was effective. Three years later, the patient began to speak incoherently and became disoriented to time. FLAIR MRI of the brain revealed recurrence in the left medial temporal lobe. The patient's serum sodium level was 131 mEq/L. After intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, he regained alertness. A CSF sample stored at the time of the first attack was assayed and the patient was found to be LGI1-positive and CASPR-2-negative, and the diagnosis of anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made.

8673498,"Diagonistic dyspraxia. Clinical characteristics, responsible lesion and possible underlying mechanism.","Tanaka, Y; Yoshida, A; Kawahata, N; Hashimoto, R; Obayashi, T",Tanaka,"We present three patients who showed, in addition to signs of callosal interruption, a variety of abnormal motor behaviour of the left hand dissociated from conscious volition, in the absence of pathological grasping phenomena. The abnormal movements of the left hand consisted of (i) antagonistic movements to the right; (ii) non-antagonistic, irrelevant movements to the right; (iii) symmetric movements to the right in which the left hand sometimes preceded the right, and (iv) occasional inability to move at will during a bimanual task. From these observations and a review of previous publications, we propose that, in most right-handed subjects; diagonistic dyspraxia could be defined as abnormal motor behaviour of the left hand activated by voluntary movements of the right hand. Motor phenomena similar to diagonistic dyspraxia but attributable to impulsive groping movements induced by medial frontal lobe pathology should be excluded from diagonistic dyspraxia. Comparison of MRIs of the three patients with those of five patients who developed no diagonistic dyspraxia following an infarction of the corpus callosum, with or without medial hemispheric involvement, revealed that damage to the ventral part of the posterior end of the body of the corpus callosum was crucial for the development of diagonistic dyspraxia. Since the commissural fibres between the superior parietal lobules pass through the caudal part of the body of the corpus callosum, and also since there is accumulating evidence that the human superior parietal lobule is concerned with selection of movement based on the integration of visual and/or somatosensory information, we infer that diagonistic dyspraxia is produced by a disconnection of the right superior parietal lobule from the left which is dominant for volitional control of movement in most right-handed subjects.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/119.3.859,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

The most widely recognized variants in literature are frontal, callosal, and posterior AHS. AHS due to the corpus callosum lesion can occur alone or as part of callosal disconnection syndrome (CDS). This report presents a unique CDS case manifesting clinical features from all three AHS variants, resulting from an extensive corpus callosum infarct. Our patient exhibited various clinical features from the three AHS variants, which include grasping, groping, and difficulty releasing objects from the hand (anterior); intermanual conflict (callosal); arm levitation, mild hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss (posterior). Additionally, the extensive disruption of the corpus callosal fibers produced neurological manifestations of CDS, such as cognitive impairment, ideomotor and constructional apraxia, behavioral disorder, and transcortical motor aphasia. We employed a range of rehabilitation interventions, such as mirror box therapy, limb restraint strategy, verbal cue training, cognitive behavioral therapy, bimanual hand training, speech and language therapy, and pharmacological treatment with clonazepam. The patient showed almost complete resolution of CDS and AHS features by nine months post-stroke Our case report highlights distinctive clinical variations of AHS and the challenging correlation between clinical manifestations and neuroanatomical substrates. Future studies are necessary to explore the intricate neural connections and the precise function of the corpus callosum. This can be achieved by combining comprehensive neuropsychological testing with diffusion tensor tractography studies. It is also essential to develop a validated tool to standardize AHS assessment.

25684297,Joseph Haydn's encephalopathy: new aspects.,"Blahak, Christian; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Hennerici, Michael G",Blahak,"With increasing age, Joseph Haydn complained of progressive forgetfulness preventing him from composing for about the last 8 years of his life. He spent his days more and more inactive and immobilized, suffering from a disabling gait disturbance. Still, most biographers consider diffuse atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure to be reasons for Haydn's medical condition and physical decline during the last years of his life. A more sophisticated and detailed inspection of documents and sources, however, leads to the diagnosis of subcortical vascular encephalopathy (SVE), caused by progressive cerebral small vessel disease. Important features of the disease are mood changes, urinary symptoms, and in particular a characteristic gait disturbance, while dementia is only mild and occurs later in the course. Haydn was severely disabled by the symptoms of SVE for several years and often reported difficulties in the completion of his last oratorio ""Die Jahreszeiten"" (The Seasons). Subsequently, the disease prevented him from composing another large oratorio, ""Das jüngste Gericht"" (The last judgement), which had been already drafted. Finally, the progress of SVE stopped his long career as a composer and conductor at the age of 73 years.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Progress in brain research,10.1016/bs.pbr.2014.11.013,,Haydn; depression; dyspraxia; emotional lability; gait disorder; lacunar strokes; small vessel disease; subcortical vascular encephalopathy; white matter lesions,Biography; Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Portrait,Netherlands,eng

31621626,"Cerebrovascular pathology presenting as corticobasal syndrome: An autopsy case series of ""vascular CBS"".","Koga, Shunsuke; Roemer, Shanu F; Kasanuki, Koji; Dickson, Dennis W",Koga,"The corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is heterogeneous in terms of postmortem neuropathology. While it has been previously studied with antemortem neuroimaging, clinicopathologic features of corticobasal syndrome associated with cerebrovascular pathology (vascular CBS) have yet to be reported. To identify vascular CBS, we searched the database of the CurePSP Brain Bank for patients with a clinical diagnosis of CBS who failed to meet neuropathologic criteria for corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or other neurodegenerative disease processes, but who had significant cerebrovascular pathology. Hemibrains were assessed macroscopically and processed for histological assessment. Medical records were reviewed to characterize clinical features of vascular CBS. Of 217 patients with an antemortem diagnosis of CBS, we identified three patients with vascular CBS. Multiple infarcts in the watershed regions (frontal lobe and motor cortex), periventricular white matter, thalamus, and basal ganglia were observed in two patients. One patient had no cortical infarcts, but had multiple white matter infarcts and corticospinal tract degeneration. All were clinically thought to have CBS based on progressive asymmetric motor symptoms, including rigidity and apraxia, as well as cognitive impairment. Antemortem imaging studies showed findings of chronic cerebrovascular disease, with infarcts or white matter pathology. This autopsy study of vascular CBS shows that, while rare, cerebrovascular pathology involving the frontal lobe, white matter tracts, basal ganglia, thalamus, and corticospinal tract can underlie clinical features suggestive of CBS. When neuroimaging suggests an alternative explanation, including chronic infarcts in critical regions, caution is merited in considering CBD as the underlying pathology.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2019.09.001,PMC7141792,Cerebrovascular pathology; Corticobasal syndrome (CBS); Corticospinal tract degeneration; Vascular parkinsonism; Wallerian degeneration,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Patients availing dementia care service from three tertiary care hospitals, across Kerala, with a diagnosis of psychosis were evaluated. Three patients with NPH, diagnosed as per the consensus criteria, presenting as psychosis are described. Patient 1: Fifty-five-year-old lady with psychosis was found to have iNPH. She gave history of psychosis relieved with successful shunting of the hydrocephalus. She developed recurrence of psychosis each time the hydrocephalus recurred due to shunt malfunction and was relieved with correction of hydrocephalus with shunting. Patient 2 was a 67-year-old gentleman with long history of pyschosis with paranoid ideas. Five years after onset of illness, he developed gait apraxia, and a CT scan done showed normal pressure hydrocephalus. Patient 3 had bipolar illness since age of 60 years of age. He also developed gait apraxia 5 years into the illness and was diagnosed as having iNPH following imaging. All the patients had psychosis much before other features of iNPH developed. One of the patient's psychosis was temporally associated with onset and offset of hydrocephalus, thereby strongly supporting the causative nature of iNPH. iNPH though rare can be one of the causes for late onset secondary psychosis.",{},,Neurology India,10.4103/0028-3886.329621,,Dementia; normal pressure hydrocephalus; psychosis; shunt,Case Reports; Journal Article,India,eng

By extensively examining a patient with AHS we provide novel neuropsychological and lesion mapping data that shed new light on the possibility of modulating specific symptoms associated with AHS, in particular unilateral apraxia and magnetic apraxia. Moreover, we compared lesion mapping data with an in depth analysis of previous studies in order to explore the neural network responsible for the complex symptomatology associated with this syndrome. We found that non-primarily motor variables (e.g. the nature of the object to be grasped and integration of visuo-spatial feedback in action) play an important role in determining AHS symptomatology. Moreover, we found that lesions involving various different parts of the motor control network (the corpus callosum, the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, the parietal areas and thalamus) are closely linked to partially differing AHS symptoms. The comparison of our data with those reported in previous studies indicate that AHS is a multifaceted and complex syndrome in which the influence of non-primarily motor, emotional and higher-order components may be largely underestimated.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.10.005,,Anarchic hand syndrome; Dangerous stimulus; Magnetic apraxia; Unilateral apraxia; Visual observation perspective,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

Case 3 is of a 64-year-old female, a known patient of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis, who presented with psychomotor withdrawal, depression, and cautious gait. One of the most prevalent forms of dementia in adults is vascular dementia, often caused by multiple small strokes, termed multi-infarct dementia. Strategic infarct dementia, on the other hand, is usually caused by a small, single cerebral infarct. The strategic brain regions specifically involved in post-stroke cognitive impairment requires detailed clinical examination along with radiological imaging for accurate localization.

Such deficits may persist long after a patient has been discharged from the hospital and can significantly impact return to work, resumption of prior social roles, and interpersonal relations, as well as full engagement in leisure activities. While considerable research has centered on identifying and describing communication impairments in brain tumor survivors, relatively little research has investigated language therapy for this population. <b>Aims:</b> This report (1) reviews the literature and describes the language and cognitive-communicative profile of a 35-year-old man 6 years post glioblastoma excision with subsequent chemo- and radiation therapies; (2) presents cognitive-communication outcome data for this individual following an integrated discourse therapy; and (3) assesses treatment feasibility in face-to-face (F2F) and tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) contexts. <b>Methods:</b> A battery of tests and weekly conversation probes were administered to evaluate baseline performance and potential changes associated with F2F and TNR treatment delivery. Integrated Conversation Therapy (ICT) was administered across four alternating (F2F and TNR) treatment blocks over 2 months. ICT is a solution-focused discourse intervention that simultaneously targets word finding, sentence processing, and authentic patient-selected conversational interactions. <b>Results:</b> Although the participant presented with long term-language impairments that were clinically distinct from stroke-associated aphasia, statistically significant post-treatment gains (>2 SEM) were evident following F2F and TNR treatment delivery on standardized measures of apraxia, discourse production, verbal memory, and self-ratings of discourse production, communication, and living with aphasia. While objective measures of treatment effect size (probes of CIU discourse data) were consistent across F2F and TNR delivery models, results of a satisfaction survey indicated a slight but statistically significant participant preference for TNR treatment delivery. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides preliminary support for F2F and TNR delivery of ICT discourse intervention for glioblastoma survivors. It also highlights the need for more research specifically dedicated to language therapy for this population.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.583452,PMC7710897,aphasia; case report; discourse; language; telerehabilitation; therapy; tumor,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Over time, several other tumor entities have been identified to metabolize 5-ALA and show a similar fluorescence pattern during surgical resection. This case report is the first description of 5-ALA accumulation in postischemic cerebral tissue. This evidence questions the assumption that 5-ALA accumulation in glioma is exclusively attributed to tumor infiltration. Instead, 5-ALA accumulation can also occur beyond the tumor borders and may be partially ascribed to inflammatory changes in the surrounding brain tissue. A 64-year old woman presented with episodes of apraxia and a ring-enhancing lesion in postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences suggestive of high grade glioma. Strong fluorescence was observed during 5-ALA-guided resection. However, although the frozen section was inconclusive, the final histopathologic examination revealed a stage II cerebral infarction. 5-ALA accumulation in postischemic cerebral tissue should be considered for intended supramarginal resections near eloquent brain regions. Therefore, sufficient preoperative imaging should regularly include magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy and perfusion sequences to ascertain the proper diagnosis. Moreover, further research is warranted to determine the role of 5-ALA accumulation in postischemic and inflammatory brain tissue.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.009,,5-ALA; Cerebral infarction; Fluorescence-guided surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

25318773,Occurrence of communication and swallowing problems in neurological disorders: analysis of forty patients.,"Jani, Mansi Pankaj; Gore, Geeta Bharat",Jani,"Communication and swallowing problems are common as a result of neurological conditions like stroke, traumatic brain injury, neoplasms of the nervous systems, viral encephalitis, diseases affecting neuromuscular junction and neuro degenerative conditions. The most frequently encountered problems are dysarthria, aphasia, dysphagia and apraxia of speech. Although these disorders are mentioned in literature, very few studies describing the occurrence in different neurological conditions are available in Indian context. Hence, a need was felt to carry out such a study. A heterogenous group of forty patients with neurological conditions were assessed for presence of speech, language and swallowing problems. A percent analysis was carried out to determine the occurrence of aphasia, dysarthria and dysphagia in general, in specific diseases and also to describe type of aphasia and dysarthria according to the characteristics presented. It was seen that the most frequently occurring disorder was dysarthria (60%), followed by dysphagia (55%) and aphasia (18%). It was also noted that dysarthria and dysphagia co-existed in around 45% patients with neurological diseases. It can be concluded that speech, language and swallowing problems are frequent in individuals with neurological conditions. Speech language pathologist plays an important role as a member of the rehabilitation team in a neurological setup with respect to identifying these problems and initiating intervention at the earliest. Hence, it is necessary for speech language pathologist to be well versed with the features each disorder may present with in terms of communication and swallowing.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-141165,,Neurological disorders; aphasia; dysarthria; dysphagia; speech language pathologist,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The possibility of occurrence of apraxia of speech (AOS) following right hemisphere lesion is discussed in the context of known occurrences of ideomotor apraxias and acquired neurogenic stuttering in several cases with right hemisphere lesion. A current hypothesis on AOS-the dual route speech encoding (DRSE) hypothesis-and predictions based on DRSE were utilized to explore the nature of CAS in SE. One prediction based on the DRSE hypothesis is that there should be no difference in the frequency of occurrence of apraxic errors on words and non-words. This prediction was tested using a repetition task. The experimental stimuli included a list of minimal pairs that signaled voice-voiceless contrasts in words and non-words. Minimal-pair stimuli were presented orally, one at a time. SE's responses were recorded using audio and videotapes. Results indicate that SE's responses were characterized by numerous voicing errors. Most importantly, production of real word minimal pairs was superior to that of non-word minimal pairs. Implications of these results for the DRSE hypothesis are discussed with regard to currently developing perspectives on AOS.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2004.02.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report here an oculomotor and computational study of a patient with a long lasting form of DD. A first series of oculomotor paradigms revealed marked and unprecedented saccade impairments. We used a computational model in order to provide information about the impaired decision-making process: the analysis of saccade latencies revealed that variations of decision times were explained by adjustments of response criterion. This result and paradoxical impairments observed in additional oculomotor paradigms allowed to propose that this adjustment of the criterion level resulted from the co-existence of counteracting oculomotor programs, consistent with the existence of antagonist programs in homotopic cortical areas. In the intact brain, trans-hemispheric inhibition would allow suppression of these counter programs. Depending on the topography of the disconnected areas, various motor and/or behavioural impairments would arise in split-brain subjects. In motor systems, such conflict would result in increased criteria for desired movement execution (oculomotor system) or in simultaneous execution of counteracting movements (skeletal motor system). At higher cognitive levels, it may result in conflict of intentions.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.04.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

A 49-year-old man underwent comprehensive rehabilitation at a local rehabilitation hospital since 3 weeks after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. However, he could not walk independently because of severe motor weakness in his right leg until 19 months after the onset. At the beginning of rehabilitation at our hospital (19 months after onset), we thought that he had the neurological potential to walk independently because the unaffected (right) corticospinal tract and corticoreticulospinal tract were closely related to the gait potential, representing intact integrities. As a result, we assumed that the severe motor weakness in the right leg was mainly ascribed to LKA. At our hospital, he underwent comprehensive rehabilitation including increased doses of dopaminergic drugs (pramipexole, ropinirole, amantadine, and carbidopa/levodopa). After 10 days to our hospital, he could walk independently on an even floor with verbal supervision, concurrent with motor recovery of the right leg. After 24 days after hospital admission, he could walk independently on an even floor. We believe that the resolution of LKA in his right leg by the administration of adequate doses of dopaminergic drugs was the main reason for the delayed gait recovery in this patient. The results suggest the importance of detecting the neurological potential for gait ability of a stroke patient who cannot walk after the gait recovery phase and the causes of gait inability for individual patients.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000028711,PMC8797483,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The kanji and kana he was unable to write were inconsistent over time: in some cases he was unable to write words he had successfully written a week before, and vice versa.

The background pathology of CBS is commonly a variety of proteinopathies, but association with cerebrovascular disease has also been reported. Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (FCMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by facio-pharyngo-glossal diplegia with automatic-voluntary movement dissociation presenting with bilateral paresis of the facial, lingual, pharyngeal and masticatory muscles. FCMS is commonly attributable to stroke. Transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) proteinopathy is also known as the pathological background of FCMS, while the pathological background of the majority of CBS cases consists of diverse tauopathies instead of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this report, we describe a case mimicking FCMS that was finally diagnosed as CBS with suggested 4-repeat tauopathy.

26928117,Callosal apraxia: a 34-year follow-up study.,"Falchook, Adam D; Watson, Robert T; Heilman, Kenneth M",Falchook,"Loss of ability of the left upper limb (LUL) to correctly produce spatial and temporal components of skilled purposeful movements was reported 34 years ago in a woman with a callosal infarction. To learn about recovery, we recently reexamined this woman. This woman was tested for ideomotor apraxia by asking her to pantomime to command and to seeing pictures of tools. Whereas she performed normally with her right upper limb, her LUL remained severely apraxic, making many spatial (postural and movement) errors. Initially, she did not reveal loss of finger-hand deftness (limb-kinetic apraxia), and when tested again with the coin rotation task, her left hand performance was normal. Without vision, she could name objects placed in her left hand but not name numbers written in this hand. Since this woman had a callosal lesion, failure to recover cannot be accounted for by left hemisphere inhibition of her right hemisphere. Although failure for her LUL to improve may have been related to not using her LUL for skilled actions, her right hemisphere was able to observe transitive actions, and this failure of her LUL to produce skilled purposeful movements suggests her right hemisphere may have not had the capacity to learn these movement representations. Without vision, her ability to recognize objects with her left hand, but not numbers written on her left palm, suggests graphesthesia may require that her left hand did not have access to movement representations important for programming these numbers when writing.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2016.1148743,,Corpus callosum; agraphesthesia; agraphia; ideomotor apraxia; limb kinetic apraxia,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report the recovery of language function in a patient with chronic aphasia who was evaluated in the baseline assessment as having reached a plateau. The patient with subcortical aphasia was a 62-year-old, right-handed man. At 192 days after left putamen hemorrhage, he visited our hospital to begin CIAT. The patient's language and speech abilities were evaluated 1 month before and immediately before the start of CIAT. To evaluate the training effect, language function was assessed immediately after, 1 month after, 3 months after, and 6 months after the end of CIAT. The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), the single-word-naming task in the Test of Lexical Processing in Aphasia (TLPA), and the Verbal Activity Log (VAL) were used to assess his language function and the amount of spoken language. From 1 month before CIAT to 6 months after CIAT, the WAB Aphasia Quotient increased by 6.1 points. Compared with before therapy, the errors of apraxia of speech in the TLPA disappeared from immediately after to 6 months after CIAT. Although the VAL score at 3 months after CIAT was higher than that before the start of CIAT, the score decreased after 6 months because of reduced opportunities for communication with friends.

Ideomotor apraxia (IMA) is a common sequela of left-brain damage that comprises a deficit in the ability to perform gestures to verbal commands or by imitation. This study elucidated whether crossover learning occurred in two post-stroke IMA patients without motor paralysis after gesture training approximately 2 months after stroke onset. We quantitatively analysed the therapeutic intervention history and investigated whether revised action occurred during gesture production. Treatment intervention was to examine how to influence improvement and generalisation of the ability to produce the gesture. This study used an alternating treatments single-subject design, and the intervention method was errorless learning. Results indicated crossover learning in both patients. Qualitative analysis indicated that revised action occurred during the gesture-production process in one patient and that there were two types of post-revised action gestures: correct and incorrect gestures. We also discovered that even when a comparably short time had elapsed since stroke onset, generalisation was difficult. Information transfer between the left and right hemispheres of the brain via commissural fibres is important in crossover learning. In conclusion, improvements in gesture-production skill should be made with reference to the left cerebral hemisphere disconnection hypothesis.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2015.1113186,,Apraxia; Crossover learning; Gesture training; Single case experimental design study; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

An alternative hypothesis posits that phonemic paraphasia arises from difficulty converting phonemes into their corresponding articulatory maneuvers. However, detailed case studies supporting this theory have been lacking. In this report, we present the case of a 61-year-old right-handed man with right temporo-parietal infarction who exhibited crossed aphasia characterized by typical conduction aphasia symptoms (eg, relatively fluent speech with intact comprehension, frequent phonemic paraphasia, and pronounced difficulties in oral repetition) in the absence of distorted articulation, syllable segmentation, and prosody impairment. Despite the frequent occurrence of phonemic paraphasia and articulatory challenges, our patient's phonological representations remained relatively intact. His phonemic paraphasia was often self-corrected to produce correct responses, a feature known as conduit d'approche. During the oral repetition of individual mora (ie, the smallest unit of speech in Japanese), we observed that the patient consistently traced the corresponding Hiragana phonetic symbol accurately, despite his difficulties in articulation. We substantiated this phenomenon through objective assessment and posit that it resulted from an unusual separation of language functions in crossed aphasia-specifically, a disconnection between phonological representations in the right temporo-parietal cortex and speech articulation engrams in the left hemisphere. In this case of conduction aphasia, articulatory-based phonemic paraphasia may be viewed as an inability to convert phonemes into the appropriate articulatory maneuvers rather than as phonological representation dysfunction or apraxia of speech.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000371,,,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

Connectivity was assessed pre- and post-training in the α- and the β-bands within the auditory-motor network using magnetoencephalography while participants were passively listening to a standardized melody. Changes in manual dexterity, grip strength, movement coordination, and use of the upper extremity were also documented in both stroke survivors.

We report on a patient with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and complete monoplegia due to LKA, which was mainly ascribed to injury of the CFT from the secondary motor area using diffusion tensor tractography. A 35-year-old male was struck by a car from the side during riding an autocycle and received direct head trauma as a result of falling to ground. He lost consciousness for approximately 1 month and experienced continuous post-traumatic amnesia after the accident. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 and he showed quadriparesis including complete monoplegia of his left arm since the onset of TBI. The patient diagnosed complete monoplegia due to LKA after traumatic brain injury. He underwent conservative management for TBI followed by rehabilitation at approximately 2 months after onset. At 32-month after onset, weakness on left arm (Manual Muscle Test [MMT]:0) and partial weakness of left leg (MMT:3). Results of electromyography and nerve conduction studies of left extremities were normal. Motor evoked potential values obtained from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) were: right APB latency 22.3msec, amplitude 1.6mV; left APB latency 22.8msec, amplitude 1.5mV. After 2 weeks of administration of dopaminergic drugs for improvement of LKA, left arm weakness had recovered to level that permitted movement against gravity (MMT:3). Diffusion tensor tractography at 32-month after onset showed right corticospinal tract discontinuation at the pontine level and partial tearing of the left corticospinal tract at the subcortical white matter. In addition, the left CFT from the supplementary motor area showed partial tearing at the subcortical white matter. The LKA due to injury of the left supplementary motor area-CFT was demonstrated in a patient with complete monoplegia following TBI. Accurate diagnosis of LKA is important for successful rehabilitation because LKA is known to respond to dopaminergic drug treatment.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000022452,PMC7717717,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Since the right hemisphere is dominant for mediating motor persistence, callosal lesions that disconnect the left hemisphere from the right may induce impersistence of the right upper and lower limbs. After an undiagnosed left callosal infarction, a 65-year-old right-handed man suddenly developed a transient loss of volitional movement of his left leg. Five days after onset, he was admitted to our hospital with signs of callosal disconnection: left-hand agraphia and apraxia, left-hand tactile anomia, failures on cross-replication of hand postures, and intermanual conflict. He had neither weakness nor ataxia of his upper or lower extremities, but when asked to keep his arms or legs extended he could not maintain his right arm and leg in the extended position, suggesting motor impersistence in his dominant limbs. When we examined him 3 months after onset, the motor impersistence had disappeared.

25921790,The role of movement representation in episodic memory for actions: A study of patients with apraxia.,"Masumoto, Kouhei; Shirakawa, Masayuki; Higashiyama, Takeshi; Yokoyama, Kazumasa",Masumoto,"In attempting to memorize a sentence about an action, such as ""Pick up the glass,"" performing the action (motor encoding) results in better memory performance than simply memorizing the words (verbal encoding). Such enhancement of memory is known as the enactment effect. Several theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon using concepts such as physical motor information associated with speed, form, amplitude of movement and/or movement representations involved in movement imaging, knowledge on manipulating tools, and spatial relationships in the enactment effect. However, there have been no cognitive neuropsychological studies investigating whether the enactment effect is crucially influenced by physical motor information or movement representations. To clarify this issue, we compared healthy adult control participants with two different types of apraxia patients. One patient with left hemisphere lesions caused by cerebral infarction had a disability involving multiple movement representations. The other patient showed symptoms of corticobasal syndrome and was not able to benefit from feedback on the accuracy of her motor movements during enactment. Participants memorized action sentences via either verbal or motor encoding and responded to recall and recognition tests. Results indicated that the patient with the movement representation deficits exhibited worse memory performance than the other patient or control participants following both verbal and motor encoding. Although the enactment effect was present during recall in both patients, the effect was not observed for recognition in the patient with severe movement representation deficits. These results suggest that movement representations are involved in encoding episodic memories of action. Moreover, the role of movement representations appears to depend on the form of retrieval that is being used.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/13803395.2015.1024102,,Apraxia; Enactment effect; Memory of actions; Movement representation; Subject-performed task,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Here we describe three cases of patients who developed severe dysarthria, temporarily mimicking speech arrest or aphemia, due to a localized brain lesion near the left face representation of the human primary motor cortex (face-M1). Speech was slow, effortful, lacking normal prosody, and more affected than expected from the degree of facial or tongue palsy. There was a mild deficit in tongue movements in the sagittal plane that impaired palatolingual contact and rapid tongue movements. The speech disturbance was limited to verbal output, without aphasia or orofacial apraxia. Overlay of magnetic resonance images revealed a localized cortical region near face-M1, which displayed high intensity on diffusion weighted images, while the main portion of the corticobulbar fibers arising from the lower third of the motor cortex was preserved.

Furthermore, detailed evaluation of the conceptual praxis system revealed that despite an almost complete inability to perform transitive movements accurately, abstract knowledge of tool function and action was remarkably well preserved. The critical dissociation between intact conceptual knowledge of action and impaired movement execution documented in this case points to a fundamental competence/performance dichotomy in apraxia and provides empirical support for cognitive models of praxis that divide the action system into distinct conceptual and production subcomponents.

25046697,Pure associative tactile agnosia for the left hand: clinical and anatomo-functional correlations.,"Veronelli, Laura; Ginex, Valeria; Dinacci, Daria; Cappa, Stefano F; Corbo, Massimo",Veronelli,"Associative tactile agnosia (TA) is defined as the inability to associate information about object sensory properties derived through tactile modality with previously acquired knowledge about object identity. The impairment is often described after a lesion involving the parietal cortex (Caselli, 1997; Platz, 1996). We report the case of SA, a right-handed 61-year-old man affected by first ever right hemispheric hemorrhagic stroke. The neurological examination was normal, excluding major somaesthetic and motor impairment; a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a right subacute hemorrhagic lesion limited to the post-central and supra-marginal gyri. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation detected a selective inability to name objects when handled with the left hand in the absence of other cognitive deficits. A series of experiments were conducted in order to assess each stage of tactile recognition processing using the same stimulus sets: materials, 3D geometrical shapes, real objects and letters. SA and seven matched controls underwent the same experimental tasks during four sessions in consecutive days. Tactile discrimination, recognition, pantomime, drawing after haptic exploration out of vision and tactile-visual matching abilities were assessed. In addition, we looked for the presence of a supra-modal impairment of spatial perception and of specific difficulties in programming exploratory movements during recognition. Tactile discrimination was intact for all the stimuli tested. In contrast, SA was able neither to recognize nor to pantomime real objects manipulated with the left hand out of vision, while he identified them with the right hand without hesitations. Tactile-visual matching was intact. Furthermore, SA was able to grossly reproduce the global shape in drawings but failed to extract details of objects after left-hand manipulation, and he could not identify objects after looking at his own drawings. This case confirms the existence of selective associative TA as a left hand-specific deficit in recognizing objects. This deficit is not related to spatial perception or to the programming of exploratory movements. The cross-modal transfer of information via visual perception permits the activation of a partially degraded image, which alone does not allow the proper recognition of the initial tactile stimulus.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.06.015,,Apraxia; Cross-modal transfer; Parietal lobe; Somatosensory perception; Tactile agnosia; Tactile object recognition,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

A fundamental issue is to understand the residual capacity of those LBD patients in tool selection. Three LBD patients with tool use disorders, three right brain-damaged (RBD) patients, and six matched healthy controls performed a novel tool selection task, consisting in extracting a target out from a box by selecting the relevant tool among eight, four, or two tools. Three criteria were manipulated to make relevant and irrelevant tools (size, rigidity, shape). LBD patients selected a greater number of irrelevant tools and had more difficulties to solve the task compared to RBD patients and controls. All participants committed more errors for selecting relevant tools based on rigidity and shape than size. In some LBD patients, the difficulties persisted even in the 2-Choice condition. Our findings confirm that tool use disorders result from impaired technical reasoning, leading patients to meet difficulties in selecting tools based on their physical properties. We also go further by showing that these difficulties can decrease as the choice is reduced, at least for some properties, opening new avenues for rehabilitation programs.

Nonetheless, there is a shortcoming in research and availability of applicable trainings. Further, to date, anosognosia for limb apraxia has largely been neglected. Therefore, we developed a <i>Naturalistic Action Therapy</i> that trains object selection and application with an errorless learning approach and which includes supported self-evaluation. The current study presents the results of two stroke patients participating in the training. The procedure entailed two baseline and one post-training sessions including standardized limb apraxia and anosognosia assessments as well as 18 naturalistic action tasks. The training consisted of 15 sessions during which 4-6 of the 18 naturalistic action tasks (e.g., pour water into a glass, make a phone call) were trained. Both patients showed improvement in trained and untrained tasks as well as in standardized apraxia and anosognosia assessments. Training effects appeared strongest for the trained items. The procedure is documented in detail and easy to administer and thus may have the potential to be applied by relatives. The results of this pilot-study are promising and suggest that the approach is suitable for further evaluation.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2019.1628075,,Anosognosia for apraxia; Naturalistic Action Therapy; limb apraxia; rehabilitation; tool-use,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Neuropsychological testing, clinical examination, MRI, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were performed in a right-handed patient with acute onset of left-sided sensorimotor hemiparesis due to a right hemisphere ischemic stroke. Deficits in the execution of meaningless and meaningful gestures were not detected properly on initial clinical examination but were revealed later on through neuropsychological testing. Instead, the patient's inability to respond to specific instructions in the acute care setting was mistaken to reflect severe deficits in auditory comprehension. fMRI revealed right-hemispheric localization of language in the right-handed patient. We suggest including a bedside test for limb apraxia symptoms in acute clinical care of stroke patients. The distinction between deficits in limb praxis and impairments of language can be complicated owing to the common hemispheric co-localization of the two functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2012.741253,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, language has the capacity to influence the selection of purposeful actions. The abilities to use language and to program purposeful movements are often mediated by networks that have anatomic proximity. With hemispheric injury, the diagnosis of apraxia is often confounded by the specific influence of language impairments on the ability to select and produce transitive gestures. We report a patient who illustrates this confound. This patient is a right-handed man who developed global aphasia and neglect after a right hemispheric stroke. His right hand remained deft, and when asked to produce specific transitive gestures (pantomimes), he often performed normally but did make some body part as object and perseverative errors. However, he did not demonstrate the temporal or spatial errors typical of ideomotor apraxia. He also had a perseverative agraphia. Our patient's left hemisphere praxis system appeared to be intact, and the error types demonstrated during production of transitive gestures cannot be attributed to a degradation of postural and movement (praxis) programs mediated by his left hemisphere. The praxis errors types are most consistent with a deficit in the ability to select the necessary praxis programs. Thus, our patient appeared to have dissociation between language and praxis programs that resulted in body part as object and perseverative errors.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770883,PMC3732537,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

Neurological examination revealed disturbed vertical gaze, dysarthria, rigidity of the right upper extremity, and bilateral instinctive grasp reaction. Neuropsychological assessment disclosed Broca's aphasia, buccofacial apraxia, and memory disturbance. MRI of the brain showed atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes, which was more severe on the left than on the right, especially the left inferior frontal gyrus. In most reported cases of CBD, the initial symptom is motor dysfunction of the unilateral upper or lower extremity. However, we should be cautious that among cases with CBD, there have been rare cases that begin with progressive aphasia alone. In our case, the atrophied region of the cerebral cortex was most severe around the left inferior frontal gyrus. In a few reported cases with the initial symptom of aphasia, the atrophied region corresponded considerably to the type of the aphasia. On the other hand, in those whose initial symptom was mainly motor dysfunction of the unilateral extremity, the atrophied region was remarkable in the posterior part of the frontal lobe and parietal lobe. Therefore, we suggest that in CBD the distribution of the cerebral cortical lesions differs in accordance with whether the initial symptom is motor disturbance or aphasia, and that the type of aphasia corresponds to the location of the cortical lesion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

In 2002, after the infectious, flu-like disease, she revealed arthritis and drowsiness, also with memory and language impairment. The patient continued to have symptoms consistent with previously examined clumsiness. She was diagnosed with Lyme via ELISA and PCR, and treated. She made a full recovery from acute symptoms. After a few months, neurological and neuropsychological examinations were performed. On the background of mild cognitive decline apraxia and difficulties of attention were noted as the main problems. A apraxia of the right hand complicated the patient's life and depreciated her quality of life. The patient underwent MRI examination. FSE, FAST and FLAIR sequences were made. The MRI demonstrated the appearance of several small hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the left and right frontal and left parietal lobe. These lesions were typical of the post-inflammatory leucoencephalopathy. Additionally, a ring-shaped, low-intensity lesion in the posterior part of the left parietal lobe was noticed. The lesion was 8 mm in diameter and described to be an old toxoplasmosis lesion. The patient had been treated and the symptoms consistent with Lyme disease resolved.

The lesions were classified into three categories (slight, moderate and severe). Only two of our patients had clinical features considered to be typical of CBD. Severe lesions were present in the posterior portions of the frontal lobe, anterior to the precentral gyrus in two patients with the clinical diagnosis of CBD. By comparison, in two patients with clinically diagnosed frontal Pick's disease, and one with the clinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), severe lesions were seen in the anterior portions of the frontal lobe. The primary motor area of all five had mostly slight to moderate lesions. We postulate that the clinical features of CBD have a much wider spectrum than previously believed. Our data also indicate that the lesion responsible for limb-kinetic apraxia in CBD is in the premotor cortex. We suggest that when the anterior portions of the frontal lobe are damaged, the clinical picture mimics those of Pick's disease and PSP. In addition, we consider that focal cerebral atrophy of CBD is multicentric.",{},,Acta neuropathologica,10.1007/s004010050728,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
32590249,Using tools effectively despite defective hand posture: A single-case study.,"Lesourd, Mathieu; Naëgelé, Bernadette; Jaillard, Assia; Detante, Olivier; Osiurak, François",Lesourd,"Apraxia, a cognitive disorder of motor control, can severely impair transitive actions (object-related) and may lead to action errors (e.g., rubbing a hammer on a nail instead of pounding it) and hand posture errors (e.g., grasping a tool in a wrong way). Here, we report a rare observation of a left-handed patient, left-lateralized for language, who developed a severe apraxia following a right brain lesion. Interestingly the patient showed a significant number of hand posture errors, while she perfectly demonstrated the actual use of tools. This case stressed the predictions made by the current theories of tool use. According to the manipulation-based approach, the hand posture errors should be associated with an impaired manipulation knowledge. According to the reasoning-based approach, the absence of action errors should be associated with spared mechanical knowledge. Moreover, to better understand the neurocognitive origins of the deficit observed in VF, we examined several potential brain lateralization of praxis functions. We initiated a systematic examination of VF's performance in several contexts of tool use allowing us to investigate which kinds of tool-use representations were potentially impaired in VF. Our investigation did not reveal any major deficit of manipulation knowledge. This can hardly account for the high frequency of hand posture errors, contrary to the predictions of the manipulation-based approach. In contrast, in line with the reasoning-based approach, mechanical knowledge was spared and can explain the absence of action errors. We also found that VF probably had a bilateral organization of praxis functions, but irrespective of the possible brain lateralization considered, none of which established a satisfactory association between manipulation knowledge and hand posture errors. Taken together, the manipulation-based approach fails to explain fully the deficit presented by this patient and should lead us to consider alternative explanations.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.04.023,,Action errors; Apraxia; Hand posture errors; Manipulation knowledge; Tool use,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

At the age of 54, he presented with resting tremor in the hand and foot on the left, and gradual slowness in voluntary movements. Two years later, resting tremor involved the right foot, and an expressionless face and frozen gait occurred. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was made and treatment with L-dopa and carbidopa resulted in conspicuous improvement. At the age of 57, he developed compulsive repetitions of syllables, words and phrases, and sentences infrequently when he spoke. They have been persisting for four years. Repetitions increased in spontaneous speech while they decreased in oral reading and repetition of sentences. These repetitions in speech were symptomatologically diagnosed as palilalia and acquired stuttering. Brain CT showed slight brain atrophy, and brain MRI disclosed a few lesions indicating lacunae in the left substantia nigra, left putamen, and right internal capsule. SPECT showed a slight decrease in blood flow in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia bilaterally. Full IQ on WAIS was 105, and neither agnosia nor apraxia was detected. Palilalia and acquired stuttering, though the pathomechanism has not been clarified, have been reported to occur usually secondary to cerebral vascucular lesions and very rarely in Parkinson's disease. In the present case, they may have been produced by the parkinsonian nigro-striatal lesions.

The right premotor frontal cortex is commonly assumed to play a secondary role in this system. We describe a patient who developed left upper limb apraxia after a right premotor ischaemic stroke. The neuropsychological examination ruled out impairment of other cognitive functions, including those subserved by the parietal-temporal cortex. Neither pyramidal signs nor interhemispheric transfer syndrome were detected, suggesting that the right primary motor cortex and corpus callosum were intact and that apraxia arose from a right prefrontal cortical lesion. An additional feature was the patient's inability to copy a gesture or posture demonstrated by the examiner (visual input) or to execute a verbal command (auditory input), even though he could copy the position in which the examiner placed his right arm while blindfolded (proprioceptive input). The disturbance was interpreted as ""dissociation apraxia"". To our knowledge this type of dissociation has never been reported in a patient with focal brain damage. The case of this patient highlights the importance of the right premotor cortex in the praxis system, and lends support to the hypothesis of a modular and multimodal organization of brain functioning.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

She was congenitally right-handed. She had been a teacher of Japanese string instrument (samisen) playing and been able to sing Japanese traditional songs well. A tape on which she had recorded her songs one year before the admission also proved her to be a good singer. Neurological examination on admission revealed almost normal findings except for minimal weakness in her left hand fingers. Right temporal lobe hemorrhage was revealed by CT scan. One month after the admission, she complained that she was unable to sing her songs and to play samisen as she used to do. Her intelligence was normal (WAIS VIQ116, PIQ108) and there were no abnormal findings as follows: aprosodia, aphasia, agraphia, memory disturbance, agnosia and ideational, ideomotor, constructional or limb-kinetic apraxia. She could point out her errors while singing. However, musical receptive function was slightly disturbed with tonal memory in Seashore test. When she was asked to sing a song without any instrumental support, she hummed a melody occasionally with wrong pitch, but rhythmically. After hearing a song she knew well, she reproduced it with slight improvement. With the vocal or the instrumental accompaniment, she could sing fairly well. She had some mistakes of pitch while playing a samisen. MRI was performed one year and a half after the brain hemorrhage. It displayed a thin linear of hematoma in the white matter of the right upper temporal and transverse gyrus.

Although apraxia is a key finding for the differential diagnosis of CBD, it has not been determined whether the features of apraxia seen in subjects with CBD are similar to those features exhibited by subjects with left-hemisphere damage from stroke. Therefore, for both clinical purposes and in order to better understand the brain mechanisms that lead to apraxia in CBD, we studied praxis in a patient with CBD and compared him to patients who are apraxic from left-parietal strokes. We used three-dimensional movement analyses to compare the features of apraxic movement. This subject with CBD was a dentist whose initial complaint had been that he ""forgot"" how to use his tools in the mouths of his patients. Analyses were performed on the trajectories made when using a knife to actually slice bread, and when repetitively gesturing slicing made to verbal command. Movements of the left hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder were digitized in 3-D space. Although the CBD subject was clearly apraxic, the features of his apraxia differed markedly from those of the subjects with lesions in the left parietal lobe. For movements to command, the CBD subject showed joint coordination deficits, but his wrist trajectories were produced in the appropriate spatial plane, were correctly restricted to a single plane, and, like control subjects, were linear in path shape. However, when he was actually manipulating the tool and object, all of these aspects of his trajectories became impaired. In contrast, the deficits of the apraxic subjects with left-parietal damage were most pronounced to verbal command with their movements improving slightly although remaining impaired during actual tool and object manipulation. Unlike patients with parietal strokes, patients with CBD have degeneration in several systems and perhaps deficits in these other areas may account for the differences in praxic behavior.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1999.1084,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

The initial left-sided infarct induced right visual neglect, impairment of right-beating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optic ataxia, Gerstmann's syndrome and apraxia. After the right-sided infarct, which occurred six weeks later, bilateral visuo-oculomotor disturbances were observed, including peripheral visual inattention, disorder of visually guided saccades, severe impairment of foveal smooth pursuit and OKN slow phase. The lesion on the left involved the upper part of the angular gyrus and a part of the adjacent superior parietal lobule (SPL). That on the right involved the supramarginal gyrus and extended posteriorly into the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, into both margins of the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and into a small part of the SPL. As the oculomotor deficits and the peripheral visual inattention were bilateral after the second infarct, they probably resulted from the lesion of homologous areas in both cerebral hemispheres. The zone damaged in common included a small part of the SPL, the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, and the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and a small portion of the subcortical white matter. This restricted cerebral zone could therefore, in man, be implicated both in the control of all visually guided eye movements and in visual attention. It is further suggested that two corticofugal pathways are implicated in visually guided saccades, the first arising from the frontal eye fields and projecting directly onto the premotor structures in the brainstem, the second arising from the posterior parietal cortex (probably mainly the intraparietal sulcus adjacent to the angular gyrus) and including a relay in the superior colliculus before reaching the premotor structures.

In contrast, other apraxic subjects may have the movement representations but are unable to utilize the information contained in them to execute skilled purposive movements (production-execution deficit). To learn if the apraxic deficit in CBD is induced by a representational or a production-execution deficit, we tested three nondemented subjects with CBD on tasks requiring production of meaningful or meaningless gestures to command, gesture imitation, gesture discrimination, and novel gesture learning. A fourth subject with incomplete data also is presented. The results suggest that the apraxia associated with CBD is initially induced by a production-execution defect with relative sparing of the movement representations.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1999.1085,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Diagnosis of LKA is made by observation of movements without specific assessment tools. A 44-year-old male underwent conservative management for traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia and subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a pedestrian-car crash. When he was admitted to the rehabilitation department of a university hospital after 41 months after onset, he presented with right hemiparesis (Medical Research Council (MRC): shoulder abductor; 3, elbow flexor; 3, finger extensor; 0, hip flexor; 2- [range: 30°], knee extensor; 1 and ankle dorsiflexor; 3-). In addition, he exhibited slow, clumsy, and mutilated movements when performing movements of his right ankle. The patient was diagnosed as traumatic brain injury (TBI). Clinical assessments and DTI were performed at 41 and 44 months after onset. During three months, rehabilitative therapy was performed including dopaminergic drugs (pramipexole 2.5 mg, ropinirole 2.5 mg, and amantadine 300 mg, and carbidopa/levodopa 75 mg/750 mg). The right leg weakness slowly recovered during 3 months, until 44 months after the initial injury (MRC: shoulder abductor, 3; elbow flexor, 3; finger extensor, 0; hip flexor, 3; knee extensor, 3; and ankle dorsiflexor, 3+). The fiber number of the right corticospinal tract (CST) was decreased on 44-month diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) (1319) compared with 41-month DTT (1470) and the left CST was not reconstructed on both DTTs.

Patients and controls were required to produce both oblique and horizontal/vertical lines that formed a right angle. Planning demands were manipulated across conditions by providing additional spatial information to constrain the drawing. Both patients produced drawings that were less accurate than controls. In addition, ECR was particularly poor at producing oblique lines compared to both RA and controls, even under conditions with minimal planning demands. This pattern of performance is qualitatively similar to that of children under eight years (see Broderick and Laszlo, 1988). Taken together these results provide further evidence that constructional apraxia is not a unitary disorder (with differential performance between patients) and that those differences are not necessarily related to laterality of damage (as both patients had right-hemisphere lesions). We argue for a more quantitative approach to the study of drawing abilities in neuropsychological testing in order to facilitate a finer grained analysis of the disorder and of comparison between patients.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70894-3,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

R.W. showed evidence of retained abilities to access aspects of the forms of spoken words but made numerous phonemic paraphasias in single word production tasks. He did not show features of dysarthria or apraxia of speech. This pattern indicates that his deficit affected a process that plans the phonological forms of spoken words. R.W.'s performances in short-term memory and metalinguistic tasks involving single words were consistent with impaired rehearsal functions. The pattern of results indicates that rehearsal requires planning of the phonological forms of spoken items and suggests that activating entries in the phonological output lexicon is not adequate to permit rehearsal to proceed normally.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1995.1009,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng

12559156,Temporary and permanent signs of interhemispheric disconnection after traumatic brain injury.,"Peru, Andrea; Beltramello, Alberto; Moro, Valentina; Sattibaldi, Lorenzo; Berlucchi, Giovanni",Peru,"The corpus callosum is frequently damaged by closed head traumas, and the resulting deficits of interhemispheric communication may vary according to the specific position of the lesion within the corpus callosum. This paper describes a single case who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury resulting in a lesion of the posterior body of the corpus callosum. Among the classical symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection, left hand anomia, left upper limb ideomotor dyspraxia, left visual field dyslexia and dysnomia, and left ear suppression in a dichotic listening task were observed shortly after the injury but recovered completely or almost completely with the passage of time. The only symptom of interhemispheric disconnection which was found to persist more than 4 years after the injury was an abnormal prolongation of the crossed-uncrossed difference in a simple visuomotor reaction time task. This prolongation was comparable with that observed in subjects with complete callosal lesions or agenesis. The results suggest that the posterior body of the corpus callosum may be an obligatory interhemispheric communication channel for mediating fast visuo-motor responses. The transient nature of other symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection suggests a relatively wide dispersion of fibers with different functions through the callosal body, such that parts of them can survive a restricted lesion and allow functional recovery of hemispheric interactions. An assessment of the evolution in time of symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection following restricted callosal lesions may reveal fine and coarse features of the anatomo-functional topography of the corpus callosum.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00203-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Interestingly, the patient's ability to voluntarily close both eyelids (i.e. blinking) was not affected, indicating that different neural mechanisms control each type of eye closure. The stroke caused damage to a large part of the right frontal cortex, including the motor cortex, pre-motor cortex and the frontal eye field (FEF). The lesion in the left hemisphere was restricted to the FEF. In order to further study the neural mechanisms of eye closure, we conducted an fMRI study in a group of neurological healthy subjects. We found that all areas of the oculomotor cortex were activated by both left and right winking, including the FEF, supplementary eye field (SEF), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Blinking activated FEF and SEF, but not PPC. Both FEF and PPC were significantly more active during winking than blinking.

She was a carrier of HTLV-I virus, and developed subacute right hemiparesis and marked motor aphasia. She had a malignant lymphoma in the left neck and basal cell carcinoma in the right inguinal region. Three months after the onset, she became unable to walk because of the right leg weakness or to speak because of motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal T2-high lesions in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy revealed demyelinating pathology. A biopsy of the left parotid gland revealed a diffuse pleomorphic type large B cell lymphoma. Although anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were found in the blood or CSF. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Neurological examinations revealed severe motor aphasia, mild sensory aphasia/cognitive impairment, right hemiplegia, mild right hemihypesthesia, limb-kinetic apraxia in the left hand, idiomotor apraxia, agraphia, perseveration, marked spasticity and brisk tendon reflex in four extremities, and positive bilateral pathological reflexes. MRI showed multifocal T2-high lesions mainly in the cerebral white matter, predominantly in the left hemisphere, and partly in the cerebral cortex. No gadolinium enhancement was found. In addition, 99mTcECD-SPECT showed a broad decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortex. Anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive but anti-HIV antibody was negative in serum. ATL cells were found in 1-3% of the peripheral white blood cells after admission. CSF examination revealed that the cell count (1/microl), protein level (24 mg/dl), and IgG index (0.4) were all normal. However, the myelin basic protein level (321 pg/ml; normal < 102) was increased, JC virus DNA was detected by PCR, and anti-HTLV-I antibody (x 8) was detected in CSF. The regulatory region of the JC virus DNA in the CSF was partly deleted; immunostaining with anti-JC virus protein antibodies revealed the existence of JC virus in biopsied brain specimens, and these findings were consistent with PML. Her symptoms such as motor aphasia, cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis were subacutely progressive, and she developed akinetic mutism two weeks after admission. Since the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside for PML has been reported, she was administered 80 mg/day of the drug for five days. After treatment, her communication function was mildly improved but the efficacy was transient. Since it has been reported that HTLV-I, as well as HIV, activates the JC virus promoter and its proliferation, the latent infection of HTLV-I in the central nervous system (CNS) in this case might have stimulated the JC virus proliferation, promoting lesion extension over the cerebral cortex. There have been only a few reports of broad decreases in CBF by SPECT in PML patients.

A tentative diagnosis of brain tumor versus brain abscess was made on imaging studies. The patient was finally diagnosed with a tuberculous brain abscess based upon deterioration on imaging and a positive tuberculosis culture. The tuberculous brain abscess was located in the left parietal lobe, which resulted in Gerstmann's syndrome and right-sided apraxia. Stereotactic surgery was performed. He was also given antituberculosis chemotherapy and comprehensive rehabilitation. Considerable improvement was noted after rehabilitation. The patient even returned to a normal life and work.

These features led to the term foreign accent syndrome (FAS), a speech disorder with perceptual features that suggest an indistinct, non-native speaking accent. Also correctly known as psuedoforeign accent, the speech does not typically match a specific foreign accent, but is rather a constellation of speech features that result in the perception of a foreign accent by listeners. The primary etiologies of FAS are cerebrovascular accidents or traumatic brain injuries which affect cortical and subcortical regions critical to expressive speech and language production. Far fewer cases of FAS associated with psychiatric conditions have been reported. We will present the clinical history, neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, cognitive-behavioral and biofeedback assessments, and motor speech examination of a patient with FAS without a known vascular, traumatic, or infectious precipitant. Repeated multidisciplinary examinations of this patient provided convergent evidence in support of FAS secondary to conversion disorder.

17119306,Construction and psychometric properties of a novel test for body representational neglect (Vest Test).,"Glocker, D; Bittl, P; Kerkhoff, G",Glocker,"Multimodal spatial neglect manifests itself also in nonvisual modalities such as audition, touch and body representation. Yet, quantitative tests for the diagnosis of nonvisual neglect are still quite rare. The purpose of the present paper was to develop and evaluate a novel, simple and sensitive test for the assessment of body representational neglect (BRN) in patients with left or right cerebral hemispheric lesions. The vest test covers the front part of the trunk. The blindfolded subject wears the vest and is instructed to pick up all objects from the 24 pockets of the vest (12 on each side) as quickly as possible using the ipsilesional, nonparetic hand. Two samples of healthy control subjects (each N=25) using either their left or their right hand performed the test in identical way to obtain normative data for patients searching with their left hand (i.e. left hemisphere stroke patients) versus their right hand (i.e. right hemisphere stroke patients). The test can be performed within 5~minutes, even with aphasic or apractic stroke patients. Psychometric evaluations in a sample of 50 patients with unilateral stroke (25 leftsided, 25 rightsided) show high objectivity, high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.96), good retest-reliability (0.79 after 1 week in neglect patients) and good validity as compared with two other measures of BRN or multimodal neglect. Patient examples show that BRN as assessed with the vest test allows the detection of qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of BRN, and shows double dissociations from visual neglect and from apraxia in left hemisphere stroke patients. Details of the test including instructions and cut-off values are given for users in the appendix of this article. In conclusion, the vest test is a sensitive, quick and reliable test for BRN which complements the assessment of visuo- and audiospatial neglect and allows to measure recovery (spontaneous or treatment-induced) in patients with BRN. Furthermore, it can help to improve our knowledge about the multisensory coding of our body and the surrounding space in the human brain.",{},,Restorative neurology and neuroscience,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The articulatory disturbances were quite similar. One of the two cases was a left-handed male with a subcortical haemorrhage and the other a right-handed male with a cerebral infarct. The MRI and CT scans showed that the first case had a lesion that mainly involved the right precentral gyrus and its deep white matter, and that the second had a lesion mainly affecting the lower parts of the left precentral and postcentral gyri and their deep white matter. These findings and a literature review suggest that a corticosubcortical lesion of the lower part of the left precentral gyrus in most right handers and a lesion of the symmetric region in the right hemisphere in some left handers cause apraxia of speech. The omission errors for sounds articulated by the tongue and the hard palate were analysed using electropalatography, which records visually the dynamics of the palatolingual contact. The results demonstrated that there were three kinds of omission errors: true omissions (no palatolingual contact); omissions with incorrect contact (palatolingual contact for a different sound or undifferentiated sound); and omissions with correct contact (correct palatolingual contact for a target sound). The latter two types of omission error were observed for initial consonants and they were probably caused by a delay in air flow. The patients also showed a tendency to substitute one of the two consonants/t, t/for other sounds, which suggested that they had difficulty in the inhibition of tongue activity.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/110.5.1393,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The concomitant low grade fever suggestive of infection was unresponsive to cefazolin 1 g q12h, and refractory to piperacillin (PIPC) 2 g q8h. Blood culture grew enterococci, establishing together with echocardiography the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. The angiography revealed cerebral hemorrhage to have resulted from the rupture of the infected intracranial aneurysm. The antimicrobial therapy was switched to ampicillin (ABPC) 2 g q4h plus gentamicin (GM) 60 mg q8h. The positive blood culture was subsequently identified Enterococcus faecium to which the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PIPC, and ABPC was 16 mcg/mL, and 4 mcg/mL, respectively.

10395363,Impairment of depth perception in multiple sclerosis is improved by treatment with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with postural instability and an increased risk of falling which is facilitated by a variety of factors including diminished visual acuity, diplopia, ataxia, apraxia of gait, and peripheral neuropathy. Deficient binocular depth perception may also contribute to a higher incidence of postural instability and falling in these patients who, for example, find it an extremely difficult task to walk on uneven ground, over curbs, or up and down steps. I report a 51 year old woman with secondary progressive MS who experienced difficulties with binocular depth perception resulting in frequent falls and injuries. Deficient depth perception was demonstrated also on spontaneous drawing of a cube. Following a series of transcranial treatments with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7,5 picotesla flux density, the patient experienced a major improvement in depth perception which was evident particularly on ascending and descending stairs. These clinical changes were associated with an improvement in spatial organization and depth perception on drawing a cube. These findings suggest that in MS impairment of depth perception, which is encoded in the primary visual cortex (area 17) and visual association cortex (areas 18 and 19), may be improved by administration of AC pulsed EMFs of picotesla flux density. The primary visual cortex is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons which modulate visual information processing. Cerebral serotonin concentrations are diminished in MS patients and at least some aspects of deficient depth perception in MS may be related to dysfunction of serotonergic transmission in the primary visual cortex. It is suggested that transcranial AC pulsed applications of EMFs improve depth perception partly by augmenting serotonergic transmission in the visual cortex.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459908994794,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Buccofacial Apraxia frequently co-occurs with aphasia and apraxia of speech and it has been reported as almost exclusively resulting from a lesion of the left hemisphere. Recent studies have demonstrated the benefit of treating apraxia using motor training principles such as Augmented Feedback or Action Observation Therapy. In light of this, the study describes the treatment based on immersive Action Observation Therapy and Virtual Reality Augmented Feedback in a case of Buccofacial Apraxia. The participant is a right-handed 58-years-old male. He underwent a neurosurgery intervention of craniotomy and exeresis of infra axial expansive lesion in the frontoparietal convexity compatible with an atypical meningioma. Buccofacial Apraxia was diagnosed by a neurologist and evaluated by the Upper and Lower Face Apraxia Test. Buccofacial Apraxia was quantified also by a specific camera, with an appropriately developed software, able to detect the range of motion of automatic face movements and the range of the same movements on voluntary requests. In order to improve voluntary movements, the participant completed fifteen 1-hour rehabilitation sessions, composed of a 20-minutes immersive Action Observation Therapy followed by a 40-minutes Virtual Reality Augmented Feedback sessions, 5 days a week, for 3 consecutive weeks. After treatment, participant achieved great improvements in quality and range of facial movements, performing most of the facial expressions (eg, kiss, smile, lateral angle of mouth displacement) without unsolicited movement. Furthermore, the Upper and Lower Face Apraxia Test showed an improvement of 118% for the Upper Face movements and of 200% for the Lower Face movements.

CT and MRI revealed bilateral post-ischaemic lesions in the dorsomedial thalamus and the mesodiencephalic junction, dorsomedial to the red nucleus, thus being restricted to the territory of the posterior thalamosubthalamic paramedian artery, which includes the region of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle as the main premotor nucleus for the generation of vertical saccades. In our patients, oculographic examination with electro-oculography and magnetic search coil recording showed severe impairment of downward more than upward saccades and only minor deficits of vertical pursuit and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Visual functions were normal, with one exception: a psychophysical test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical movements. This could be due to a central adaptive mechanism which, in order to minimize oscillopsia, might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze palsy. As an alternative explanation, lesions within the midbrain tegmentum could have damaged subcortical visual pathways involved in motion perception.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00314736,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Computed tomography revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the interhemispheric fissure, bilateral sylvian fissures, and basal cistern, and a hematoma in the supracallosal region. Angiography showed a large aneurysm (23 x 18 mm) located on the distal end of the azygos anterior cerebral artery (azygos ACA) at the supracallosal portion. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the hematoma as a mixed intensity mass, compressing the corpus callosum downward, and the aneurysm as a flow void anterior to the hematoma. Unilateral frontoparietal parasagittal craniotomy was performed with a horse-shoe shaped incision. The aneurysm was clipped via the interhemispheric approach, and the hematoma was aspirated. Postoperative angiography showed disappearance of the aneurysm and intact azygos ACA. The patient was discharged with mild monoparesis, paresthesia of the left lower limb and diagnostic dyspraxia. DACAA almost always arises at or near the genu of the corpus callosum and is often associated with vascular anomaly. In the literature, 22 of 26 cases of large and giant DACAA were located at or near the genu, but only 3 cases, including ours, in the supracallosal area. 11 cases were associated with azygos ACA. Therefore, hemodynamic stress caused by vascular anomaly may be involved in the formation of large or giant DACAA in contrast with cases of normal DACAA.",{},,No shinkei geka.

Thus, there is a need to reappraise the broad spectrum of SLDs in PSP to include other presenting phenotypes. Here we report findings from the study of two elderly patients with PSP presenting with DA and irrepressible echolalia. Both patients had markedly impoverished verbal production, but their performance in other tasks (repetition and naming) and auditory comprehension were preserved or only mildly impaired. Experimental tests of DA revealed impaired word and sentence generation in response to verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Additional language and cognitive testing revealed different types of echolalia (mitigated, automatic, and echoing approval) as well as impaired inhibitory control and social cognition (mentalizing). Both patients had negative neuropsychiatric alterations (i.e., apathy, aspontaneity, and indifference/emotional flatness). Brain magnetic resonance imaging in both patients showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and superior medial frontal cortex suggestive of PSP, yet further evaluation of the neural correlates using multimodal neuroimaging and neuropathological data was not performed. However, based on the already known neural basis of DA and echolalia in PSP and stroke, we suggest that, in the present cases, neurodegeneration in the midbrain tegmentum, superior medial frontal lobe, and caudate nucleus was responsible for DA and that decreased activity in these regions may play a permissive role for eliciting verbal echoing <i>via</i> disinhibition of the perisylvian speech-language network.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,10.3389/fnagi.2021.635896,PMC8129544,dynamic aphasia; echolalia; inhibition deficits; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere.
