29859732,"Anton-Babinski syndrome, case report.","Martín Juan, A; Madrigal, R; Porta Etessam, J; Sáenz-Francés San Baldomero, F; Santos Bueso, E",Martín Juan,"A 22 year-old woman complained about blurred vision after an episode of recovered cardiorespiratory arrest. She had bilateral low visual acuity («count fingers») and no ophthalmological or visual pathways changes. She also had an apparent lack of awareness of the deficit. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed ischaemic changes in both occipital lobes. As a result, she was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. This is a rare disease that should be suspected in strange or poorly congruent visual loss. It is usually due to an ischaemic injury in this region of brain, manifesting itself with low vision not perceived by the patient (visual confabulation). It can simulate a non-organic visual loss or psychiatric disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Archivos de la Sociedad Espanola de Oftalmologia,10.1016/j.oftal.2018.04.004,,Agudeza visual; Blindness; Ceguera; Neurology; Neurología; Oftalmología; Ophthalmology; Visual acuity,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng; spa
38586806,Anton-Babinski Syndrome: A Visual Anosognosia.,"Ziaul, Yasir H; Mittal, Jimmy; Afroze, Tazeen; Kumar, Vivek",Ziaul,"Anton-Babinski syndrome is a rare extension of cortical blindness following injury to the occipital lobe. The patient behaves as sighted but has visual function derangements. The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke represents 5% to 10% of total strokes. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a rise in stroke cases. We present a case of this rare PCA stroke, first diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. This case had an inconsistent initial presentation, but subsequent computed tomography of the brain and other neurological investigations confirmed the diagnosis. If such cases are diagnosed early, they could have better management. Timely intervention can decrease morbidity as well as mortality.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.55679,PMC10997746,anton-babinski syndrome; cortical blindness; posterior cerebral artery; stroke; visual anosognosia,Case Reports,United States,eng
34567463,Bilateral occipital lobe infarct neglect deficit (BLIND) syndrome.,"Shanmugam, S; Haver, H L; Knecht, S M; Rajjoub, R; Ali, O; Chow, R",Shanmugam,"Cortical blindness is characterized by loss of vision due to dysfunction of the visual cortices, most commonly secondary to bilateral ischemic infarcts of the occipital lobe. Other causes include surgery such as aortic valve replacement, laryngeal surgery, craniotomy, cerebral angiography, head trauma, and partial seizures. Visual anosognosia is a distinct feature of cortical blindness, wherein patients claim they can see and confabulate visual perceptions, despite loss of sight. We herewith present a rare phenomenon known as Anton Syndrome, an eponym named after the Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist, Gabriel Anton (1858-1933). There are a limited number of cases of Anton's Syndrome in the literature, with only 28 case reports published from 1965-2016. Although he was bestowed a neurologic eponym, Anton was an advocate of eugenics and racial hygiene. He publicly advocated for 'superior breeding' and 'selection' in order to 'build a brave and noble race.' We therefore propose replacing the eponym with Bilateral Occipital Lobe Infarct Neglect Deficit (BLIND) Syndrome, with intention of raising awareness of this unique presentation as well as of the widespread interest in eugenics in the early 1900s amongst physicians, notably Gabriel Anton.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,10.1080/20009666.2021.1974730,PMC8462920,Anton syndrome; atrial tachyarrhythmia; blind syndrome; cortical blindness; visual anosognosia,Case Reports,United States,eng
25515048,Anton-Babinski syndrome in an old patient: a case report and literature review.,"Chen, Jiann-Jy; Chang, Hsin-Feng; Hsu, Yung-Chu; Chen, Dem-Lion",Chen,"Anton-Babinski syndrome is a rare disease featuring bilateral cortical blindness and anosognosia with visual confabulation, but without dementia or any memory impairment. It has a unique neuropsychiatric presentation and should be highly suspected in those with odd visual loss and imaging evidence of occipital lobe injury. In the case discussed herein, a 90-year-old man presented with bilateral blindness, obvious anosognosia, and vivid visual confabulation, which he had had for 3 days. Brain computed tomography demonstrated recent hypodense infarctions at the bilateral occipital lobes. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. Because of his age and the thrombolytic therapy during the golden 3 hours after ischemic stroke, the patient received aspirin therapy rather than tissue plasminogen activator or warfarin. He gradually realized he was blind during the following week, but died of pneumonia 1 month later. In the literature, it is difficult to establish awareness of blindness in patients with Anton-Babinski syndrome, but optimistically, in one report, a patient was aware of blindness within 2 weeks, without vision improvement. Our case illustrates that elderly patients with Anton-Babinski syndrome can partially recover and that 1 week is the shortest time for the establishment of awareness of blindness for sufferers without vision improvement.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Psychogeriatrics : the official journal of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society,10.1111/psyg.12064,,Anton-Babinski syndrome; blind anosognosia; cortical blindness; occipital lobe infarction; visual confabulation,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng
37860783,Anton syndrome with bilateral occipital infarct: A case report.,"Mankoo, Dylan",Mankoo,"Anton syndrome results from damage to the visual cortex of the occipital lobes, where the anterior visual pathways remain intact. This damage results in the characteristic triad of cortical blindness, visual anosognosia, and visual confabulation. This case describes an 80-year-old male with a background of renal transplant 7 years prior, admitted to hospital with worsening transplant function, and soon after developed sudden onset cortical blindness. On examination, the patient was found to be in denial of his blindness and showed signs of visual confabulation, both of which pointed toward a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. Radiological investigation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral ischemic stroke of the occipital lobes, which was later theorized to have occurred due to sirolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of sirolimus-induced TMA, bilateral ischemic occipital lobe stroke, and Anton's syndrome, within the same diagnosis. This case highlights that a diagnosis of bilateral occipital stroke with denial of blindness should suggest a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. This report also discusses the importance of differentiating bilateral occipital infarction on CT imaging, from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), using MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.09.036,PMC10582287,Anton syndrome; Neuroradiology; Stroke,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

The brain imaging studies showed a bilateral occipital ischemic lesion, as well as frontal and parietal hemorrhagic lesions in the right hemisphere. We address the general theories of anosognosia, confabulation and the problem of why a bilateral occipital lesion is not enough for these metacognitive defects to exist.

First case is that of a 73-year-old woman, who presented with two separate events of intraparenchymal brain haemorrhage, 4 years apart. Her first stroke affected the left and second affected the right occipital lobe. Bilateral occipital lobe damage resulted in cortical blindness. Second case is an 88-year-old man, who suffered from two ischaemic strokes, 2 days apart. Each stroke involved one posterior cerebral artery. This resulted in bilateral occipital and temporal lobe infarcts. Third case is a 64-year-old woman with chronic renal failure, who suffered bilateral occipital lobe infarction after haemodialysis, due to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

Neuroinvasive WNV cases continue to be rare and have a higher prevalence in South America, Africa, and Asia. Here we report a 55-year-old female from North America who presented with acute-onset encephalopathy, fever, myalgias, and Anton syndrome. Neuroradiographic findings included diffuse white matter abnormalities of both cortical and subcortical structures and the patient was diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Further workup revealed WNV antibodies in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Management of WNV encephalitis continues to be poor and thus the patient was referred to a long-term care facility. Furthermore, Anton syndrome is a rare focal neurologic deficit that has never been previously associated with the WNV. This case aims to highlight the epidemiology of WNV in the United States, the mechanisms of WNV encephalitis, and an overview of Anton syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.26264,PMC9312882,anton's syndrome; anton–babinski syndrome; flavivirus; infectious disease; internal medicine; leukoencephalopathy; neuroinfectious disease; neuroinvasive west nile virus; neurology; west nile virus,Case Reports,United States,eng

The patient was brought to the emergency room following a sudden loss of vision in the context of a pre-existing left-sided hemianopia after excision of a right occipital astrocytoma followed by radio-chemotherapy 35 years prior to his admission in our services. At admittance, he also presented hyperthermia, hypertension, and a GCS of 7. The MRI showed a leptomeningeal enhancement in the left temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. After exclusion of other differential diagnoses, we diagnosed a cortical blindness in the context of a SMART syndrome affecting the left hemisphere. While the symptoms improved under corticosteroid therapy, the patient successively presented an Anton-Babinski syndrome, a Riddoch syndrome and a visual associative agnosia before finally regaining his usual sight. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of an Anton-Babinski syndrome in the context of a SMART syndrome. A dual etiology is mandatory for cortical blindness in SMART syndrome since the latter affects only one hemisphere. A SMART syndrome affecting the contralateral hemisphere in respect to the radiation site seems to be uncommon, which makes this case even more exceptional.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2022.887287,PMC9271741,Anton-Babinski syndrome; Riddoch syndrome; SMART syndrome; cortical blindness; dual etiology; visual associative agnosia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Her pretended visual experiences could frequently be traced back to synaesthetic translations of acoustic or tactile perceptions into mental visual images. Possibly, the belief to see resulted from a confusion of mental visual images with real percepts. The patient manifested preserved visual imagery also by correct responses to questions concerning the shapes of letters and the shapes and colours of objects. MRI showed an almost complete destruction of primary visual cortex with sparing of only small remainders of cortex at the occipital tip of the left upper calcarine lip. In the literature there are a few cases of denial of blindness with similarly severe damage to primary visual cortex but none with unequivocal evidence of complete destruction of primary visual cortex. We conclude that severe damage to primary visual cortex is compatible with visual imagery but that there is a possibility that islands of visual cortex must be spared to permit the generation of mental visual images.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(95)00070-j,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Bifrontal brain injury, bilateral enucleation, affective indifference (anosodiaphoria), generalized anosognosia, and the conviction that vision will resume mark clear clinical differences with Anton syndrome. Differentiating these findings from Anton syndrome will help occupational therapists, neuropsychologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, and physicians when assessing frontal lobe brain injury with total and partial visual loss.
