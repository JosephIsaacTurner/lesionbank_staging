943070,Reduplicative paramnesia.,"Benson, D F; Gardner, H; Meadows, J C",Benson,"A striking behavioral abnormality is described in three individuals who had severe head trauma. At a point when general mnestic capabilities had returned to a near normal level, the patients persistently relocated the hospital at another geographical site, even in the face of compelling counter-evidence. The strong parallels in the etiology and course of the three cases justify the positing of a syndrome, here termed reduplicative paramnesia. A neuropsychologic analysis of the disorder stresses the cognitive operations entailed in geographical localization and confabulation. Clinical-pathologic considerations underline the role of right hemisphere and frontal lobe structures in the syndrome.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.26.2.147,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng
21467922,Reduplicative paramnesia after a right frontal lesion.,"Lee, Koomi; Shinbo, Michiko; Kanai, Hinako; Nagumo, Yumi",Lee,"To report a case of reduplicative paramnesia after a focal lesion localized in the right frontal subcortical region. It is suggested that a right frontal subcortical lesion alone may be sufficient to cause cognitive disturbance that can develop into reduplicative paramnesia. Clinical data have been scarce. We describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroradiologic findings of a 69-year-old man with reduplicative paramnesia after a right frontal subcortical lesion. Observation and neuropsychological study showed visuospatial impairment, visual-dominant memory disturbance, anosognosia for cognitive disturbance, and mild frontal dysfunction with paranoid personality. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging study showed a lesion localized in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area, and we could define 5 neural pathways involved with the lesion. We supposed that 4 of these were potentially related to reduplicative paramnesia: the medial inferior component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, which are related to visuospatial processing; the anterior thalamic radiation, which is concerned with memory processes; and the uncinate fasciculus, which may be related to abnormal feelings of hyperfamiliarity. A localized lesion in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area can cause cognitive dysfunction that may develop into reduplicative paramnesia. Paranoid personality and the change of the patient's hospital room might have triggered the reduplicative delusion in this case.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31821129b7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
10230995,Reduplicative paramnesia: longitudinal neurobehavioral and neuroimaging analysis.,"Moser, D J; Cohen, R A; Malloy, P F; Stone, W M; Rogg, J M",Moser,"Reduplicative paramnesia (RP) is a delusion in which the patient perceives familiar places, objects, or events to have been duplicated. The current case describes the development of RP in an 81-year-old male following a large right frontal lobe infarction. As the patient had been hospitalized previously with hemorrhagic contusions, neurologic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data were obtained both prior to and following RP onset. Psychophysiologic data were obtained following the development of the delusion. Both premorbidly and at follow-up, neuropsychological functioning was characterized by significant impairments of learning and memory and frontal-executive functions. Language and visuospatial skills and motor speed were intact both before and after RP onset. The case is described within the context of preexisting theories of RP, and it is surmised that the delusion is secondary to temporal-limbic-frontal dysfunction giving rise to a distorted sense of familiarity and impaired ability to resolve the delusion via reasoning.",{},,Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,10.1177/089198879901100402,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
2579971,Neuropsychological analysis of a case of reduplicative paramnesia.,"Patterson, M B; Mack, J L",Patterson,"Following a right cerebral hemispheric CVA, a patient showed extensive reduplication of place (his hospital) and occasional reduplication of person. His language was essentially intact, but he was deficient on tests of conceptualization and on nonverbal tasks, both visual and auditory. Short- and long-term memory for nonverbal but not verbal material were also impaired. However, he had sufficient ""memory"" for the reduplicated hospitals to comment that they were spatially identical. He simply seemed unable to treat these memories as representing the same phenomena. Neuropsychological analysis suggest that reduplicative paramnesia represents a combination of perceptual and memory deficits as well as impaired ability to integrate information.",{},,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/01688638508401245,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
7187632,Reduplicative paramnesia: a disconnection syndrome of memory.,"Staton, R D; Brumback, R A; Wilson, H",Staton,"A case of post-traumatic reduplicative paramnesia (Capgras syndrome) is presented in which the patient experiences duplications in all three spheres of orientation (time, place, person). We postulate that these duplications are the result of a disconnection of new memory registration from past memory stores. The patient is unable to integrate present cues with premorbid experience, and bases judgments of his present orientation upon recollections from the past. A deep lesion at the right posterior hippocampus and temporo-parieto-occipital junction is suggested as the site of this postulated primary memory disconnection, based upon neuropsychological testing and CAT scan results. This right temporal atrophy and memory disconnection appears to have induced immature personality changes.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(82)80016-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Italy,eng
571979,Capgras syndrome: a reduplicative phenomenon.,"Alexander, M P; Stuss, D T; Benson, D F",Alexander,"A patient recovering from a severe head injury developed a prolonged Capgras syndrome in which he believed his wife and five children had been replaced by nearly identical substitutes. Although this phenomenon is considered a functional disorder in the psychiatric literature, recent reports postulate an organic basis. Recent studies of the comparable neurologic disorder, reduplicative paramnesia, have stressed the importance of bilateral frontal and right hemisphere pathology. Neuropsychologic and neuroradiologic data in our patient revealed this combination, suggesting that the Capgras syndrome may be a form of reduplicative paramnesia with the same pathologic substrate.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.29.3.334,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neuropsychological examination revealed significant memory impairment, perservation on a problem solving task and marked left-sided inattention. Recovery from the paramnesic episode was accompanied by selective resolution of the original cognitive deficits. It is suggested that focal right frontal pathology may represent a sufficient condition for the occurrence of reduplicative paramnesia, and that the underlying mechanisms may be dependent on a particular combination and severity of memory, visuospatial and conceptual deficits.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.51.4.579,PMC1032979,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

3156653,"Organic delusions: phenomenology, anatomical correlations, and review.","Cummings, J L",Cummings,"Organic delusions are common, but have received little systematic study. Review of the literature reveals that they occur most commonly in toxic-metabolic processes and in disorders affecting the limbic system and basal ganglia. A prospective study of 20 consecutive patients with organic delusions revealed four general types of false beliefs: simple persecutory delusions, complex persecutory delusions, grandiose delusions, and those associated with specific neurological defects (anosognosia, reduplicative paramnesia). Simple delusions responded best to treatment, and complex delusions were more resistent. Acting on delusional beliefs was not unusual, and treatment of the delusions was an important aspect of management of the patient.",{},,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,10.1192/bjp.146.2.184,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",England,eng

10500870,Bilateral anterior cortical atrophy and subcortical atrophy in reduplicative paramnesia: a case-control study of computed tomography in 10 patients.,"Joseph, A B; O'Leary, D H; Kurland, R; Ellis, H D",Joseph,"Reduplicative paramnesia (RP) is thought to be related to other delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) such as Capgras syndrome. DMS are thought to occur when brain lesions disrupt cortical functioning. This study tests this hypothesis and tries to understand whether focal lesions are as important in the etiology of RP as they are in other types of DMS. The computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 consecutive psychiatric inpatients with RP and another principal psychiatric diagnosis were compared with those of control patients without RP matched for age, sex, and principal psychiatric diagnosis. The scans were assessed blindly by a neuroradiologist using a previously published rating scale for the presence of lesions in 11 discrete anatomic areas. The differences between the 2 groups were examined statistically using log-linear analysis. Statistical analysis revealed that index patient cortical atrophy, cortical fissure enlargement, and deep brain atrophy distinguished the 2 groups significantly (P < 0.05). Bilateral anterior cortical, brain stem, and cerebellar vermis atrophy and dysfunction may be important in the pathogenesis of RP in particular and of DMS in general.",{},,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

11032619,Misidentification syndromes related to face specific area in the fusiform gyrus.,"Hudson, A J; Grace, G M",Hudson,"The ""delusional misidentification syndromes"" are a group of uncommon and varied disorders in which, in typical form, the patient thinks that a particular familiar person is someone else or a certain familiar place is a duplicate. Although first identified and considered a memory disorder by Pick, evidence in support of this has been difficult to identify. They have been most often seen in various psychotic and organic brain diseases but lesions have been generally diffuse although the right temporal lobe has been implicated. A patient was investigated who abruptly developed a disorder wherein she misidentified her husband as her deceased sister and claimed that her home was a duplicate of her real home that were typical of Frégoli syndrome and Pick's reduplicative paramnesia, respectively. A discrete area of brain damage, probably ischaemic, in this patient was seen on MRI in the anterior part of the right fusiform gyrus and a smaller area in the nearby anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri with associated parahippocampal and hippocampal atrophy. A high order nervous system function that is devoted to the identification of faces is located in the adjacent midportion of the fusiform gyrus and a similar locus for environmental scenes, termed the parahippocampal place area, is present in the bordering parahippocampal gyrus. The misidentification phenomena in this case can be explained by disruption of the connections of these highly specialised areas with the most anterior inferior and medial part of the right temporal lobe where long term memory and mechanisms for the retrieval of information that are required for the visual recognition of faces and scenes are stored.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.69.5.645,PMC1763428,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
15512841,Hypersexuality and dysexecutive syndrome after a thalamic infarct.,"Spinella, Marcello",Spinella,"Hypersexuality can result from insults to several neuroanatomical structures that regulate sexual behavior. A case is presented of an adult male with a thalamic infarct resulting in a paramedian thalamic syndrome, consisting of hypersomnolence, confabulatory anterograde amnesia (including reduplicative paramnesia), vertical gaze deficits, and hypophonic speech. A dysexecutive syndrome also manifested, consisting of social disinhibition, apathy, witzelsucht, motor inhibition deficits, and environmental dependence. Hypersexuality uncharacteristic of his premorbid behavior was evident in instances of exhibitionism, public masturbation, and verbal sexual obscenities. In contrast to the few previous reports of hypersexuality following thalamic infarct, this case neither involved mania nor hemichorea. The relevance of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in limbic and prefrontal circuits is discussed.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.1080/00207450490509339,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
20724253,[Reduplication of an event after right caudate nucleus haemorrhage].,"Pluchon, C; Salmon, F; Houeto, J L; Listrat, A; Vandermarcq, P; Gil, R",Pluchon,"Environmental reduplication which is characterized by reduplication of places has been reported in right hemispheric lesions, particularly but not only in the right frontal region. However, spatial delirium may follow right sub-cortical lesions. We describe a 53 years-old man who had a reduplicative paramnesia for event alone after an intracerebral haematoma of the right caudate nucleus. MRI Scan showed also an extension of the right caudate nucleus haemorrhage into the ventricular system. Regional cerebral blood flow studied with 99Tcm-HMPAO showed a decrease of perfusion in the right dorso-lateral frontal cortex. To our knowledge, we reported the first case of reduplicative paramnesia of event associated with a right caudate nucleus injury. Similar right frontal deactivation was observed in two cases of reduplicative paramnesia for place, one of them after an infarction of the retro-lenticular portion of the right internal capsulae, the other after a right thalamo-capsular haemorrhage. We suggest that reduplicative paramnesia for event, like the previous cases reported of reduplicative paramnesia for place, may be linked to a subcortical lesion of the frontal lobe inducing a right functional frontal deactivation.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

CSD has been reported in focal and diffuse cerebral disorders. A focal lesion such as frontal lobes and the right hemispheric lesion have been documented The authors describe a 66 year-old woman who had a delusion of misidentification for place one month after right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The patient did not have any history of schizophrenia or other psychiatric diseases. The patient believed that her car, furniture and house were duplicated. She also mentioned that her son and friends tried to takeover all of her properties and told everyone that she was insane. The prominent cortical signs were tactile and visual neglect. Neuropsychological assessments revealed poor attention but she had neither confusion nor dementia. Clock drawing and construction tests revealed visuospatial impairment which was compatible with non-dominant hemispheric abnormality. MRI showed evidence of cerebral infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Only one similar patient who had an intracerbral hematoma of the right frontal lobe has been reported in the literature.
