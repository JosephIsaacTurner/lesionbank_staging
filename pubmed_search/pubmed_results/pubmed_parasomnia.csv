23385699,Sleep and comorbid neurologic disorders.,"Watson, Nathaniel F; Viola-Saltzman, Mari",Watson,"An understanding of the impact of sleep on neurologic disorders, and the impact of neurologic disorders on sleep, provides fresh opportunities for neurologists to improve the quality of life and functioning of their patients. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and should be considered in all TIA and stroke patients. Sleep disorders can amplify nociception and worsen headache disorders; and some headaches, including those related to SDB and hypnic headache, are sleep specific. REM sleep behavior disorder may be an early sign of neurodegenerative disease. Focal lesions of almost any etiology (eg, multiple sclerosis and CNS malignancies) in the hypothalamus, basal forebrain, or brainstem may result in sleep disturbance, sleepiness, and insomnia. Sleep-related hypoventilation and fatigue are common in neuromuscular disease. SDB and epilepsy are mutually facilitatory, and poor sleep can exacerbate epilepsy. Continued surveillance for sleep disorders by neurologists is rewarded by new treatment avenues in their patients with the possibility of improved clinical outcomes.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/01.CON.0000427208.13553.8c,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

This had followed an initial episode of transient drowsiness which lasted 24 hours. On examination, there was some evidence of visual memory and frontal lobe deficits. A brain CT scan showed bilateral thalamic infarcts and a brain SPECT scan showed bilateral hypoperfusion of the frontal lobes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of thalamic infarction associated with acute-onset cyclical affective psychosis with clinical and neurophysiological features of frontal lobe syndrome. The case also highlights the possible role of thalamo-frontal circuits in the pathogenesis of the Kleine-Levin syndrome.",{},,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,10.1192/bjp.163.1.113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

34861213,Fatal Wernicke's Encephalopathy with Cardiovascular Involvement in a Young Psychiatric Patient.,"Ahmad, Soban; Ikram, Sundus; Dunn, Bryan K",Ahmad,"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency that is frequently missed in non-alcoholic patients. Coma and cardiomyopathy are uncommon presentations of WE that have been rarely reported in the literature. We report the case of a 36-year-old male with a known history of schizophrenia who presented with coma and vasopressor refractory hypotension. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head at admission was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed diffuse myocardial hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-45%. Due to persistent encephalopathy, a repeat non-enhanced CT head was obtained on the second day of hospital admission followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain that showed findings suggestive of WE. The patient was immediately started on high-dose intravenous (IV) thiamine therapy. Although his hemodynamic parameters significantly improved following thiamine replacement, he did not show signs of neurological recovery and resulted in a dismal outcome. This case illustrates the importance of early recognition of thiamine deficiency in critically ill patients to prevent fatal outcomes. Immediate parenteral thiamine administration should be considered in all patients presenting with coma, cardiomyopathy, and refractory hypotension regardless of their body mass index, and alcohol use status.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of the medical sciences,10.1016/j.amjms.2021.10.015,,Cardiomyopathy; Coma; Schizophrenia; Wernicke's encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

However, the clinical features of anti-IgLON5 disease resembling MSA have not been well established. We enrolled 35 patients with suspected MSA for whom anti-IgLON5 antibody tests were requested. We evaluated immunoglobulin G (IgG) against IgLON5 using cell-based assays. We also summarized the clinical characteristics of patients who were positive for anti-IgLON5 antibodies. We identified serum and cerebrospinal fluid anti-IgLON5 antibodies in three patients. These patients had many clinical features characteristic of MSA, including parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, severe orthostatic hypotension, acute respiratory failure, sleep parasomnia, vocal cord paralysis, and pyramidal tract signs. Clinical features atypical for MSA were myorhythmia, horizontal eye movement restriction, fasciculations, and painful muscle cramps. Anti-IgLON5 disease may be an important differential diagnosis of MSA.

33380716,Isolated Pulvinar/Hockey Stick Sign in Nonalcoholic Wernicke's Encephalopathy.,"Khan, Faisal; Sharma, Neha; Ud Din, Moin; Bansal, Vivek",Khan,"BACKGROUND Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), a commonly misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed pathology, presents with altered mental status, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. WE is most commonly caused by excessive alcohol use, but also has diverse nonalcoholic etiologies. Here we describe 2 cases of nonalcoholic WE with different etiologies that were initially misdiagnosed due to lack of correlation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with clinical information. CASE REPORT Patient A, a 50-year-old woman with recent gastric sleeve surgery, presented with horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, ataxia, and altered mental status. MRI fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) revealed isolated bilateral, symmetrical, thalamic hyperintensities, initially diagnosed as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A review of imaging and clinical presentation provided an alternate diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE secondary to nutritional deficiency. Intravenous (IV) thiamine improved symptoms with resolution of MRI findings 6 months later. Patient B, a 64-year-old woman, presented with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, altered mental status, and weight loss. MRI FLAIR revealed isolated bilateral, symmetrical, thalamic hyperintensities, initially determined to be ischemia, prompting stroke management. A diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE was suggested, given the patient's low thiamine levels and history of malnutrition, and was confirmed by her excellent therapeutic response to IV thiamine. CONCLUSIONS Nonalcoholic WE remains a challenging diagnosis because of the variable clinical presentation, myriad of underlying etiologies, and lack of standardized diagnostic laboratory tests. A multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration between the radiologist and clinical care team is critical to narrow down the differential and initiate correct management. WE is a reversible disease with catastrophic consequences if it is not recognized and treated promptly.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.928272,PMC7784713,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

In anti-Ma2 encephalitis, hypersomnia appears to be frequent. However, only few cases of type 1 narcolepsy have been reported to date with anti-Ma2 encephalitis. We report 2 new cases of patients with narcolepsy secondary to anti-Ma2 encephalitis. Patient 1, a 68-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 1, including sleep attacks, cataplexy, abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests and hypocretin-1 deficiency (< 50 ng/L) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), associated with a cerebellar syndrome. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF and antivoltage-gated potassium channel antibodies in the serum. He benefited from a treatment with pitolisant. Patient 2, a 42-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 2, including hypersomnolence, no cataplexy, intermediate CSF levels of hypocretin-1 (138 ng/L), abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, and a limbic encephalitis presentation. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF, and anti-Ma1 antibodies were in the CSF.

33652467,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Subsequent to Apparent Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Rieke, Jake D; Lamb, Damon G; Lewis, Gregory F; Davila, Maria I; Schmalfuss, Ilona M; Murphy, Aidan J; Tran, Amy B; Bottari, Sarah A; Williamson, John B",Rieke,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the relationship between TBI and PTSD is not well understood. We present the case of a 31-year-old male veteran with PTSD who reported TBI before entering the military. The reported injury appeared to be mild: He was struck on the head by a baseball, losing consciousness for ∼10 seconds. Years later, he developed severe PTSD after combat exposure. He was not receiving clinical services for these issues but was encountered in the context of a research study. We conducted cognitive, autonomic, and MRI assessments to assess brain function, structure, and neurophysiology. Next, we compared amygdala volume, uncinate fasciculus diffusion, functional connectivity, facial affect recognition, and baroreceptor coherence with those of a control group of combat veterans (n = 23). Our veteran's MRI revealed a large right medial-orbital prefrontal lesion with surrounding atrophy, which the study neuroradiologist interpreted as likely caused by traumatic injury. Comparison with controls indicated disrupted structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal-limbic structures and impaired emotional, cognitive, and autonomic responses. Detection of this injury before combat would have been unlikely in a clinical context because our veteran had reported a phenomenologically mild injury, and PTSD is a simple explanation for substance abuse, sleep impairment, and psychosocial distress. However, it may be that right prefrontal-limbic disruption imparted vulnerability for the development of PTSD and exacerbated our veteran's emotional response to, and recovery from, PTSD.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000264,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This article reviews Lhermitte sign, Pulfrich phenomenon, Uhthoff phenomenon, and the useless hand of Oppenheim, along with the underrecognized phenomena of transient neurologic events (including tonic spasms). Disorders of temperature regulation in MS (likely based on hypothalamic involvement) which can present with bizarre behavioral change and evade diagnosis, are also discussed. The article concludes with a review of epilepsy and sleep disorders in MS, both of which appear to occur at an increased frequency in the MS population and may have implications for therapy.

3898769,The social environment and neurological disease.,"Grant, I",Grant,"This chapter has reviewed some of the methodological and theoretical issues in research linking the social environment to medical illnesses. The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.",{},,Advances in psychosomatic medicine,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",Switzerland,eng

Although he had no neurologic deficits, perfusion computed tomography (CT) scan showed a slight decrease in blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere, which was presumed to have been caused by the scalp arteriovenous malformation. He suffered from a sleep disorder caused by tinnitus, and a discomfort with the lesion itself; therefore, we decided to surgically remove the lesion. To suppress intraoperative bleeding and safely perform the surgery, preoperative embolization was also planned. After treatment, he had no neurologic deficits and the sleep disorder improved. Perfusion CT scan performed after the surgery showed an improvement in cerebral blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere. Because cerebral blood flow may decrease depending on the progression of the lesion, the cerebral blood flow should be evaluated.

To date, very few cases have been reported in association football players. To describe the clinicopathological features of a case of CTE in an 84-year-old former football player who was clinically diagnosed as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A retrospective review of the patient's primary care and hospital medical records was performed along with a comprehensive neuropathological examination. This patient presented at age 84 with symmetrical parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that was exacerbated by prochlorperazine. His condition was rapidly progressive with recurrent falls within 1 year. Other features included headaches, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, disturbed sleep and aggression. He received a clinical diagnosis of DLB and died approximately 2 years after the onset of symptoms. A post-mortem examination revealed stage 4 CTE. While the contemporaneous onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms in the context of possible neuroleptic sensitivity is suggestive of DLB, the additional symptoms of aggressive behavior, depression and suicidality in a former football player are consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE. This case, which is notable for the late presentation, demonstrates that CTE may masquerade as other dementias and highlights the importance of seeking a history of repetitive head impacts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Movement disorders clinical practice,10.1002/mdc3.13829,PMC10525051,chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia with Lewy bodies; football; pathology; soccer,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng
24332366,A neurologist's approach to delirium: diagnosis and management of toxic metabolic encephalopathies.,"Krishnan, Vaishnav; Leung, Lester Y; Caplan, Louis R",Krishnan,"Toxic metabolic encephalopathies (TMEs) present as an acute derangement in consciousness, cognition and behavior, and can be brought about by various triggers, including endocrine and metabolic disturbances, exogenous toxins, pain and infection. Also referred to as ""delirium"" or ""acute confusional states,"" TMEs are characterized by (1) an altered level of consciousness and activity, (2) global changes in cognition with inattention, (3) a fluctuating course with disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, and (4) asterixis and myoclonus. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is poorly understood. Imbalanced neurotransmitter signaling and pathologically heightened brain inflammatory cytokine signaling have been proposed as candidate mechanisms. Focal brain lesions can also occasionally mimic TMEs. A neurological examination is required to identify the presence of focal findings, which when present, identify a new focal lesion or the recrudescence of prior ischemic, inflammatory or neoplastic insults. Diagnostic testing must include a search for metabolic and infectious derangements. Offending medications should be withdrawn. Magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroencephalography should be considered in select clinical situations. In addition to being an unpleasant experience for the patient and family, this condition is associated with extended hospital stays, increased mortality and high costs. In individuals with diminished cognitive reserve, episodes of TME lead to an accelerated decline in cognitive functioning. Starting with an illustrative case, this paper provides a neurologist's approach to the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and management of toxic metabolic encephalopathies.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,European journal of internal medicine,10.1016/j.ejim.2013.11.010,,Confusion; Confusional state; Delirium; Encephalopathy; Metabolic encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng
26444476,Neurotherapy of Traumatic Brain Injury/Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Vietnam Veterans.,"Nelson, David V; Esty, Mary Lee",Nelson,"Previous report suggested the beneficial effects of an adaptation of the Flexyx Neurotherapy System (FNS) for the amelioration of mixed traumatic brain injury/post-traumatic stress symptoms in veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. As a novel variant of electroencephalograph biofeedback, FNS falls within the bioenergy domain of complementary and alternative medicine. Rather than learning voluntary control over the production/inhibition of brain wave patterns, FNS involves offsetting stimulation of brain wave activity by means of an external energy source, specifically, the conduction of electromagnetic energy stimulation via the connecting electroencephalograph cables. Essentially, these procedures subliminally induce strategic distortion of ongoing brain wave activity to presumably facilitate resetting of more adaptive patterns of activity. Reported herein are two cases of Vietnam veterans with mixed traumatic brain injury/post-traumatic stress symptoms, each treated with FNS for 25 sessions. Comparisons of pre- and post-treatment questionnaire assessments revealed notable decreases for all symptoms, suggesting improvements across the broad domains of cognition, pain, sleep, fatigue, and mood/emotion, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as for overall activity levels. Findings suggest FNS treatment may be of potential benefit for the partial amelioration of symptoms, even in some individuals for whom symptoms have been present for decades.",{},,Military medicine,10.7205/MILMED-D-14-00696,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, stroke involving the hypothalamus has rarely been described. Here, we report a patient with infarction restricted to the hypothalamus who presented with sudden onset of sleep. A 42-year-old woman with a history of migraine without aura presented with irresistible sleepiness and developed several episodes of sudden onset of sleep. Neurological examinations were unremarkable except for partial left Horner syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high-intensity lesion restricted to the left hypothalamus on diffusion-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI images. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin-A levels obtained on hospital day 3 after her sleepiness had resolved were normal (337 pg/mL; normal > 200 pg/mL).

A small hypothalamic infarction was suspected, and the patient was treated with intravenous edaravone and argatroban, as well as oral clopidogrel. Three months later, there had been no clinical relapse, and the hypothalamic lesion had almost disappeared on follow-up MRI. No new lesion suggestive of demyelinating disease or tumor was observed.

It is defined by subacute encephalopathy, neuromuscular hyperexcitability, dysautonomia, and sleep disturbance. It may present a diagnostic dilemma when trying to differentiate from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia. A 76-year-old man with a history of untreated prostate adenocarcinoma was evaluated for subacute cognitive decline, diffuse muscle cramps, and hyponatremia. MRI demonstrated atrophy most prominent in the frontal and temporal regions. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated diffuse myokymia/neuromyotonia. Polysomnography lacked REM and N3 sleep. Paraneoplastic panel detected antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel complex (CASPR2 subtype). It is difficult to differentiate between Morvan syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia with examination and neuroimaging alone. There may be a link between Morvan syndrome and prostate adenocarcinoma which could help with screening/diagnosis.

22764352,[Neurological disease and facial recognition].,"Kawamura, Mitsuru; Sugimoto, Azusa; Kobayakawa, Mutsutaka; Tsuruya, Natsuko",Kawamura,"To discuss the neurological basis of facial recognition, we present our case reports of impaired recognition and a review of previous literature. First, we present a case of infarction and discuss prosopagnosia, which has had a large impact on face recognition research. From a study of patient symptoms, we assume that prosopagnosia may be caused by unilateral right occipitotemporal lesion and right cerebral dominance of facial recognition. Further, circumscribed lesion and degenerative disease may also cause progressive prosopagnosia. Apperceptive prosopagnosia is observed in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), pathologically considered as Alzheimer's disease, and associative prosopagnosia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Second, we discuss face recognition as part of communication. Patients with Parkinson disease show social cognitive impairments, such as difficulty in facial expression recognition and deficits in theory of mind as detected by the reading the mind in the eyes test. Pathological and functional imaging studies indicate that social cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease is possibly related to damages in the amygdalae and surrounding limbic system. The social cognitive deficits can be observed in the early stages of Parkinson disease, and even in the prodromal stage, for example, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show impairment in facial expression recognition. Further, patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1), which is a multisystem disease that mainly affects the muscles, show social cognitive impairment similar to that of Parkinson disease. Our previous study showed that facial expression recognition impairment of DM 1 patients is associated with lesion in the amygdalae and insulae. Our study results indicate that behaviors and personality traits in DM 1 patients, which are revealed by social cognitive impairment, are attributable to dysfunction of the limbic system.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Although an unspecific encephalopathy is the usual form of presentation, acute-onset neurologic symptoms and other atypical manifestations have been described and account for the challenging diagnosis of this entity. Despite being usually detected as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with early-stage tumors or without a previous history of malignancy, a growing concern has arisen from several cases reported in metastatic patients under treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We report what to our knowledge is the first known case of anti-Ma2 encephalitis associated to pembrolizumab and presenting as an acute-onset focal neurological syndrome, consisting on acute global aphasia, right upper limb paresia, hypoacusia, sleep disorder, decreased conscious level and a motor focal status that was refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. A brain MRI scan showed a focal alteration of the cortical-subcortical signal on the left parietal lobe. CSF study found a significant hyperproteinorrhachia and electroencephalography showed lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs), suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy. A positive result for anti-Ma2 antibodies was obtained both in blood and CSF samples through indirect immune-fluorescence (IFI) and later confirmed by western-blot technique. Our patient obtained a mild response to steroid therapy and a significant improvement after the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins. The hypothesis that checkpoint inhibitors may trigger the expression of previously subclinical paraneoplastic events, through the strengthening of cytotoxic T cells-mediated immune response, is supported by our finding of preexisting anti-Ma2 antibodies in preserved blood samples obtained before the initiation of pembrolizumab in our patient. Further research is needed to reveal if the detection of onconeural antibodies prior to a treatment with checkpoint inhibitors may be used as a predictive biomarker of neurologic immune-related high-grade toxicity.",{},,Translational lung cancer research,10.21037/tlcr-21-222,PMC8350103,Anti-Ma2; case report; checkpoint inhibitors; encephalitis; paraneoplastic,Case Reports,China,eng
38178881,A case report of atypical sleep in an ischemic stroke patient with psychiatric symptoms caused by olanzapine.,"Zhao, Huixin; Li, Shuang; Wang, Yanmei",Zhao,"Antipsychotics, tricyclic and 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors can produce dream-rendering behaviors and/or dystonic deregulation during REM sleep. Acute episodes are also seen with withdrawal from alcohol or sedative-hypnotics, and the use of tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants. In this article, we present a case of olanzapine treatment of a patient with cerebrovascular disease with psychobehavioural symptoms. The patient was an elderly patient who developed psychobehavioural symptoms after a sudden cerebral infarction. Initially, his symptoms improved when he took olanzapine (5 mg orally once/night). However, the patient subsequently developed symptoms of hypersomnia when he continued to take olanzapine, and the symptoms of hypersomnia gradually worsened as the dose of olanzapine was gradually increased. Benzodiazepines are often used to treat anomalous sleep, and clonazepam is one of the commonly prescribed drugs. In this case, the patient's abnormal sleep behavior was alleviated after treatment with clonazepam. As an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine has been reported to cause abnormal sleep behavior during clinical use, and only one case has been reported in China. Clinicians should be aware that heteromorphic sleep can occur in patients treated with olanzapine.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.1266204,PMC10765984,RBD (rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder); adverse reactions; anomalous sleep; cerebrovascular disease; olanzapine,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The most common causes of RESLES include infection, antiepileptic drug use and withdrawal, and severe metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, cases of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are uncommon. A 26-year-old female computer programming engineer with no previous medical or psychiatric history reported to the psychiatric hospital due to a 3-day episode of irritability, babbling, limb stiffness, sleepwalking, hallucinations, and paroxysmal mania. Brain MRI revealed abnormal signals of the SCC. Lumbar puncture was performed and further testing for auto-antibodies was conducted in both the CSF and serum. CSF of the patient was positive for anti-NMDAR (titer of 1:3.2) antibodies, and serum was also positive for anti-NMDAR (titer of 1:32) as well as mGluR5 (titer of 1:10) antibodies. Enhanced CT of the pelvis showed an enlarged pelvic mass; bilateral ovarian teratomas (mature teratoma and immature teratoma) were evaluated, which were pathologically confirmed after transabdominal left adnexal resection, right ovarian biopsy, and ovarian cystectomy. The patient considerably improved after intravenous administration of steroids, immunoglobulin, oral prednisone, surgical treatment, and chemotherapy. A follow-up MRI revealed completely resolved lesions. During a 3-month follow-up, the patient experienced complete resolution of symptoms without any sign of recurrence and tumors. The titer of the anti-NMDAR antibody decreased to 1:10 in serum. Herein, we report a rare case of AE with overlapping auto-antibodies, along with RESLES and bilateral ovarian teratomas. The current case provides the possibility of the concurrence of mGluR5 antibodies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Furthermore, we provide additional evidence that overlapping antibodies-related pathology may be one of the many causes of RESLES. Nonetheless, caution should be observed in interpreting the observation, considering that this is a single-case study.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2022.1029294,PMC9878315,anti-N-methyl-D-aspartame receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis; anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; ovarian teratomas; reversible splenial lesion syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

9352423,Resolution of sleep paralysis by weak electromagnetic fields in a patient with multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Sleep paralysis refers to episodes of inability to move during the onset of sleep or more commonly upon awakening. Patients often describe the sensation of struggling to move and may experience simultaneous frightening vivid hallucinations and dreams. Sleep paralysis and other manifestations of dissociated states of wakefulness and sleep, which reflect deficient monoaminergic regulation of neural modulators of REM sleep, have been reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). A 40 year old woman with remitting-progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) experienced episodes of sleep paralysis since the age of 16, four years prior to the onset of her neurological symptoms. Episodes of sleep paralysis, which manifested at a frequency of about once a week, occurred only upon awakening in the morning and were considered by the patient as a most terrifying experience. Periods of mental stress, sleep deprivation, physical fatigue and exacerbation of MS symptoms appeared to enhance the occurrence of sleep paralysis. In July of 1992 the patient began experimental treatment with AC pulsed applications of picotesla intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 5Hz frequency which were applied extracerebrally 1-2 times per week. During the course of treatment with EMFs the patient made a dramatic recovery of symptoms with improvement in vision, mobility, balance, bladder control, fatigue and short term memory. In addition, her baseline pattern reversal visual evoked potential studies, which showed abnormally prolonged latencies in both eyes, normalized 3 weeks after the initiation of magnetic therapy and remained normal more than 2.5 years later. Since the introduction of magnetic therapy episodes of sleep paralysis gradually diminished and abated completely over the past 3 years. This report suggests that MS may be associated with deficient REM sleep inhibitory neural mechanisms leading to sleep paralysis secondary to the intrusion of REM sleep atonia and dream imagery into the waking state. Pineal melatonin and monoaminergic neurons have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of REM sleep and the pathogenesis of sleep paralysis and it is suggested that resolution of sleep paralysis in this patient by AC pulsed applications of EMFs was related to enhancement of melatonin circadian rhythms and cerebral serotoninergic neurotransmission.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459709000634,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

In this study the clinical case of a female patient with IgLON5 antibody disease and the response to treatment is described. Here we report on the case of a 67-year-old female patient who showed cognitive deterioration, gait difficulties, and chronic obstructive sleep disorder. The diagnostic course showed a positive anti-IgLON5 serum and anti-IgLON5 IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid.

Treatment of ESES is assumed to improve cognitive outcome. The aim of this study is to create an overview of the current evidence for different treatment regimens in children with ESES syndrome. A literature search using PubMed and Embase was performed. Articles were selected that contain original treatment data of patients with ESES syndrome. Authors were contacted for additional information. Individual patient data were collected, coded, and analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The three predefined main outcome measures were improvement in cognitive function, electroencephalography (EEG) pattern, and any improvement (cognition or EEG). The literature search yielded 1,766 articles. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 112 articles and 950 treatments in 575 patients could be analyzed. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs, n = 495) were associated with improvement (i.e., cognition or EEG) in 49% of patients, benzodiazepines (n = 171) in 68%, and steroids (n = 166) in 81%. Surgery (n = 62) resulted in improvement in 90% of patients. In a subgroup analysis of patients who were consecutively reported (585 treatments in 282 patients), we found improvement in a smaller proportion treated with AEDs (34%), benzodiazepines (59%), and steroids (75%), whereas the improvement percentage after surgery was preserved (93%). Possible predictors of improved outcome were treatment category, normal development before ESES onset, and the absence of structural abnormalities. Although most included studies were small and retrospective and their heterogeneity allowed analysis of only qualitative outcome data, this pooled analysis suggests superior efficacy of steroids and surgery in encephalopathy with ESES.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Epilepsia,10.1111/epi.13128,,Continuous spikes and waves during sleep; Epilepsy; Landau-Kleffner syndrome; Meta-analysis; Systematic review,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Systematic Review",United States,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging showed thalamic and hippocampal signal abnormalities, immunohistochemistry on a mouse brain substrate revealed serum autoantibodies binding to the brainstem neuropil. Polysomnographic monitoring was consistent with a very severe disruption of sleep: the sleep-wake cycle was fragmented, and the NREM-REM ultradian cycle was irregular. Intravenous immune globulin therapy resulted in the complete reversal of the movement and the sleep disorders. Our observation confirms that parkinsonism and sleep disorders may be consequences of encephalitis, that an immune-mediated pathogenesis is likely, and, consequently, that immunotherapy can be beneficial in these patients.

Symptoms are improved by movement. Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Lesion-related RLS has been reported, mainly in cases of stroke-related RLS involving the brainstem and lenticulostriate nuclei. Only few data of RLS in a context of spinal cord injury have been reported. We report the case of a woman with secondary RLS due to hemorrhage of a spinal cord cavernoma located at T9-T10. Following recovery from the acute phase of the hemorrhage, the patient began to complain about restlessness in her legs causing impaired sleep and daytime somnolence. Polysomnographic investigations found a high index of periodic leg movements during sleep (71/hour), but no sleep disordered breathing. Iron stores were normal. Relief of symptom's severity was obtained with gabapentin 600mg in the evening. We hypothesize a possible involvement of the diencephalospinal pathway in the patient's RLS pathophysiology. A systematic study of focal lesions associated with RLS may contribute to improving our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this condition. The frequency of RLS associated with lesions of the spinal cord might be underestimated.

31632341,Anti-IgLON5 Disease: A Case With 11-Year Clinical Course and Review of the Literature.,"Nissen, Mette Scheller; Blaabjerg, Morten",Nissen,"<b>Background:</b> Anti-IgLON5 disease is a novel disorder with a complex interplay between inflammation and neurodegeneration. Patients develop antibodies against IgLON5 but also deposition of neuronal tau protein. Symptoms often have an insidious onset, slow progression and mimic other neurological disorders. Here we report a case with severely prolonged 11-year disease course and provide a review of current reported cases with focus on presentation, work-up, treatment, and outcome. <b>Method:</b> All reported cases of anti-IgLON5 disease were evaluated. Cases reported twice (in case series and as single case reports), were carefully excluded. <b>Results:</b> Most patients display a characteristic sleep disorder with severe insomnia, non rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnia, with finalistic movements and sleep disordered breathing (stridor and obstructive sleep apnea). Other symptoms are bulbar involvement, gait instability, movement disorders, oculomotor abnormalities, dysautonomia, and peripheral symptoms. Antibodies are present in both serum and CSF and there is a strong correlation with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1<sup>*</sup>10:01 and HLA-DQB1<sup>*</sup>05:01. Neuropathological examination reveals neurodegeneration with neuronal tau deposits in regions that correlate with the clinical presentation (e.g., predominantly hypothalamus and tegmentum of the brain stem). Majority of cases respond partially to immunotherapy. Cases, who received no treatment or treatment with IV corticosteroids alone, had a higher mortality than cases treated with more potent immunotherapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> The clinical spectrum of Anti-IgLON5 disease continues to expand. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology, therapeutic strategies and outcome in this novel disorder. Aggressive immunotherapy seems to increase survival.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2019.01056,PMC6783555,IgLON5; autoimmune encephalitis; immunology; inflammation; tau,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) was diagnosed and treated. Because of persistent EDS, snoring and nycturia, a nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) was performed. PSG showed high sleep fragmentation related to a moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) was proposed. Because of the persistence of abnormal nocturnal behaviours, characterized by screaming, punching and falling out of bed, a video-PSG with CPAP treatment was performed. The recording showed typical chin electromyography (EMG) activity increase associated with violent movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting REM sleep behaviour disorders (RBD). Clinical neurological examination found no parkinsonian syndrome, no dysautonomic sign and no neurological focal sign. Dopamine transporter imaging [123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] did not find any presynaptic dopaminergic pathways degeneration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a vascular lesion suggestive of cavernoma located in the pons.

MRI findings of the brain demonstrate deep white matter abnormalities. We report 2 cases of DPL after hypoxia due to benzodiazepine overdose. Both of our patients had normal arylsulfatase A activity. Although DPL is seen in carbon monoxide poisoning, pseudodeficiency of arylsulfatase A activity, or drug overdose with heroin or morphine, there are only some previous studies of DPL caused by an overdose with benzodiazepine. It is unclear whether neurotoxicity from the drug in addition to hypoxia alone is involved, however, it is important to note that overdose of common drugs as sleeping medicine can cause DPL. Since DPL may often be misdiagnosed and be subjected to unnecessary treatments, it is also important to understand its unique clinical course and MRI findings. With prompt recognition of DPL, we expect that more cases of DPL caused by overdose with benzodiazepine will be diagnosed, because benzodiazepine overdoses are common.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.52.672,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may be a complication in some neurological diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of subacute psychosis and SIADH as the manifestation of HE, observed in the present case, has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man was hospitalized with a 4-month history of abnormal behaviors, including talkativeness, stopping consumption of coffee and cigarettes, hoarding garbage, and sleep disorders. On physical examination, increased and incoherent speech with flight of idea and delusion were observed. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28/30. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia due to SIADH and a positive result for anti-thyroid and anti-NH2 terminal of alpha-enolase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed only elevation of IL-6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable; however, (I-123)-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed extensive hyperperfusion involving the brainstem and bilateral frontal and medial temporal lobes. Electroencephalography showed generalized slow waves, but there were no epileptiform discharges. After 2 courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, his symptoms improved. Based on the findings of clinical features and steroid responsiveness, he was diagnosed with HE. Oral prednisolone and antipsychotic drugs were decreased without a relapse and he was discharged to his home.

Frey and Heiserman, however, found pontine MRI abnormalities in only two of 12 patients with narcolepsy both of whom had long-standing hypertension (2). Pullicino et al. noted similar pontine MRI abnormalities in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy-like ischemic rarefaction of the pons (3).

The Daily Cognitive-Communication and Sleep Profile (D-CCASP), Clinical Interview, Epworth and Stanford Sleepiness Scales and polysomnography assessed sleep and wakefulness. Cognitive-communication was also assessed by the D-CCASP. His sleep, wake and mood difficulties were pharmacologically managed. Baseline polysomnography indicated abnormal sleep. There was a clear positive relationship between quality of sleep, language processing, attention and memory, seen across the phases of the medication intervention (p < 0.01). A comprehensive pharmacological management programme addressing the multi-factorial underlying aetiology was successful in improving sleep, arousal and mood. The D-CCASP was found to be clinically and statistically sensitive to reported changes in cognitive-communication function in relation to improvements in sleep and daytime arousal. These findings suggest that management of sleep/wake disturbances and mood post-traumatic brain injury can potentially facilitate improvements in cognitive-communication function which may, in turn, facilitate participation in rehabilitation and community integration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2011.608215,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Symptoms include somnolence, fever, nausea and vomiting, and headache. The authors report a 29 year-old female who developed symptoms compatible with the somnolence syndrome after completing radiation therapy for a benign meningioma near the pineal region. Five weeks after completing conformal radiation therapy (54 Gy), she developed profound fatigue, headaches, and 102-degree fevers. Physical examination and routine laboratory work were unrevealing. Imaging was not performed. Prednisone was prescribed and within 1 week her symptoms had largely resolved. This is the first report of the somnolence syndrome after focal radiation therapy.

Brainstem disorders of subacute onset (onset and progression with accumulation of disabling deficits in 6-12 weeks) are generally of autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, or infiltrative neoplastic cause. An autoimmune or infectious brainstem disorder may be referred to as brainstem encephalitis or rhombencephalitis. We describe a patient with paraneoplastic autoimmune rhombencephalitis, in whom diagnostic clues included the following: diverse visual and sleep symptoms, trismus, and choking in the history; see-saw nystagmus, opsoclonus, dysarthria, jaw dystonia, and episodic laryngospasm on examination; subtle but longitudinal and nonenhancing T2 MRI abnormalities in the brainstem and upper cervical cord; and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. His movement disorder-specific neural IgG profile revealed ANNA-2 (anti-Ri) and KLHL-11-IgG. Both are biomarkers of paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. KLCHL-11-IgG has been reported to accompany germ cell tumors, which was found in a solitary metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node in our patient, along with an atrophic left testis. Multidisciplinary treatment (autoimmune neurology, sleep medicine, ophthalmology, and physiatry) led to significant clinical improvements. This case provides a framework for the evaluation of patients with subacute-onset brainstem syndromes and the investigation and management of those with paraneoplastic and other autoimmune diseases.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000200950,PMC9502740,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, neuroimaging, and outcome characteristics in a case series of patients with lesional RBD. This is a retrospective case series from a tertiary care referral center. A total of 10 patients with lesional RBD were identified. Seven (70%) were men, with an average age of sleep symptom onset of 53.7 ± 17.0 years. Structural pathology evident on neuroimaging included four extraaxial (three meningiomas and one basilar fusiform aneurysm with brainstem compression) and six intraaxial (encephalomalacia, multiple sclerosis, vasculitis, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, and leukodystrophy) lesions. No patient developed parkinsonian features or cognitive impairment suggestive of synucleinopathy over an average of 45.4 ± 35.2 months of follow-up. RBD is rarely associated with non-synuclein structural lesions affecting the pons, medulla, or limbic system.

Baseline analysis included 351 consecutively enrolled veterans in the Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders longitudinal cohort study. One hundred eighty-six returned for a follow-up evaluation averaging 24 months post baseline. The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) was used to measure NBS reporting. Predictor variables included diagnosis of military-related mild traumatic brain injury (M-mTBI), psychological measures, including posttraumatic stress disorder, mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, and behavioral measures, including self-reported current pain and sleep impairment. Hierarchical and multivariable regression analyses examined the relationships between the predictor variables and NSI scores. The <i>k</i>-fold cross-validation assessed generalizability and validity of the regressions. Baseline analysis revealed that psychological and behavioral conditions independently accounted for 42.5% of variance in the NSI total score compared to 1.5% for M-mTBI after controlling for psychological and behavioral conditions. Prospective analysis revealed that M-mTBI at baseline did not significantly predict NSI score at follow-up, while psychological and behavioral measures at baseline independently accounted for 24.5% of NSI variance. Posttraumatic stress disorder was the most consistent predictor. Cross-validation analyses supported generalizability of the results. Psychological and behavioral-related measures are strong predictors of persistent NBS reporting in veterans, while M-mTBI is negligible. NBS more likely reflect influential comorbidities as opposed to brain injury, per se.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000006034,PMC6107265,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

We also studied its pathological features, the postoperative mortality and morbidity related to radical surgical resection, and the implemented adjuvant therapies. Due to its classical clinical features and its close resemblance to other lesions in the region, it is an entity unlikely to be suspected prior to its histological diagnosis. Despite the benign nature of this tumor, the clinical outcome might be poor.

The occurrence of WE is rarely reported in patients with cerebral infarction, who often have complications of malnutrition. Cerebral infarction is a neurological disease, patients with cerebral infarction may show symptoms such as disturbance of consciousness and gait instability, which is difficult to differentiate from WE. Thus, early recognition and differential diagnosis of WE are important. We report a rare case of cerebral infarction patient who developed WE due to malnutrition and parenteral nutrition. A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with cerebral infarction. She had lost 15 kg of weight in the past month or so and was diagnosed with malnutrition. In order to correct malnutrition, parenteral nutrition and intravenous glucose without thiamine were administered. Cognitive dysfunction, laloplegia, sleep rhythm inversion, somnolence and bilateral lower limbs weakness were presented 20 days after admission. Brain magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of WE. The patient was given thiamine and nutrition support therapy. The patient's cognitive impairment, laloplegia and sleep condition improved within 4 days. Neurological status continued to improve and physical activity recovered gradually within 2 weeks. She received rehabilitation training when her condition was relatively stable, and her muscle strength of limbs and physical function gradually improved. Infarction-related malnutrition may result in nutrient deficiency-related neurological complications, such as WE. Thus, it is important to pay close attention to the nutritional status of patients with cerebral infarction. In addition, early recognition and differential diagnosis of WE in patients with infarction-related malnutrition are necessary, early treatment of replete thiamine supplementation and nutrition support therapy can reduce the risk of WE and improve the prognosis.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000019799,PMC7440183,,Case Reports,United States,eng

Three years earlier, a physician at another institution diagnosed idiopathic DI and prescribed desmopressin. At that time, laboratory workup and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no brain lesions or other hormonal irregularities. Slow, progressive symptomatology in the following 3 years included mental status changes, nonhealing skin lesions, recurrent infections, temperature dysregulation, and midsection weight gain. She became withdrawn and emotionally labile and developed a flat affect, short-term memory loss, poor concentration, and sleep disturbance. MRI revealed a 2.2 x 2.1 x 1.9-cm suprasellar region lesion. Biopsy samples from the third ventricular lesion revealed a circumscribed glial tumor. Chordoid glioma is a rare tumor, and the 50 previously reported cases have been located in the suprasellar region. This is the third reported case of a chordoid glioma positive for neurofilament protein, which brings into question the hypothesis of a single phenotype for glial tumors. Tumors in this region frequently result in endocrine dysfunction that prompts patients to seek medical attention. There is no formally recognized treatment protocol for chordoid glioma, and postoperative mortality and morbidity is high. Our report emphasizes the necessity of close follow-up of patients after a diagnosis of idiopathic DI.

RBD may be idiopathic or associated with various neurological diseases involving the brainstem. The association of RBD and limbic system impairment was unclear. We report a 46-year-old man with acute aseptic limbic encephalitis in association with RBD. The patient presented with subacute onset of anterograde/retrograde amnesia and persistent fever. Abnormal nocturnal behavior during sleep consisted of waving hands to fight and kicking legs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed damage on the bilateral unci and medial temporal lobes. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated aseptic encephalitis. A polysomnography revealed augmented phasic activity in the submental and bilateral tibialis anterior muscles during REM sleep.

Six cases of extreme state dissociation are presented, with a review of the human and animal clinical and experimental literature. This multiple component concept of state determination must be kept in mind when pharmacologic or lesion studies are employed to suppress one or another state.

We report the case of a middle-aged woman with extreme malnutrition caused by complications of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery who presented with signs and symptoms of severe thiamine deficiency and septic shock. A 43-year-old woman who had undergone RYGB surgery and who had multiple complications presented to the emergency department with agitation, confusion, and lethargy. The physical examination revealed an obtunded woman appearing much older than her reported age with significant peripheral edema. She was hypoxemic, hypotensive, and febrile. The initial laboratory analysis revealed a serum lactate level above the measurable limit, a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone, and elevated levels of troponin and brain natriuretic peptide. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed high-output heart failure. The patient's family later revealed that for the past year her diet had consisted almost exclusively of frozen blended lattes. High doses of thiamine and folate were started. Her shock, hyperlactatemia, and respiratory failure resolved by hospital day 3 and her encephalopathy resolved soon thereafter. Why Should an Emergency Physician be Aware of This?: Thiamine deficiency is a rare but reversible cause of shock, heart failure, and encephalopathy. Identifying patients who are at risk for severe nutritional deficiencies may aid in more rapid treatment with relatively benign medications with little downside, in this case high-dose vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, and ultimately improve patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, and hospital length of stay.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.03.010,,Beriberi; High-output heart failure; Lactate; Nutritional deficiency; Sepsis; Wernicke encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years. Cerebrospinal IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-15, CCL5, G-CSF, PDGFbb, and VFGF were raised in the early stage of initial medical attention with nonspecific complaints, but were less prominent in the later stages of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms.

Overlapping brainstem regions modulate visual pathways and REM sleep functions via gating of thalamocortical networks. A 66-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed abrupt-onset complex visual hallucinations with preserved insight and violent dream enactment behavior. Brain MRI showed restricted diffusion in the left rostrodorsal pons suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) was diagnosed on polysomnography. We investigated the integrity of ponto-geniculate-occipital circuits with seed-based resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) in this patient compared to 46 controls. Rs-fcMRI revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity between the lesion and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN), and between LGN and visual association cortex compared to controls. Conversely, functional connectivity between brainstem and visual association cortex, and between visual association cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly increased in the patient. Focal damage to the rostrodorsal pons is sufficient to cause RBD and PH in humans, suggesting an overlapping mechanism in both syndromes. This lesion produced a pattern of altered functional connectivity consistent with disrupted visual cortex connectivity via de-afferentation of thalamocortical pathways.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.10.015,PMC4820074,Hallucinations; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Lesion; Lewy body dementia; Pareidolia; Parkinson's disease; Prefrontal cortex; Resting state fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

TM suffered significant brain damage as a result of a large subarachnoid haemorrhage of his right anterior cerebral artery complicated by midline shift and subsequent infarction of his left middle cerebral artery. In addition to challenging behaviour and cognitive impairment, TM presented with a recurrent disturbed sleep-wake pattern that significantly worsened his quality-of-life.

He was diagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) finally. The patient had been diagnosed and treated as stroke in the local hospital, while urinary and anal incontinence were not relieved. It was a dilemma for him to be properly diagnosed and treated. Polysomnography in our hospital revealed apnea hypopnea index (AHI) at 44.7 events/h, oxygen desaturation index (ODI) at 70.8 events/h and the longest apnea time at 185 seconds while the lowest blood oxygen saturation reduced to 31%. In addition, 413 events of apnea accounted for 61.2% of the sleep time and the minimal heart rate was 23 times/min. The patient was diagnosed as severe OSAHS with hypoxia metabolic brain disease, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, secondary polycythemia and obesity hypoventilation syndrome finally. He received the treatment of positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilator with an average pressure at 11.7 cmH2O with reduced AHI and increased blood oxygen saturation. The urinary and anal incontinence disappeared during the first night of treatment and it has been totally resolved so far. We considered that gatism was secondary to OSAHS with severe hypoxia resulted from attenuated regulation of primary defecation in the night. Physicians should pay attention to OSAHS when accepting obese patients with nocturnal incontinence, obvious daytime sleepiness and night snoring.

(1977), the question of differential right vs. left hemispheric involvement in REM-sleep dreaming. A male subject with extensive lesioning of the right hemisphere and consequent contralateral homonymous hemianopia was studied for 2 nights in a sleep laboratory where a dream report was collected following each of 6 awakenings from REM sleep. The subject's dream reports were typically sequential and narrative in form, but were lacking specifically in continuous visual imagery. The occasional visual images that appeared in the subject's dreams were described as fragmentary and static in nature. The subject also was unable to perform waking tasks requiring the kinematic representation of extrapersonal space. These observations support the hypotheses that dream narratives may derive from different neurocognitive sources than do the specifically visual realizations of those narratives, and that the visual mediation of dream experience may depend on right-hemispheric processing. Differences between our findings and those of Greenwood et al. may be attributable to differences in dream interview technique.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(81)80066-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Italy,eng

Total insomnia and the initial suppression of dreaming was followed by the gradual recovery of both functions. A visual hallucinosis during waking that was associated with the initial period of sleep and dream suppression is described in detail. Since the changes in sleep and their recovery are comparable to results of animal experiments, it can be concluded that damage to the medullary brain stem causes extreme but short-lived alterations in conscious state and that substantial recovery occurs even though the damage to the brain stem endures.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1016/s1053-8100(02)00011-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Mean age (+/- SD) at presentation was 37.4 (+/- 9.1) yr (range 18-54); 73.7% of the patients (n = 14) were female. Mean age of sleep-related eating onset was 24.7 (+/- 12.9) yr (range 5-44). Eating occurred from sleep nightly in 57.9% (n = 11) of patients. Chief complaints included excessive weight gain, concerns about choking while eating or about starting fires from cooking and sleep disruption. Extensive polysomnographic studies, clinical evaluations and treatment outcome data identified three etiologic categories for the sleep-related eating: (a) sleepwalking (SW), 84.2% (n = 16); (b) periodic movements of sleep (PMS), 10.5% (n = 2) and (c) triazolam abuse (0.75 mg hs), 5.3% (n = 1). DSM-III Axis 1 psychiatric disorders (affective, anxiety) were present in 47.4% (n = 9) of the patients, and only two patients had a daytime eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), each in remission for 3-7 yr. Nearly half of all patients fulfilled established criteria for being overweight, based on the body mass index. Onset of sleep-related eating was linked directly to the onset of SW, PMS, triazolam abuse, nicotine abstinence, chronic autoimmune hepatitis, narcolepsy, encephalitis or acute stress. In the SW group, 72.7% (8/11) of patients had nocturnal eating and other SW behavior suppressed by clonazepam (n = 7) and/or bromocriptine (n = 2) treatment. Both patients with PMS likewise responded to treatment with combinations of carbidopa/L-dopa, codeine and clonazepam.

However, some other symptoms, such as mental disorder or abnormal behavior, are atypical, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of epilepsy, sleepwalking, infarction, or mental disorder, among others. We report a case of a patient with type 2 diabetes who presented with abnormal nocturnal behavior due to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia was diagnosed based on a blood glucose level of 2.1 mmol/L when the patient turned up disoriented unresponsive, unable to understand what was said to him, and producing nonsensical speech. After the patient ate a piece of chocolate, his consciousness returned to normal and all mental symptoms disappeared. Polysomnography (PSG) was synchronously performed. The results of the PSG did not show any signs of abnormality during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We regulated his dose of insulin. No additional episodes occurred during the 3-month follow-up. Therefore, the abnormal nocturnal behavior of this patient was determined to be due to hypoglycemia, while the cause of the hypoglycemia was insulin overuse. For physicians, if the cause of abnormal behavior cannot be detected, hypoglycemia should be suspected.

While most of the nocturnal bruxism cases seen in the general population are apparently idiopathic, it has been reported to be associated with a range of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease, cranio-cervical dystonia and post-anoxic brain damage, but not multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe three cases of MS patients who have had moderate to severe complaints of bruxism in the two weeks following their relevant MS attacks. None of the three patients had a diagnosis of bruxism prior to her attack. The diagnosis was confirmed in one out of three by a polysomnography. One patient did not have any complaints related to bruxism previous to her attack, whereas two had mild and infrequent complaints. The symptoms of the relevant attacks were left hemihypesthesia in all and hemiparesis in two. None of the patients had spasticity that could result in severe teeth clenching. All three patients presented with morning headaches and jaw pain or tightness and were treated successfully with botulinum toxin (Btx) injections applied to their masseter and temporalis muscles. The cause of bruxism is controversial but lesions of the cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cotrical loops are thought to be most likely.

Intravenous administration of thiamine resulted in recovery from the delirium within three days. Serum thiamine level was found to be 16 ng/ml (normal range: 24-66 ng/ml). The clinical findings, the low level of thiamine in the serum, and the effective alleviation of delirious symptoms after thiamine administration fulfilled Francis's criteria for delirium induced by thiamine deficiency. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of Wernicke encephalopathy in cancer patients, especially in those with loss of appetite for longer than 18 days. The degree of appetite loss in such patients might serve as a reference. Early detection and intervention may alleviate the symptoms of delirium and prevent irreversible brain damage.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Palliative & supportive care,10.1017/S1478951515000875,,Cancer; Delirium; Thiamine deficiency; Wernicke encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
11379730,Drug dreams: a neuropsychoanalytic hypothesis.,"Johnson, B",Johnson,"Recent studies have shown that the ventral tegmental pathway stimulates both dreaming and drug craving. To investigate a possible clinical link between these two psychic phenomena, psychotherapy notes from the first six months of an addicted patient's treatment were reviewed, together with verbatim notes from the four years of psychoanalysis that followed. Of 240 dreams reported by the patient,58 had manifest content involving the seeking or using of drugs. There was no particular temporal or emotional thematic pattern to these ""drug dreams,""which persisted through four and a half years of sobriety. Drug dreams are observable phenomena that reflect both the innate structure of the brain and neural changes produced by exposure to addictive drugs. In some addicted persons, exposure to drugs produces a fixed change in neurological functioning with which they must contend for years, possibly the rest of their lives. Drug craving meets Freud's defining characteristics for a drive: it is a constant pressure, originating from within the organism, to do work, and it constantly demands satisfaction. Because ego and libidinal drives share a common neural pathway, they should not be separated conceptually. Solms's finding (in press) that the activating systems for dreaming and for craving are identical, a finding based on observations of tumor- or stroke-provoked brain lesions, is confirmed by observation of the dreams of a patient whose brain changes were created by drug exposure. This study provides further evidence that the origin of the dream is a wish.",{},,Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association,10.1177/00030651010490011101,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neuropsychological testing showed lack of cognitive disturbances and post-operative depression. Two working hypotheses were tested to find neuromarkers of depression and anxiety. In line with the 'depression hypothesis' a frontal alpha asymmetry pattern was found in the patient, and in line with the 'anxiety' hypothesis an increased left temporal P1 wave in response to visual stimuli was found in ERPs. A specific alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol combined with an anodal tDCS was suggested. Twenty sessions of individually-tailored anodal tDCs/ neurofeedback protocol were performed. The QEEG frontal asymmetry pattern and the excessive temporal P1 wave were normalized after the intervention.

The behavioral effects of RSD include the enhancement of motivational and ""drive""-related behaviors. In laboratory animals, RSD has been reported to increase appetite, sexual behavior, aggressiveness, and locomotor activity. Moreover, RSD reportedly improves mood in patients with endogenous depression and heightens appetite and sexual interest in normal subjects. Since ""drive""-related behaviors are thought to involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites, RSD may enhance motivational behaviors through an action on limbic dopaminergic functions. In the present communication, we present two patients (one with multiple sclerosis and the other with Parkinson's disease) in whom treatment with magnetic fields produced behavioral effects which paralleled those observed in REM-sleep-deprived animals and humans. We propose, therefore, that the behavioral and mental effects of treatment with magnetic fields may be mediated via RSD and, by inference, involve activation of limbic dopaminergic reward sites.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459209003278,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

SN's neuropsychological, structural and functional imaging findings are compared with similar reported cases and are discussed in the framework of fronto-subcortical circuits and their proposed behavioural disorders. SN's mania was characterized by restlessness, mood elevation, a tendency for pleasurable activities, inflated self-esteem and loss of disease awareness. Other symptoms were sexual disinhibition, tactlessness, abnormal discourse, and reduced need for food and sleep. His neuropsychological assessment revealed an anterograde amnesia, and an impairment of frontal-executive functions. A SPECT-study showed diaschisis-related areas of hypoperfusion in both prefrontal regions which were interpreted as equivalents of SN's frontal-dysexecutive syndrome. In addition, there was a perfusion deficit in the right orbitofrontal cortex, which was taken as the imaging correlate of SN's secondary mania and personality disorder. These findings suggest that SN's mania and his other symptoms result from the twofold disruption of fronto-subcortical connections, namely of the right orbitofrontal loop which is concerned with mood regulation and socially appropriate behaviour, and of the dorsolateral prefrontal loop which mediates executive cognitive functions.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00108-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11097526,Nucleus of the tractus solitarius metastasis: relationship to respiratory arrest?,"Rhodes, R H; Wightman, H R",Rhodes,"A 52-year-old woman with metastases in brain and bone had clinical and radiological response to therapy but died about 10 weeks after diagnosis. General autopsy failed to identify a primary neoplasm or an anatomic cause of death. Investigation of sudden respiratory cessation was a consideration when undertaking an anatomic study of the brain. Review of patient records and careful examination of the brain following autopsy were carried out. The patient had terminal episodes of hypersomnia but episodes of sleep apnea were not observed. She received no respiratory support and no respiratory difficulties were recorded until she was pronounced dead at 7 a.m. Autopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma in a pattern suggestive of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, including multiple cerebral metastases, although no significant pulmonary lesions of any type were found. A 0.2 cm metastatic adenocarcinoma was found in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). No other tumor was present in the brain stem. Unilateral destruction of the NTS in the medulla would have severely disturbed the most critical point of convergence of autonomic and voluntary respiratory control and of cardiocirculatory reflexes in the central autonomic network. It is postulated that this caused respiratory arrest during a state transition from sleeping to waking. Few metastases to the medulla are reported, most are relatively large, and several have caused respiratory symptoms before death. The very small metastasis in our patient could be the direct anatomic cause of death, and as such it is an unusual complication of metastatic disease of which clinicians should be aware. It is speculated that dysfunction of direct NTS connections to the pons or of connections passing close to the metastatic deposit resulted in terminal hypersomnia.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Two young men who sustained severe internal and orthopaedic injuries after a motor vehicle accident are described. The conscious patient denied their having used stupefacients, but toxicological analysis upon arrival at the operating room detected methylenedioxymethamphetamine, the metabolite methylenedioxyamphetamine and methamphetamine in their blood and urine specimens. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine concentrations in the clotted blood and in the urine ranged between 0.9-1.15 and 55-70 mg/l, respectively. Methylenedioxyamphetamine concentrations for both patients were less than 0.2 mg/l in the blood and 2.0-3.0 mg/l in the urine. Each had a blood methamphetamine concentration greater than 250 ng/ml. There was no trace of alcohol. Three days after their arrival at the hospital, acute liver insufficiency and mild rhabdomyolysis (serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1245/218 mU/ml, creatine phosphokinase 48 000 U/ml, respectively) were diagnosed in both patients. Appropriate treatment was administered in an intensive care area and both were discharged home several weeks later without sequelae. These findings suggest that in this era of the widespread abuse of 'ecstasy', concentrations of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine or metamphetamine should be sought routinely in motor vehicle accident victims admitted to emergency services with an altered state of consciousness so that the early monitoring of the potential development of organ pathology can be implemented.",{},,European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,10.1097/00063110-200303000-00006,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The evolution of cognitive deficits in the latter population and their relationship to the post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome are poorly understood. We report the outcome at 12 months after severe COVID-19 involving an intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation in six (five Caucasian and one Asian) patients (age range: 53-71 years, mean age 61.7 ± 6.5 years) without history of prior brain dysfunction and without stroke and/or cardiac arrest during or after COVID-19. All patients reported pervading mental and physical fatigue as well as numerous multidomain complaints, which impacted everyday life. Individual patients described mental fatigability, apathy, and/or anxiety. Standardized neuropsychological tests revealed isolated symptoms of cognitive dysfunction or performance at the lower limit of the norm in the attentional, executive, and/or working memory domains in four of the six patients. Somatic scales documented dyspnoea, muscle weakness, olfactory disorder, and/or minor sleep problems in some, but not all, patients. Fatigue, fatigability, multidomain complaints, cognitive difficulties, or dysfunction, as well as isolated neurobehavioral and/or psychiatric and/or somatic symptoms, tend to occur in the aftermath of severe COVID-19 and persist at 12 months, even in the absence of prior and/or COVID-19-related brain damage.

We report the case of a 30 year-old male patient who presented with total insomnia followed by episodes of psychomotor restlessness resembling anxiety attacks. Twenty days later, he developed refractory convulsive status epilepticus with admission to Intensive Care Unit. He progressed to a state of reduced alertness and responsiveness, presenting periods of agitation with abnormal dyskinetic movements, periods of autonomic instability and central hypoventilation. Workup revealed antibodies against N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Immunotherapy treatment led to a very significant improvement with the patient presenting only slight frontal lobe dysfunction after one year of recovery. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis first presenting with total insomnia. Our aim is to alert that anti-NMDAR encephalitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of FI, especially in sporadic cases. Distinguishing the two conditions is very important as, contrarily to the fatal disclosure of FI, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is potentially reversible with adequate treatment even after severe and prolonged disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2013.10.034,,Autoimmune encephalitis; Immunotherapy; NMDAR encephalitis; Sporadic fatal insomnia; Total insomnia; Video-EEG monitoring,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Case-control study of patients with OSA attending a specialist sleep clinic and matched control subjects drawn from the normal community. Forty-five sleep clinic patients with moderate to severe OSA and excessive daytime sleepiness, matched to 45 control subjects without excessive sleepiness or evidence of OSA on a sleep study. Matched variables included age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol and cigarette consumption, treated hypertension, and ischaemic heart disease. N/A. All subjects underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings (before treatment in OSA patients) and sagittal T1, axial T2, and coronal dual echo cerebral MRI imaging to detect clinically silent abnormalities related to hypertensive cerebrovascular disease; areas of high signal foci in deep white matter (DWM), lacunae, and periventricular hyperintensity. Lacunae/high signal foci in DWM and/or periventricular hyperintensity were present in 15 (33%) OSA subjects and 16 (35%) controls, despite significant increases in mean daytime diastolic blood pressure (4.6mmHg, p<0.05), and both nighttime diastolic (7.2mmHg, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressures (9.2mmHg, p<0.05) in OSA subjects. These data exclude more than a 17% excess prevalence of MRI detected minor cerebrovascular disease in the OSA patients, with 95% confidence.

The most common one is insomnia, which can exacerbate other post-injury symptoms, including fatigue, impaired cognition, depression, anxiety, and pain. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a manualized treatment that effectively treats insomnia with secondary effects on cognition, mood, and pain in various populations. This paper reviews the use of CBT-I for three participants with TBI of different severities. Pre- and post-treatment assessments of insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain were conducted. Mood was further assessed at follow-up. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) scores derived from the research literature were used to establish clinically meaningful symptom improvement on self-report questionnaires. The reduction in insomnia severity scores for all three participants were not large enough to be considered a clinically significant improvement following CBT-I, although trends toward improvement were observed. However, all participants showed clinically significant reductions in anxiety at post-treatment; the effects persisted for 2 participants at follow-up. Reductions in depression symptoms were observed for 2 participants at post-treatment, and treatment effects persisted for 1 participant at follow-up. One participant endorsed clinically significant improvements in fatigue and pain severity.

We describe a 38-year-old woman with severe daytime sleepiness, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and bilateral delayed visual evoked potentials. Her multiple sleep latency test results demonstrated short sleep latencies and 4 sleep-onset rapid eye movement sleep periods, and her cerebrospinal fluid contained a low concentration of hypocretin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity along the walls of the third ventricle and aqueduct, which are consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. After treatment with steroids, this patient's subjective sleepiness, hypersomnia, and hypocretin deficiency partially improved. Autoimmune diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis can produce narcolepsy.

In most of the cases the hallucination is accompanied by sleeping disorder, and is by the patient recognized as not being real. It can be observed mainly in patients with thalamic/midbrain vascular disease, and is less frequently seen in brain stem tumor. The damage of the ascending reticular activating system by brain stem compression causing dream activity releasing what is normally suppressed during wakefulness is thought to be the mechanism of peduncular hallucinosis. The authors report a 13-year-old female presenting peduncular hallucinosis due to brainstem compression by a pineocytoma. The patient had a 3-month history of complex visual hallucination and slight somnolence. The hallucination mainly consisted of TV game characters, animals, and vegetables which were colorful and vivid. She was well oriented and realized that the hallucination was not real. MRI showed a pineal mass compressing the quadrigeminal plate inferiorly. There was mild obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis. The tumor was totally removed and was pathologically diagnosed as pineocytoma. After the surgery, the hallucination ameliorated remarkably. Although the administration of benzodiazepine exacerbated the hallucination and sleep disorder, oral carbamazepine was clearly effective and produced nearly complete disappearance of hallucination.

11051793,[Consideration on neuroimaging and functional diagnosis in cerebrovascular disorder].,"Nozawa, T",Nozawa,"The electroencephalogram(EEG) has been one of the important clinical examination in cerebrovascular disorder(CVD). Since X-ray computed tomography(CT) was introduced in the 1970's, the numbers of EEG examination decreased in Japan. In the present, the diagnosis of acute CVD is done by neuroimaging examinations which generally are CT, magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and at times, single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT). But EEG examination is necessary for estimate of brain function in acute and/or chronic CVD. Only EEG examination is able to confirm epileptic seizure, sleep-wake disorder and disturbance of consciousness. alpha-coma and spindle coma are peculiar disturbance of consciousness and appear in acute CVD. REM sleep behavior disorder(RBD) sometimes appear in chronic CVD. The characteristic of RBD is violent or injurious behavior during REM sleep. Polysomnography demonstrates abnormal REM sleep without loss of atonia.

2605043,[A case of multiple sclerosis with pure alexia].,"Shiota, J; Sugita, K; Kikushima, S; Maki, T; Takeuchi, T",Shiota,"We report here a case of multiple sclerosis (MS) showing pure alexia. The patient was a 28 year-old, right-handed male student of medicine. He had been healthy prior to college, but when he tried to read the newspaper one morning in January of 1983, he suddenly became aware that he could not. He could speak fluently and had no disturbances of auditory comprehension. No signs of abnormality were noted in his writing ability. Thereafter, the patient occasionally experienced difficulty in reading, together with right homonymous hemianopsia. These symptoms, however, usually vanished following sleep. In April, 1984, the patient experienced headache and ataxia when walking, followed by repeated remission and exacerbation of the symptoms. Corticosteroid therapy produced complete disappearance of the headache and ataxia. In September of 1985, he was hospitalized at our department due to the clouding of consciousness accompanied by convulsions. Neurologically, no abnormalities of the ocular fundus were noted and Babinski's sign was negative, but left hemiplegia was observed. Neuropsychologically, his intelligence was normal and he had no difficulty in writing, but paralexia was noted. There were no disorders of spontaneous speech or auditory comprehension. Examination by CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a number of lesions in the white substance of the cerebrum, including the left occipital lobe. The abnormal signs seen radiographically vanished when cortical hormones were administered. It has been thought that the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are due mainly to disorders of the white substance, and that MS seldom produces symptoms of aphasia, due to the fact that the lesions in this disease are generally small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

38819245,Cerebral Anoxia in an 18-year-old Patient Being Treated for Major Depressive Disorder: How Forensic Detective Work Uses Medical Knowledge Including Clinical Pharmacology to Solve Cases.,"Preskorn, Sheldon H; Masolak, David D",Preskorn,"This column is the first of a 3-part series illustrating the importance of medical knowledge, including clinical pharmacology, in a forensic context. This first case involved an 18-year-old high school student who suffered an anoxic brain injury and remained in a state of permanent decorticate posture, unresponsive except for grunts and primitive movements until he died several years later. Our investigation began by ruling out plausible causes that were suggested by the defense in the malpractice suit. Once those possibilities were eliminated, the focus was on what accounted for the damage to the patient using general medical knowledge and clinical pharmacology. The 4 Ds of forensic psychiatry (duty, damages, dereliction, and direct cause) are the 4 elements that the plaintiff is required to prove in civil court to prevail in a malpractice suit and are applied to this case with a special focus on dereliction and direct cause. This catastrophic outcome was due to 3 factors. First, the patient had physiologically significant dehydration to the point that he had developed a reflex tachycardia to maintain his blood pressure. Second, the patient had been switched from extended to immediate-release quetiapine, resulting in a doubling of the peak concentration of the drug, which produced higher occupancy of alpha-1 adrenergic, histamine-1, and dopamine-2 receptors, causing a further drop in his blood pressure as well as increased sedation and impairment of his gag reflex. These effects occurred quickly because of the faster absorption of the IR formulation of the drug. Third, the patient had gone to sleep in a reclining chair so that his brain was above his heart and his lower extremities were below his heart, resulting in an increased ""steal"" of cardiac output going to his brain. These 3 factors together led the patient to aspirate and suffer a hypoxic brain injury after an episode of vomitus. This column explains the process by which the cause of this sad outcome was determined, how it was related to a dereliction of duty to the patient, and how other proposed causes were ruled out.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of psychiatric practice,10.1097/PRA.0000000000000780,,,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

She showed a sleep-wake cycle, but no evidence of cognitive functioning. Six months after her illness, she began to respond to her environment and eventually returned home to the care of her parents, with regular periods of respite care in a home for people with severe physical disabilities. She remains in a wheelchair with a severe dysarthria and communicates via a letter board. Two years after her illness, staff at the home requested an assessment of her cognitive functioning. On the WAIS-R verbal scale and the Raven's Progressive Matrices, the woman's scores were in the normal range. So too were her recognition of real versus nonsense words and her memory functioning (apart from a visual recognition memory test which was in the impaired range). Although she enjoyed the tests, she became distressed when asked about her illness and previous hospitalization. She was reassessed 1 year later, when there were few significant changes in her test scores but she could talk about her illness and hospitalization without becoming distressed. She was angry, however, about her experiences in the first hospital. Further tests suggested good executive functioning. In short, this woman's cognitive functioning is in the normal range for most tasks assessed, despite a severe physical disability and dysarthria, and despite the fact that she was vegetative for 6 months. Although some recovery following 6 months of being vegetative/minimally conscious is not unknown, it is rare, particularly for those with non-traumatic injuries, and the majority of people similarly affected remain with significant cognitive deficits. This client has, by and large, made an almost complete cognitive recovery. She feels positive about her life now and says the formal assessment showed people she was not stupid and this made her happy.

RVI do not appear in the absence of the combat stress syndrome even in the presence of the other 3 factors. The sleep may be secondarily contaminated by wakefulness RVI.

The authors report an adolescent presenting with acute complete left-sided hemiplegia and sensory loss together with decreased tendon reflexes mimicking an acute arterial stroke. Examination revealed Hoover's sign was present and the patient was oblivious to his stern neurological state. Movement of his paralytic limbs was observed during sleep. Cortical and spinal CT, cortical MRI, motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and a PET study were all normal. As such, the diagnosis of psychogenic hemiplegia was established, apparently within a period that the patient had experienced severe emotional stress while questioning his gender identity. After three days, the adolescent began to move the paralytic limbs along gradual resolution of sensory deficit, leading to complete clinical recovering within two months. Although extremely rare, a conversion reaction should be taken into account in children presenting with acute hemiplegia and anaesthesia, even accompanied with decreased tendon reflexes, when the patient is oblivious to his alleged grave state, and when clinical observations such as Hoover's sign remain intact, substantiated by normal extensive radiological and neurophysiological investigation.
