35001065,Case Report: Visual Snow Syndrome after Repetitive Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Werner, Rachel N; Gustafson, Jennifer A",Werner,"Visual snow syndrome is a recently recognized condition with its own diagnostic criteria, evolving pathophysiologic research, and potential treatment options. This report documents a rare but likely underdiagnosed condition called visual snow syndrome. A review of the current literature on pathophysiology and treatments is discussed. A 40-year-old Whiteman started experiencing symptoms of constant pulsating pixels throughout his entire visual field approximately 3 weeks after a series of mild concussions. In addition, he experienced a persistence of images and photosensitivity. The patient had normal eye examination results, visual fields, and retinal imaging result. Brain MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, electroencephalography, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were unremarkable. A positron emission tomography scan demonstrated hypometabolism in the posterior parietal lobes and left posterior cingulate gyrus. Pharmacological treatment with antiepileptic and migraine medications was unsuccessful. Tinted lenses were essentially ineffective with a 10% reduction in symptoms reported with the use of a custom blue-tinted lens.Vision rehabilitation aids with optical character recognition were used for prolonged reading needs. Although rare, visual snow syndrome should be considered in all patients reporting continuous pixelations in their vision for more than 3 months, especially when accompanied by at least two of the following: photosensitivity, palinopsia, enhanced entopic phenomena, or nyctalopia. The pathophysiology is still unclear at this point, with evidence suggesting a link to the secondary visual cortex, specifically the lingual gyrus. More studies are needed to determine the exact cause, especially studies that separate visual snow syndrome patients with and without comorbid migraine. Because the pathophysiology is unclear, the treatment course is also unclear. Anecdotal evidence may suggest that tinted lenses may be of some value.",{},,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,10.1097/OPX.0000000000001862,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
31741679,Palinopsia Accompanied with Migraine Attack After Having Occipital Brain Abscess.,"Takayama, Yutaro; Iwata, Junya; Kojima, Akio",Takayama,"Palinopsia is defined as persistence of recurrent visual images after the stimulus has been removed. A 55-year-old male patient with long-standing migraine history developed brain abscess in the right occipital lobe. The patient developed episodes of palinopsia accompanied with migraine attack after healing of occipital lesion. The phenomenon cannot be sufficiently explained with single risk factor, although occipital lesion and migraine are both known to cause palinopsia. We speculated that migrainous brain is not always symptomatic but may drive cortex sensitive for second insult, such as occipital brain lesion. The predisposition may contribute to appearance of palinopsia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuro-ophthalmology (Aeolus Press),10.1080/01658107.2018.1519581,PMC6844513,Cortical irritability; migrainous brain; occipital lesion; recurrent visual images,Case Reports,England,eng

We measured palinoptic positive visual afterimages in a patient with a cerebral lesion.

Results showed that negative afterimages in the affected quadrant were no different from those in the unaffected quadrant. The positive afterimage in his affected field, however, differed both qualitatively and quantitatively from normal afterimages, being weaker but much more persistent, and displaced from the location of the inducing stimulus.

We describe here a case of palinopsia accompanied by a visual motion perception disorder as manifested by moving afterimages. A 71-year-old man presented to us after having experienced acute-onset, vivid, visual hallucinations for 1 week. A detailed history revealed that he was hallucinating multiple living and nonliving objects. He also complained of a persistence of afterimages, particularly in the left visual field. He reported that, on a few occasions, while sitting by the window in his room, he had seen a moving car on the road; immediately after the car had disappeared from his sight, he had then seen the same car moving backward at almost the same speed-as if the driver had applied the reverse gear. A neuropsychological assessment did not reveal any deficits in attention, language, or episodic memory. Visual field testing by confrontational perimetry suggested left hemianopia. An MRI of the brain revealed an arteriovenous malformation in the medial part of the right occipital lobe, affecting both the lingual gyrus and the inferior occipital gyrus. Palinopsia has generally been described in reference to static afterimages. In our case, not only was the afterimage that was perceived by the patient in motion, but the direction of the movement was also opposite to that of the actual object. We propose the term dyskinetopsic palinopsia, or simply motion-related palinopsia, for this particular condition.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000247,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The phenomenon has been investigated objectively with a simple procedure. The polyopia was highly correlated to movement of the eyes into the hemianoptic visual field and to increased contrast but not duration of the stimulus.

828866,Simple formed hallucinations confined to the area of a specific visual field defect.,"Lance, J W",Lance,"Thirteen patients with transient or permanent homonymous visual field defects experienced formed hallucinations localized to the affected part of the visual field. The lesion was occipital in 8 instances (infarction 7, porencephalic cyst 1), parietooccipital in 3 (infarction 2, angioma 1) and probably parietal in 2 (epilepsy 1, encephalitis 1). The disorder involved the right hemisphere in 9 cases, the left hemisphere in 3 cases and both hemispheres sequentially in one patient. Hallucinations were accompanied by palinopsia in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case. This particular type of hallucination is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes. Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects. There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story. In most cases, the hallucinations were not clearly related to any visual memory. It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative. The occurrence of such hallucinations with a visual field defect suggests that the cells of the association cortex are more likely to discharge spontaneously once they are deprived of their normal afferent inflow from the calcarine cortex.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/99.4.719,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Results from neuro-ophthalmic and neurological examinations were normal for the first two patients. The third patient presented abnormal visual fields with preserved visual acuity; electroencephalography was abnormal, suggesting an underlying toxic encephalopathy. Persistent visual illusions or hallucinations can occur during several months after an intake of cannabis. Flash-back phenomena are frequent amongst LSD abusers.

Their occurrence due to focal brain lesions is rare, most probably due to underreporting, which limits progress in understanding their underlying mechanisms and anatomical determinants. In this single case study, an 86-year-old patient experienced, in the context of an acute right central opercular ischemic stroke, visual hallucinatory symptoms (including palinopsia), differently lateralized auditory hallucinations and FOP. This unusual clinical constellation could be precisely documented and illustrated while still present, allowing a realistic and immersive visual experience validated by the patient. The acute stroke appeared to be their most plausible cause (after exclusion of other etiologies). Furthermore, accurate analysis of tractographic data suggested that disruption in the posterior bundle of the superior longitudinal fasciculus connecting the stroke lesion to the inferior parietal lobule was the anatomical substrate explaining the FOP and, indirectly, also hallucinations through whiter matter involvement, in coherence with existing literature. We could finally elaborate on symptoms taxonomy and phenomenology (e.g., polyopic heautoscopy, hallucinatory FOP, etc), and on patient's remarkable distancing from them (with some therapeutic implications supported by plausibly engaged mechanisms). This case not only authentically enriched the description of such rare combination of heterogenous illusory symptoms through this novel visualization-based reporting approach, but disclosed an unrevealed anatomo-clinical link relating all of them to the acute stroke lesion through an association fiber, thereby contributing to the understanding of these intriguing symptoms and their determinants.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.12.020,,Diffusion tensor imaging tractography; Feeling of a presence; Hallucination; Opercular stroke; Superior longitudinal fasciculus,Case Reports,Italy,eng

DAVMs are an infrequent cause of visual dysfunction that should be amenable to treatment if diagnosed before permanent visual field loss. The records of seven patients with cerebral visual disturbances associated with DAVMs were analyzed with attention to visual symptoms, visual field testing, and vascular anatomy. Sudden visual loss occurred in five patients, two with a hemorrhage and one with a venous infarct in the occipital lobe. Fortification images occurred in three patients, two of whom had palinopsia (one with de novo formed visual hallucinations). Homonymous quadrantic or hemianoptic field defects, some fluctuating, were found in six patients. Angiography revealed each DAVM was supplied solely by dural arteries and drained into occipital pial veins due to retrograde blood flow through the sites near or in the wall or lumen of the dural venous channels that normally drain the occipital lobe. Unlike DAVMs in other locations, only two patients had occlusion of an adjacent venous sinus. These patients, particularly the two with posterior fossa DAVMs remote to the occipital lobe, clearly demonstrate the visual and neurologic dysfunction resulting from venous hypertension. In six patients, intra-arterial embolization of the arterial feeders and nidus (one patient required additional surgery) resulted in resumption of normal occipital venous emptying. No further visual episodes occurred in five of these six patients. The visual fields normalized in three patients and improved in one with venous infarct but were unchanged in both patients with a hemorrhage. DAVMs that drain into occipital veins cause field loss and other visual disturbances because of venous hypertension in the occipital lobe, which can be reversed by occluding the DAVM nidus.

22258360,Acquired encephalopathy associated with carnitine deficiency after cefditoren pivoxil administration.,"Kim, Heyun; Chu, Kon; Jung, Keun-Hwa; Lee, Soon-Tae; Kim, Jeong-Min; Lee, Sang Kun",Kim,"We describe a 47-year-old woman who presented with palinopsia and subacute altered mental change after cefditoren pivoxil administration. The patient showed characteristic clinical manifestations of hypocarnitinemia, which affected her state of consciousness and she had radiologic findings that revealed metabolic encephalopathy with cytotoxic edema in the right occipital area and intracranial hemorrhages in right occipital and left frontal areas. Follow-up imaging after oral carnitine supplementation demonstrated complete resolution of the bilateral frontal subcortical T2 high-intensity lesions. Carnitine deficiency due to cefditoren pivoxil treatment may present as metabolic encephalopathy in adults. This possibility should be considered with the differential diagnosis of encephalopathies, and carnitine levels should be checked in patients treated with cefditoren pivoxil.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-012-0939-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
17987543,[Palinopsia following discontinuation of venlafaxine].,"Spindler, Peter Ernst",Spindler,"We report for the first time on a patient suffering from palinopsia after discontinuation of venlafaxine. Palinopsia is a rare and peculiar phenomenon which is defined as visual images that persist or recur after the stimulating object is removed and is often associated with posterior cerebral lesion or dysfunction. It also has been detected after usage of serotonergic drugs or in the course of antiserotonergic pharmacotherapy. Withdrawal symptoms after cessation of treatment involving serotonergic antidepressants are widely acknowledged in the literature, but still remain underestimated in clinical practice. It seems reasonable to suggest that clinicians should be aware of the risk of discontinuation symptoms in the case of serotonergic antidepressants, especially concerning those substances with a short half-life. If a decision is made to terminate therapy, it may be necessary to gradually reduce the dose over a number of weeks or to temporarily add a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with longer half-life.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Psychiatrische Praxis,10.1055/s-2007-986237,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger

11889834,[A case of visual perseveration attack caused by transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula].,"Nagata, T; Yamashita, Y; Hada, H; Sogabe, T",Nagata,"A case of visual perseveration attack in the right superior quadrantic visual field caused by left transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) was reported. A 75-year old right-handed man noticed that when he saw an object, the image sometimes persisted even after he looked away or the object was removed. The palinoptic images always appeared in the right superior quadrant visual field, consisted of a row of multiple objects all identical to the real one in shape, and were accompanied by photopsia. The palinoptic images disappeared within a few minutes. He was neurologically normal and showed no hemianopia or quadrantanopia on admission. EEG showed no epileptic discharge. CT scanning of the brain revealed a small high density area in the left occipital lobe. MRI demonstrated hyperintensity in the left inferior occipital lobe corresponding to the lower part of Brodmann's areas 18 and 19 on T2 weighted image and flow-voids caused by the dilated left occipital artery. 99mTc-ECD SPECT disclosed a decrease of regional cerebral blood flow in the left occipital lobe. Cerebral angiography revealed dural AVF fed by three branches of the left occipital artery and another branch of the left ascending pharyngeal artery with retrograde drainage into the left transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, and dilated cortical veins. The left transverse and sigmoid sinuses were occluded. Visual perseveration disappeared following the treatment of the dural AVF by transarterial embolization. Because the lesions on MRI and SPECT improved after the treatment, these lesions were considered to represent not infarction but vasogenic edema due to venous congestion. We emphasized the role of the left inferior occipital lesion including the secondary visual cortex (Brodmann's areas 18 and 19) as the cause of visual perseveration in the right superior quadrantic visual field.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

3580213,[A case of pseudoxanthoma elasticum showing various heteroptics due to infarction of right parieto-occipital lobe].,"Maeda, Y; Uchiyama, S; Soma, Y; Aikawa, T; Kobayashi, I; Maruyama, S",Maeda,"A case of pseudoxanthoma elasticum showing various heteroptics due to infarction of the right parieto-occipital lobe was reported. The patient was 48-year-old male. Angiography revealed an obstruction of the right internal carotid artery, aneurysmal dilation of the right posterior communicating artery, and obstructions of the right parieto-occipital artery and calcarine artery. A low density area was found in right occipital lobe by CT. MRI clearly identified lesions in the right cuneus and precuneus. Pseudopsia in the left homonymous quadrantanopsia, various types of visual illusion in the remaining visual field, and moreover, palinopsia were existed. Visual illusion was recognized in the early stage after the onset, while the pseudopsia was recognized about one month after the onset. Both abnormalities tended to improve from the peripheral region with the improvement of the defect in the visual field. Administration of phenytoin resulted in an improvement in the pseudopsia but it resulted in an aggravation in the visual illusion. Thus, the mechanisms of development of this phenomena were thought to be different from each other. It was found by dynamic CT that the blood flow in the primary visual cortex was rather increased in the affected site in comparison with that in the healthy site. It was speculated that the pseudopsia in the defective region of the visual field reflected a pathological repair process represented by a development of the collateral circulation. On the other hand, the visual illusion was thought to originate from visual unstability due to incomplete damage of the visual pathway at the affected site.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
7994991,[123I-IMP SPECT findings of visual perseveration in a patient with old hemorrhage in the right occipital lobe].,"Machii, K; Watanabe, Y; Narita, Y; Kuzuhara, S; Mezaki, T",Machii,"We report a case of visual presevertation in a 67-year-old man. He had been well until 66 years of age when he had brain hemorrhage in the right occipital lobe. After an operation for removal of the hematoma, visual hallucination occurred and persisted for about 6 months. One year and a half later, he had a convulsive seizure and diphenylhydantoin was started. During the two weeks following the convulsion, he several times experienced episodes of visual preservation, visual hallucination and metamorphopsia. MRI revealed an old hemorrhage in the right occipital lobe. 123I-IMP SPECT demonstrated increase of cerebral blood flow of the right medial occipital lobe one day after the episode of visual perseveration and decrease about three weeks after the episode. The mechanism which causes visual perseveration still remains to be clarified. The findings of 123I-IMP SPECT of the present case suggest that visual perseveration may be generated by postictal transient functional excitation of the right occipital lobe.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
