36596625,Dystonic posturing with athetoid movements in stroke without thalamic lesion.,"Ferreira, Axel; Carvalho, Vanessa; Coelho, Paulo Simões",Ferreira,"Complex hyperkinetic movement disorders are a rare complication of stroke, frequently involving posterolateral contralateral thalamic lesions. One of the proposed mechanisms for these presentations is proprioceptive impairment, hence not involving deregulation of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. We report a patient who presented with dystonic posturing and athetoid movements with onset 2 years after right frontoparietotemporal stroke. Brain MRI showed no thalamic lesion. Based on the phenomenology, a diagnosis of pseudochoreoathetosis was proposed. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of poststroke pseudochoreoathetosis without thalamic involvement.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2022-248977,PMC9815033,Movement disorders (other than Parkinsons); Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
37038583,Acute Onset of Movement Disorders Accompanying Common Emergency Room Neurologic Disease Processes.,"Chapman, Jennifer; Horowitz, Michael; Bond, Ronnie; Fry, Janae; Joesph, Christy; Al-Saghir, Yousef",Chapman,"Emergency departments (EDs) of hospitals accredited for trauma and/or comprehensive stroke care treat a large volume of high-acuity patients. In this fast-paced environment, the primary focus is appropriate triage, rapid stabilization, diagnosis, and acute intervention for life-threatening conditions such as cerebral vascular accident (CVA). However, this approach may result in subtle or atypical neurologic signs and symptoms being overlooked. Often, these oversights are innocuous in terms of their influence on overall patient outcomes. They are, in the vernacular, ""of academic interest only""<i>.</i> These cases provide ED clinicians with a unique opportunity to witness signs and symptoms not classically associated with common neurologic maladies. These unusual manifestations may be fleeting as they often either resolve with intervention or are overshadowed by progressive clinical decline. If such findings are recognized, they can at a minimum provide fascinating insights into neuroanatomic function. At a maximum, early recognition can influence immediate treatments and long-term outcomes. We report three ED patient presentations that shed light on functional neuroanatomical pathways and, in one case, significantly affected a patient's immediate algorithmic care. Two such cases involved acute middle cerebral artery distribution ischemic strokes, which typically present with focal contralateral sensorimotor and potential language deficits. Such events less commonly initially present with involuntary motor movements (dyskinesias). Failure to recognize these less common ictal signs may delay appropriate ED intervention or yield etiologic misdiagnoses. A third case involved a loss of consciousness ictal event secondary to a frontotemporal lobe tumor. This case presented with aphasic stroke-like symptoms along with new acute orofacial dyskinesias. Imaging before and after medical, surgical, and endovascular intervention provided important clinico-anatomic lessons. Furthermore, proposed neurophysiologic mechanisms and review of pertinent literature are provided.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.35924,PMC10082449,aphasia; athetosis; chorea; dyskinesia; hemiballismus; neoplasm; stroke; thrombectomy,Case Reports,United States,eng

The lesions, commonly unilateral, may result from hemorrhage due to vascular malformation, trauma, surgical intervention or hypertension, tumor, or ischemia. Bilateral cases are extremely rare. This condition is classically associated with development of palatal tremor, but clinical manifestations can include other involuntary movements. We describe 2 cases: unilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration in a 60-year-old man with contralateral athetosis and neurologic worsening developing several years after a pontine hemorrhage and bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration in a 77-year-old woman with development of palatal tremor, probably secondary to pontine ischemic lesions (small vessel disease).","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2014.09.036,,Hypertrophic olivary degeneration; athetosis; palatal tremor; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
31890704,Neuroradiological Evolution of Glycaemic Hemichorea-Hemiballism and the Possible Role of Brain Hypoperfusion.,"Marinelli, Lucio; Maggi, Davide; Trompetto, Carlo; Renzetti, Paolo",Marinelli,"Lateralized involuntary movements consistent with hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear following the development of contralateral haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). This condition is called vascular HCHB, but the same symptoms can be caused by a completely different striatal lesion. Glycaemic HCHB may occur in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia: basal ganglia hyperdensity is seen on brain CT, while increased T1 signal intensity and reduced susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and gradient-echo sequences (T2*-GRE) are detected on MRI. An 83-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia was admitted for ischaemic stroke presenting with dysarthria and mild left hemiparesis. No involuntary movements were reported at admission. The emergent brain CT scan was negative for vascular acute lesions, while a mild bilateral hyperdensity of the striata was detectable. Involuntary movements on the left side of the body, consistent with HCHB, appeared 27 days later. The alterations on brain CT completely disappeared after 3 months. On brain MRI, the T1 signal alterations resolved after 10 months, while SWI and T2*-GRE sequences showed persisting alterations after 2 years. Detailed brain imaging demonstrated evolution of striatal alterations of glycaemic HCHB before the appearance of involuntary movements and during the following 2 years. The association between ischaemic stroke and glycaemic HCHB favours the hypothesis that chronic hyperglycaemia more likely determines striatal alterations and the clinical picture of HCHB when vascular hypoperfusion also occurs. Hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia accompanied by typical neuroradiological features consisting of striatal alterations detectable on brain CT and MRI, often bilaterally.Unusually, striatal alterations can be detected before the appearance of involuntary movements and are fully reversible on brain CT and T1-MRI sequences.Brain hypoperfusion may facilitate the appearance of typical HCHB in patients with chronic hyperglycaemia.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,10.12890/2019_001257,PMC6886634,Hemichorea; athetosis; hemiballism; hyperglycemia; hypoperfusion,Case Reports,Italy,eng

Accordingly, thalamic strokes have rarely been associated with tremor, pseudo-athetosis and dystonic postures. We present a 75-year-old man who developed a disabling tremor 1 year after a posterolateral thalamic stroke. This tremor had low frequency (3-4 Hz), did not disappear on focus and was exacerbated by maintaining a static posture and on target pursuit, which made it very difficult to perform basic functions. MRI demonstrated an old ischemic lesion at the left posterolateral thalamus. Treatment with levodopa led to symptom control. Lesions in the midbrain, cerebellum and thalamus may cause Holmes' tremor. Delayed onset of symptoms is usually seen, sometimes appearing 2 years after the original injury. This may be due to maturation of a complex neuronal network, leading to slow dopaminergic denervation. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of this unique disconnection syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2015.09.014,,Holmes’ tremor; Movement disorders; Symptomatic tremor; Thalamic stroke; Thalamic tremor; Ventral posterolateral nucleus,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

The second patient presented with a psychosis and fever, developing severe dyskinesias involving the mouth, trunk and limbs, together with respiratory irregularities and presumed hypothalamic disturbance and disturbance of consciousness. In both cases, initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed an elevated white cell count (predominantly lymphocytes), elevated protein in case 2, and oligoclonal bands in both cases. Computed tomography (CT) brain scan was normal but in both cases EEG revealed diffuse slow wave activity. A 18F-Dopa positron emission tomography (PET) scan in case 2 was normal. The medical management of both patients is discussed. In case 1, L-Dopa improved the akinesia, while the myoclonus responded to clonazepam. In case 2, the severe dyskinesias failed to respond to a number of drugs, and she ultimately required paralysis to relieve her almost continuous movements.

22116988,Postthalamic stroke dystonic choreoathetosis responsive to tetrabenazine.,"Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore; Polimeni, Giovanni; Gervasi, Giuseppe; Bramanti, Placido",Calabrò,"To describe the case of a woman with poststroke choreoathetosis whose symptoms improved after treatment with tetrabenazine. A 48-year-old left-handed woman developed progressive involuntary dystonic choreoathetoid movements of her arm following a cerebrovascular event. Involuntary abnormal movements (IAMs) were treated with haloperidol, but they worsened 6 months later, also involving her mouth, tongue, and perioral area. Because of the suspected occurrence of drug-induced tardive dyskinesia, treatment was switched to tetrabenazine (titration up to 100 mg/daily), with rapid remission of the involuntary abnormal movements (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score switching from 20 to 1). One month later, following discontinuation of tetrabenazine, the dystonic choreoathetoid movements rapidly reappeared. Subsequent rechallenge with tetrabenazine caused remission of her symptoms. Poststroke IAMs are rare, and lesions involving the basal ganglia and/or thalamus seem to be particularly implicated in such disorders. The exact pathogenic mechanism has not been clarified; however, it has been postulated that a central dopaminergic overactivity might play an important role in the IAM occurrence. Thus, antipsychotics are the main treatment option, but they are often associated with therapeutic failure or adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic complications. Interestingly, when our patient was treated with tetrabenazine for haloperidol-induced tardive dyskinesia, she demonstrated substantial improvement in the dystonic choreoathetoid movements of her left upper limb. The improved response of this case to tetrabenazine monotherapy suggests that tetrabenazine may be a pharmacologic alternative for patients with poststroke choreoathetosis that is intolerant or unresponsive to antipsychotic agents. Further studies are needed to better define the risk versus benefit profile of tetrabenazine.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,10.1345/aph.1Q366,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

One patient had a parietal cortex injury, one had a thalamic infarction, two had spinal cord lesions, two had dorsal root ganglion neuronopathies, and one had an ulnar neuropathy. In each case, the duration of abnormal movements correlated with the duration of proprioceptive sensory loss, and the abnormal movements were restricted to body parts with proprioceptive sensory loss. The movements varied from chorea and athetosis to dystonia. These cases suggest that proprioceptive sensory loss can lead to a movement disorder, termed pseudochoreoathetosis, which occurs following the appearance of lesions anywhere along proprioceptive sensory pathways, from peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex. It is hypothesized that pseudochoreoathetosis occurs because of the failure to process limb proprioceptive information in the striatum.

A 57-year-old woman showed choreoathetosis in right upper and lower extremities, and mental aberration. Cranial CT scan showed high density areas in bilateral frontal lobes, right caudate nucleus and putamen, right vermis of cerebellum, left corpus callosum, all of which revealed increased high density by enhancement. The diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was confirmed by the findings of CT scan-guided stereotaxic biopsy. Although the consciousness became gradually drowsy, neurological signs and symptoms and cranial CT scan's findings were improved by radiation therapy. Subsequently, she developed paresis of left upper and bilateral lower extremities and died of sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation 8 months after the onset. Neuropathological examination revealed macroscopically atrophy and brawnish discoloration in bilateral caudate nuclei and right globus pallidus. Microscopically, there were invasions of tumor cells in the subependymal perivascular space of ventricles and subarachnoidal spaces of cerebellum and brainstem. The bilateral heads of caudate nuclei revealed severe atrophy, neuronal loss and astrocytic proliferation induced by tumor cell invasion into the head of caudate nuclei, of which body and tail were well preserved. The globus pallidus and putamen did not show any abnormalities on left side, but the right globus pallidus was atrophic, and middle part of putamen and globus pallidus showed tissue rarefaction, loss of myelin, and astrocytic proliferation. However, neuronal cells were relatively preserved. In the spinal cord, the tumor cells invaded to the subarachnoidal and perivascular spaces and necrosis of spinal parenchyma were noted from lower cervical to upper thoracic cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Following flu-like symptoms, the patient presented with confusion and generalized seizures. Subsequently, she developed persistent stupor with absence of the brainstem reflexes, refractory status epilepticus accompanied by hyperthermia, and exhibited choreoathetoid movements. Despite therapies her condition showed no improvement, and she died four months after the onset of disease. Postmortem examinations revealed no evidence suggestive of viral encephalitis, and instead distinctive bilateral lesions were seen in the subiculum (the subiculum proper and the prosubiculum) and the basolateral nuclear group of the amygdala. The hippocampus proper from CA1 to dentate fascia was unremarkable. The selective amygdalo-subicular degeneration, for which pathogenesis remained unknown, was inconsistent with her serious clinical condition.

These movement disorders disappeared when the drug was stopped and reappeared when the patient was challenged. Throughout the period of treatment, concentrations of phenytoin in serum were consistently low within the therapeutic range. Interfering symptoms from the cardiovascular system and the absence of some classic symptoms of phenytoin intoxication (nystagmus and dysarthria) contributed to delay the diagnosis. The patient died in hospital and autopsy of the brain showed rather localized encephalomalacies of corpus striatum. The pathogenic action of phenytoin and the role of preexisting brain lesions are discussed.

We report two patients with definite MS who acutely developed hand dystonia and athetoid movements. In both patients: 1) dystonia was electrophysiologically demonstrated by lack of reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic forearm muscles; 2) SEP from median nerve stimulation showed delayed cervical N13 and absent frontal and parietal components; 3) the long latency response after stimulation of median nerve of the affected hand was absent or delayed; 4) MRI showed lesions in the posterolateral cervical spine but no involvement of basal ganglia and thalami. We think that, in these cases, dystonia and athetoid movements could be ascribed respectively to the involvement of descending pathways regulating reciprocal inhibition of motoneurons and to the involvement of large diameter afferents due to the demyelinating lesion at the cervical level.",{},,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,10.1111/j.1600-0404.1994.tb02679.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Denmark,eng
8365063,[Bilateral abducens nerve palsy followed by pseudoathetosis due to pontine hemorrhage--clinical and neuroradiological study].,"Waragai, M; Iwabuchi, S; Niwa, N",Waragai,"Reported here are two cases with pontine hemorrhage presented with bilateral abducens nerve palsy and followed by pseudoathetosis, ataxia, and hemiparesis on the contralateral side of the lesion. The first case, a 57-year-old man, who suffered from bilateral abducens nerve palsy, deafness and hypoesthesia, ataxia, and hemiparesis of the right side of the body. MRI showed the confined lesion in the left side of tegmentum at the level of middle pons. When the abducens nerve palsy began to improve, pseudoathetosis of the right fingers appeared. About six months later, symptoms almost recovered, except for ataxia. The second case, a 48-year-old man who suffered from bilateral abducens nerve palsy, deafness of the left ear, and ataxia, hypoesthesia, and hemiparesis of the left side of the body was admitted. MRI disclosed a small lesion on the right side of the tegmentum at the level of middle pons. When the bilateral abducens nerve palsy was beginning to improve, pseudoathetosis of the left hand appeared. Three months later, pseudoathetosis of the left hand disappeared. Both patients presented here had a similar lesion in the tegmentum at the level of middle pons on the side contralateral to the side in which the pseudoathetosis was seen. Considering the clinical symptoms and radiological findings of these cases, it appears that a lesion which causes such rare neurological symptoms may involve the medial lemniscus, spinothalamic tract, lateral lemniscus, spinocerebellar fiber, and central tegmental tract at the tegmentum of the middle pons on the side contralateral to the cerebellar signs and pseudoathetosis.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

MR image of the brain 15 days after the onset revealed the low intensity in right posterior limb of internal capsule. The lesion was surrounded by thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus with enhancement by Gd-DTPA. Surface EMG revealed irregular grouped discharge in short duration and grouped discharge in long duration in the left upper extremity. Those features are compatible with one of choreoathetosis.

11987709,[Pseudochoreoathetosis as manifestation of cervical cord lesion. Case report].,"Fiszer, U; Cichy, S; Zaborski, J; Pastuszko, M; Członkowska, A",Fiszer,"The involuntary movements of choreoathetotic type are commonly regarded as a sign of basal ganglia lesion. However, such movements can also occur in pathological processes involving the cervical spinal cord. This condition is referred to as pseudochoreoathetosis. Involuntary movements can be related to lack of proper coordination between agonist and antagonist muscles, their simultaneous activation due to impairment of reciprocal inhibition. The characteristic feature of pseudochoreoathetosis is proprioceptive sensory loss. In this paper we present 4 patients who developed various involuntary limb movements in early stage of the disease. Lesions in the cervical spinal cord were confirmed by MRI. In case 1 the cause was astrocytoma, in cases 2 and 3--demyelination, in case 4 the precise character of the lesion could not be established. Pseudochoreoathetosis is a rare condition which often remains unrecognized. The presented cases emphasise the importance of early and correct diagnosis leading to proper therapeutical procedure.",{},,Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Poland,pol

To our knowledge, no other cases of acute athetosis related to TGB have been reported to date. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that involuntary movements were induced by an interaction between TGB and concomitant AEDs, in particular phenobarbital (PB), possibly by increasing GABAergic transmission. We hypothesize that the presence of a static encephalopathy may have influenced the kind of extrapyramidal side effect induced by TGB in our patient, leading to athetosis.",{},,Epilepsia,10.1111/j.1528-1167.2006.00530.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 50-year-old right-handed Japanese man with no family history of neurological disease or consanguinity was referred to our neurological unit because of paroxysmal involuntary movement of his right extremities. Physical examination findings were normal. Neurological examination during the interictal period revealed no abnormality. The attacks were triggered by abrupt initiation of voluntary movement and occurred about 30 times a day, lasting 30 to 60 seconds with no disturbance of consciousness. No metabolic abnormalities were found, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormality including lacunar infarction. Interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion of left basal ganglia. Interictal electroencephalography was normal without epileptic discharges. Because the patient did not have any condition that could cause secondary PKC, he was diagnosed as having idiopathic PKC. Treatment with carbamazepine 200 mg once a day resulted in control of the attacks, and 500 mg a day resulted complete resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this case may represent the oldest age reported for idiopathic PKC onset. Although the etiology of PKC remains unknown, late-onset idiopathic PKC is rare.
