24261211,[Catatonia in the elderly].,"Chiba, Yuhei; Odawara, Toshinari",Chiba,"Catatonia is a syndrome characterized by mutism, stupor, immobility, negativism, posturing, stereotypy, and echophenomena. Not only patients with schizophrenia, but also patients with general medical disease, mood disorder, and substance-related disorder exhibit catatonia. In the patients with catatonia, it is recommended to examine whether they have a general medical disease. We present two catatonic elder patients. Case 1 exhibited catatonia with vascular dementia, and was revealed to have anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. Case 2 exhibited catatonia with dementia with Lewy bodies, and was revealed to have Hashimoto's encephalopathy. The first recommended treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines. In case of benzodiazepine resistance or malignant catatonia, it should be considered electroconvulsive therapy, but it needs to be carefully implemented for elder patients.",{},,Nihon rinsho.

8419810,Asymmetric catalepsy after right hemisphere stroke.,"Saver, J L; Greenstein, P; Ronthal, M; Mesulam, M M",Saver,"We describe the appearance of left hemineglect and striking cataleptic posturing, more prominent in left-sided extremities, in a patient without psychiatric illness. Neuroimaging demonstrated a large posterior right hemisphere infarct involving the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, the insula, and caudate. Additional movement abnormalities that comprise the full catatonia syndrome were absent, including stereotypy, mannerisms, ambitendency, automatic obedience, mutism, negativism, and echopraxia. Catatonia has been reported to be produced by lesions of diverse etiology affecting the frontal lobe, limbic system, diencephalon, or basal ganglia. In these cases, catalepsy has been manifest only rarely, and motor signs that are present are generally bilateral. This case demonstrates that asymmetric catalepsy can be produced by right hemisphere stroke, and provides partial support for earlier clinical literature relating catalepsy and the parietal lobe.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.870080113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
19124190,New onset of idiopathic bilateral ear tics in an adult.,"Agrawal, Amit; Shrestha, Rabin",Agrawal,"Tic disorders are commonly considered to be childhood syndromes. Newly presenting tic disorders during adulthood are uncommon and mostly described in relation to an acquired brain lesion or as incidental tics, particularly in context with other neurological or psychiatric diseases. Tic disorder involving the ears is extremely uncommon with only few studies in English literature. In the present case, we describe an adult patient with new-onset idiopathic tics disorder involving both ears, causing social embarrassment. In addition, our patient had recent onset of the tics without any childhood or family history of tic disorders. The single most important component of management is an accurate diagnosis. At the same time, tics should be differentiated from other movement disorders such as chorea, stereotypy, and dystonias.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2008.11.014,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
19039696,Helping a man with multiple disabilities increase object-contact responses and reduce hand stereotypy via a microswitch cluster program.,"Lancioni, Giulio E; Singh, Nirbhay N; O'Reilly, Mark F; Sigafoos, Jeff; Didden, Robert; Smaldone, Angela; Oliva, Doretta",Lancioni,"People with profound and multiple disabilities often display aberrant behaviours (such as stereotypical movements) which can inhibit learning and lead to social stigmatisation. This study was designed to help a man with multiple disabilities increase his object-contact responses and reduce hand stereotypy (in this case, hand/wrist rotation). An A-B-A-B design with a 3-month post-intervention check was employed. At baseline, a combination of microswitches (or microswitch cluster) was used to monitor the man's object-contact responses and hand stereotypy. During the intervention phases and post-intervention check, the microswitch cluster was combined with preferred stimuli for object-contact responses occurring without hand stereotypy. The stimulation lasted for 8 seconds if the man remained free from hand stereotypy for that time, but was interrupted if the stereotypy appeared. The intervention showed an increase in object-contact responses occurring without hand stereotypy and a reduction in session time with hand stereotypy. These data were maintained at the 3-month post-intervention check. Replication of these findings with other individuals would confirm the utility of this type of intervention for increasing constructive responding and reducing stereotyped behaviours.",{},,Journal of intellectual & developmental disability,10.1080/13668250802441664,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
