33354461,Unusual Cause of Stroke.,"Borcheni, Mariem; Kandah, Emad; Abdelazeem, Basel; Alnaimat, Saed; Kunadi, Arvind",Borcheni,"Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke, the vast majority of which are ischemic. Cardiac myxoma is an unusual cause of stroke and accounts for less than 1% of ischemic strokes. We present a case of a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who presented with altered mental status, tinnitus, double vision, and diaphoresis. Due to concern for a cerebral vascular accident, a CT scan of the brain was obtained and showed no acute intracranial process. Brain MRI revealed multiple small acute infarcts involving bilateral posterior cerebral artery distribution. Further evaluation included transthoracic echocardiography that showed a large mobile mass in the left atrium measuring 3.5 x 2 cm intermittently projecting through the mitral valve. The patient underwent successful surgical resection of the left atrial mass. The pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of atrial myxoma. This case further highlights the importance of complete evaluation of stroke, including echocardiography, as well as the importance of careful surgical resection to prevent recurrence of systemic embolization and other complications of atrial myxoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.11517,PMC7746012,atrial myxoma; cardiac tumor; cardioembolic stroke; echocardiogram; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng
6437262,Neurinomas of the trigeminal nerve.,"Nager, G T",Nager,"Trigeminal neurinomas account for about 0.2 per cent of all intracranial tumors and for about 2 to 3 per cent of all intracranial neurinomas. Trigeminal neurinomas occur most frequently in persons in the middle decades of life, with the highest incidence between the ages of 38 and 40 years. They show no sex predilection. Although very rare, trigeminal neurinomas are of considerable interest to the neurotologist because of their relation to the temporal bone, skull base, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses, nasopharynx, infratemporal fossa, and, in rare instances, the oral cavity. In addition to producing disturbances of fifth nerve sensory and motor function, these tumors are often associated with other symptoms, such as occlusion of the eustachian tube (sensation of fullness and conductive hearing loss), otalgia, exophthalmos, paralysis of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, and signs of posterior fossa involvement (sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, cerebellar ataxia, and involvement of cranial nerves VII and IX through XI), any of which may be the initial clinical manifestation of the neurinoma.

37502643,Multiple Spontaneous Arteriovenous Fistulas of the Superficial Temporal Artery.,"Ueno, Kota; Shimamura, Norihito; Yanagiya, Keita; Katagai, Takeshi; Ohkuma, Hiroki",Ueno,Multiple spontaneous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) of the external carotid artery (ECA) are rare. We present a case of multiple spontaneous AVFs treated by coil embolization using a combination of the transarterial and transvenous approach. A 59-year-old woman complained of right pulsatile tinnitus and a mass lesion at the ventral region of the right ear. 3D CTA and cerebral angiography revealed two AVFs on the superficial temporal artery (STA) with an aneurysm 9.8 mm in diameter. A balloon guiding catheter was navigated to the right STA via the right femoral artery. Another balloon guiding catheter was navigated to the right external jugular vein. The STA distal to the aneurysm was embolized with platinum coils by a transvenous approach. The STA proximal to the aneurysm was embolized transarterially and draining veins were embolized transvenously. Her symptoms were cured after endovascular embolization. MRA at 1 day and 6 months postoperatively showed no recurrence of AVFs or aneurysm. Coil embolization of multiple spontaneous AVFs of the ECA using a combined transarterial and transvenous approach is a curable treatment option.

35261830,Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Aneurysm Mimicking a Vestibular Schwannoma.,"Benjamin, Tania; Jiam, Nicole T; Cooke, Daniel; Huang, Michael C; Sharon, Jeffrey D",Benjamin,"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysms are rare pathologies that may present with hearing loss, facial paralysis, vertigo, and tinnitus. Otologic symptoms at the time of presentation may prompt physicians to order an MRI, which can lead to the misdiagnosis of AICA aneurysms as vestibular schwannomas. We discuss the case of a 27-year-old female who presented with sudden-onset vertigo and right-sided hearing loss. She was found to have a right homogeneously enhancing internal auditory canal (IAC) mass abutting the vestibular nerve on post-gadolinium T1 MRI two hours after the presentation, which was initially diagnosed as a vestibular schwannoma. Serial T1 MRI highlighted the evolution of blood products within this mass by presenting as bright at two days and dark at two months after presentation. Profound ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss and absent vestibulocochlear function were confirmed on audiometry and vestibular testing, respectively. The diagnostic cerebral angiogram was complicated by an iatrogenic right mid-cervical vertebral artery dissection, and the patient ultimately underwent successful embolization two months after presentation with the resolution of all presenting symptoms except right-sided hearing loss. Early recognition and treatment of an AICA aneurysm may help prevent associated vascular complications, and they should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis for IAC lesions despite their rarity.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.21807,PMC8893281,aica; aneurysm; hearing loss; vertigo; vestibular schwannoma,Case Reports,United States,eng

MR images disclosed the swollen cerebellum and cauda equine, with contrast enhancement in both meninges and nerve roots. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed extremely high protein level. Tubercular meningitis was considered and anti-tuberculosis therapy was given for weeks but without relief. With progressive deterioration, the PCNSL was eventually presumed according to positive CSF cytology and exclusion of systemic involvement. However, the patient passed away within days. We then reviewed the current diagnostic methods of PCNSL. The biopsy, as the gold standard for PCNSL diagnosis, is not eligible for all patients suspected PCNSL.

28277225,Arteriovenous malformation of the external ear: a clinical assessment with a scoping review of the literature.,"Kim, Shin Hye; Han, Seung Hoon; Song, Yoonjae; Park, Chang Sik; Song, Jae-Jin",Kim,"Auricular Arteriovenous Malformation of the external ear is a rarely encountered disease; in particular, arteriovenous malformation arising from the auricle, with spontaneous bleeding, has seldom been reported. In the current study, we report an unusual case of late-onset auricular arteriovenous malformation originating from the posterior auricular artery that was confirmed by computed tomographic angiography. The case was successfully managed by pre-surgical intravascular embolization followed by total lesion excision. Prompted by this case, we also present a scoping review of the literature. A case of a 60 year-old man with right auricular arteriovenous malformation treated in our tertiary care center, and 52 patients with auricular arteriovenous malformation described in 10 case reports and a retrospective review are presented. Auricular arteriovenous malformation can manifest as swelling of the ear, pulsatile tinnitus, pain, and/or bleeding. On physical examination, a pulsatile swelling and/or a tender mass is evident. When arteriovenous malformation is suspected, the lesions should be visualized using imaging modalities that optimally detect vascular lesions, and managed via embolization, mass excision, or auricular resection. Effectiveness of the various diagnostic methods used and the treatment outcomes were analyzed. Various imaging modalities including Doppler sonography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and/or transfemoral cerebral angiography were used to diagnose 38 cases reported in the literature. In another 15 cases, no imaging was performed; treatment was determined solely by physical examination and auscultation. Of the total of 53 cases, 12 were not treated (their symptoms were merely observed) whereas 20 underwent therapeutic embolization. In total, 32 patients, including 1 patient who was not treated and 10 with persistent or aggravated arteriovenous malformation after previous embolization, underwent mass excision or auricular resection depending on the extent of the lesion. No major postoperative complication was recorded. The postoperative follow-up duration varied from 1 month to 19 years, and only one case of unresectable, residual cervicofacial arteriovenous malformation was recorded. Auricular arteriovenous malformation is a rarely encountered disease, but should be suspected if a patient presents with a swollen ear and pulsatile tinnitus. Appropriate imaging is essential for diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of disease. As embolization affords only relatively poor control, total surgical removal of the vascular mass is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brazilian journal of otorhinolaryngology,10.1016/j.bjorl.2016.09.004,PMC9449233,"Arteriovenous malformations; Ear; Embolization, therapeutic; Embolização, terapêutica; Malformações arteriovenosas; Orelha; Procedimentos cirúrgicos, operatórios; Surgical procedures, operative; Tinnitus; Zumbido",Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Brazil,eng

We conducted a retrospective case review. This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. A 50-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of neurologic symptoms, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and silent retinal artery occlusion. The patient underwent complete evaluation, including magnetic resonance image studies, audiometric tests, and retinal fluorescein angiography. She was treated initially with corticosteroids and later with other immunosuppressive agents. The patient was initially diagnosed with left sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Despite comprehensive clinical and laboratory studies that did not reveal systemic disease, 3 weeks later, the patient developed vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus in the opposite ear. The neurologic involvement and the bilateral audiologic manifestations raised the possibility of Susac syndrome. Susac syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown origin characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, fluctuating hearing loss, and visual loss resulting from microangiopathy of the brain, cochlea, and retina. The multiple organ involvement seen in Susac syndrome raises a differential diagnosis ranging from autoimmune disease, through systemic vasculitis, to multiple sclerosis.

There are few reports of complications associated with endovascular therapy. This report describes two cases of iatrogenic middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula due to vascular injury sustained during endovascular treatment. Case description Case 1 was that of a 46-year-old woman. She was treated for an incidentally discovered dural arteriovenous fistula of the cerebellar tentorium by transarterial embolization. During the procedure, a middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula occurred because of vessel laceration by the forced advancement of the distal access catheter (DAC). After the intervention, she developed tinnitus. Follow-up angiography revealed a middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was treated by coil embolization of the affected middle meningeal artery. The second case was that of a 56-year-old woman who developed a middle meningeal arteriovenous fistula from the perforation caused by the microguidewire during tumor embolization. The fistula was treated by occluding the proximal segment of the affected artery with coils. Both patients were discharged without neurological complications after the endovascular procedures.

Structural causes of reversible parkinsonism are exceptionally rare, but have been reported in association with deep cerebral venous thrombosis and dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). We now report a case of parkinsonian syndrome reversed by treatment of a dural arteriovenous malformation. Case report with retrospective review of relevant clinical, imaging, and treatment data. A 79-year-old man presented with complaints of a slowly progressive parkinsonian syndrome and tinnitus. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed numerous serpiginous flow voids highly suggestive of a vascular malformation. Cerebral angiography revealed a Cognard grade IIa + b left transverse sinus DAVF. The patient underwent combined endovascular and surgical treatment in three stages over a week's time, with total obliteration of the DAVF and complete normalization of his symptoms and neurological examination. Although rare, DAVF should always be considered as a potential cause of progressive parkinsonism.

After the procedure, the swelling had progressed further, leading to drooling of saliva and disabling tinnitus. When he presented to the emergency, local examination revealed a pulsatile neck swelling with peritonsillar mass. CT angiography/digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the neck and brain revealed a large aneurysm of the distal cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery (ICA).

We present the case of a 27-year-old male with 1.5 years of progressive headaches, tinnitus, imbalance and hearing loss. Imaging revealed a left Koos 4 acoustic neuroma. The patient underwent a retrosigmoid approach for resection. During surgery, a vein of significant size within the capsule of the tumor was encountered and was necessary to take to proceed with resection. After coagulation of the vein, intraoperative venous congestion with cerebellar edema and hemorrhagic infarction ensued, requiring resection of a portion of the cerebellum. Given the hemorrhagic nature of the tumor, continuing tumor resection was necessary to prevent postoperative hemorrhage. This was carried out until hemostasis was achieved. 85 % resection was achieved, leaving a residual against the brainstem and cisternal course of the facial nerve. Postoperatively, the patient required 5 weeks hospitalization followed by 1 month of rehabilitation. At discharge to rehabilitation, patient had trach, PEG, left House-Brackmann 5 facial weakness, left sided deafness, and right upper extremity hemiparesis (1/5). At 7 months follow up, he continued to have left House-Brackmann 5 facial weakness and left sided deafness but trach and PEG had been removed and strength had improved to 5/5. We demonstrate in this video the unfortunate and rare occurrence of intraoperative venous hemorrhagic infarction during acoustic neuroma resection - particularly for large tumors in young patients - and discuss its etiology and surgical steps that are necessary to partially remedy its devastating impact on the patient.

We encountered a patient with a scalp AVM that progressively enlarged over the course of 3 years by capturing feeders from intracranial arteries. To our knowledge, ours is the first serial angiographic depiction of the growth of a scalp AVM and the development of a de novo aneurysm in the superior temporal artery (STA) that performed as a feeder. This 21-year-old female consulted us in 1998 complaining of right tinnitus and a pulsating mass in the retroauricular region. The initial angiogram revealed an AVM in the right temporo-parietal subcutaneous space with feeders from the STA, an occipital artery, a posterior auricular artery, and a middle meningeal artery (MMA). Three years later, she complained of enlargement of the lesion, increased tinnitus, and alopecia. Repeat angiographic study revealed the presence of a nidus and the appearance of new feeders from a contralateral MMA and an ipsilateral middle cerebral artery; there was a de novo saccular aneurysm in the right STA. On the day preceding surgery, the left MMA was embolized to control intraoperative bleeding. The AVM was removed totally without any dermal complications. This case suggests that scalp AVMs can become enlarged by capturing subcutaneous or intracranial feeders, and that the consequent hemodynamic stress may induce de novo aneurysms in scalp AVMs. Capillary endothelial cells were strongly immunostained for vascular endothelial growth factor.",{},,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2003.09.033,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Retrospective clinical study and case report. A neuro-otology referral center at the university hospital in Bern, Switzerland, and a neurotologic practice in Geneva, Switzerland. Patients were selected from the hospital clinic and otolaryngologic practice registers. Among 8423 neurotologic checkups performed between 1988 and 1998, 432 (5.1%) patients had definite Menière's disease and 66 (15.3%) of these patients were > or = 65 years old. The files of these 66 patients were analyzed. Menière's disease in the elderly had 2 modes of presentation: reactivation of longstanding Menière's disease (40.9%) and de novo Menière's disease (59.1%), where the first dizzy spells, tinnitus, and hearing loss appeared after 65 years of age. Drop attacks occurred in 11.1 and 25.6% of the cases, respectively, and could be responsible for misdiagnosis of strokes of the brainstem. The patients were treated by mild antivertiginous drugs (betahistine, cinnarizine). Twenty-seven patients (41%) underwent surgery: transtympanic ventilation tubes (19 patients), sacculotomy (4 patients), vestibular neurectomy (3 patients), surgical labyrinthectomy (1 patient). The vertigo spells disappeared in 73.3 to 100% of the cases according to the type of surgery performed. Our study shows that Menière's disease in the elderly is not at all uncommon. It can appear as a de novo disease or as a reactivated longstanding disease. Drop attacks are more frequent than reported in general patient populations with Menière's disease and can mimic a stroke of the brainstem.

37350283,Anterior inferior cerebellar artery occlusion accompanied by hemorheology-documented increased blood viscosity: a case report.,"Chen, Yanyi; Li, Yuxin; Zhan, Tao",Chen,"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) occlusion is a subtype of posterior circulation stroke. Confirmation of its angiomorphology and etiology is challenging because of the complex mechanisms underlying small-artery thrombogenesis. In addition to conventional factors, physicians frequently overlook hemorheological changes. In this case report, we describe right AICA occlusion in a 50-year-old man. He presented with an unsteady walk, tinnitus, dizziness, and left-sided peripheral facial palsy observed over 36 hours, accompanied by increased blood viscosity on hemorheological evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere and middle cerebellar peduncles. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) failed to detect AICA occlusion, which was later confirmed using digital subtraction angiography. Repeat routine blood examinations showed elevated erythrocyte and leukocyte counts and serum hemoglobin concentrations that persisted over many days. Hemorheological evaluation revealed increased whole blood viscosity at a low shear rate. AICA occlusion should thus be diagnosed based on its initial characteristic manifestations; notably, MRA and CTA may fail to detect arterial occlusion. The importance of hemorheological change as a factor of stroke is frequently neglected.

However, few case reports have described DAVF discovered during pregnancy, and treatment strategies remain largely unknown.<b>Case description:</b> A 28-year-old primigravid woman without any medical history of note presented to our hospital for natural twin conception. She started to feel left-sided pulsatile tinnitus in 23 weeks of gestation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head raised suspicion of left cavernous sinus DAVF with leptomeningeal venous drainage. Considering the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage due to the increased cardiac output in the third trimester of a twin pregnancy, we performed transarterial embolization for the DAVF, which was successfully achieved without complications in 28 weeks of gestation. Tinnitus resolved immediately after the procedure, and the postoperative course proved uneventful. Both fetuses were safely delivered by cesarean section on 37 1/7 weeks of gestation. We encountered a case of cavernous sinus DAVF during a twin pregnancy. This case suggests that hemodynamic shift due to pregnancy has potential to cause higher shunt flow in an arteriovenous fistula. The timing of treatment should be determined in consideration of the hemodynamic change in the course of pregnancy. If X-ray exposures and iodine contrast media are appropriately managed, endovascular intervention is one treatment option, even during pregnancy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",10.1177/1591019921991396,PMC8493338,Dural arteriovenous fistula; neuroendovascular surgery; pregnancy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

A 41-year-old male patient symptomatic with persistent headaches and tinnitus underwent a retrosigmoid approach for a right cystic CPA tumor, presumed vestibular schwannoma. Intraoperatively, the facial nerve was identified as fine multiple strands splayed around the perimetry of the tumor, which elicited a motor response at a low threshold stimulation. This finding led to the intraoperative diagnosis of FNS according to the reported criteria.<sup>5</sup> Neuromonitoring-assisted fascicular-sparing resection technique was performed. It involved the gradual separation of the uninvolved nerve fibers using a fine-stimulating dissector at a threshold of 0.2 mA. Entry into the tumor was at a stimulation silent cyst. The tumor was debulked with preservation of the endoneurium and pulse irrigation hemostasis. A near-total resection was performed. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day with a House-Brackman III facial nerve deficit. The deficit remained stable during the following annual follow-up visits. Resection of CPA FNS is indicated at the earliest sign of deficit. However, it might be encountered as masquerading at the surgery of an acoustic tumor. The fascicular-sparing technique is critical in avoiding injuries to the endoneurium during the resection and with the ability to preserve function. The sparing of endoneurium avoids collagenization, fibrosis, and ischemia of the nerve, which are known to be the pathologic substrate of worse functional outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2023.02.042,,Cerebellopontine angle tumors; Facial nerve function; Facial nerve schwannoma; Fascicular-sparing technique; Neuromonitoring; Retrosigmoid approach,Case Reports; Video-Audio Media,United States,eng

Sixty percent were left-sided lesions, and three were bilateral. Hearing loss, dizziness, and tinnitus were the most common presenting symptoms. Surgical resection was performed in 52 (62%) of these lesions; however, total tumor removal was accomplished in only 17 (33%), which is most likely because of the fact that these tumors tend to have a poorly defined matrix and a dense adherence to neurovascular structures. Sixty-eight percent of patients experienced a new deficit postoperatively, 11% were unchanged, and only 19% improved with no new deficit. Only one documented case of tumor growth was identified; however, the reported follow-up was short (average, less than 3 years). With the magnetic resonance imaging techniques now available, lipomas can be reliably differentiated from other masses within the CPA and IAC, so histopathologic diagnosis is rarely necessary. Because of the potential for significant morbidity with resection of these lesions, we believe that conservative follow-up is the best treatment option for patients with these rare lesions.

Since an AVF is the most common life-threatening cause for pulsatile tinnitus (PT), meticulous evaluation and treatment of patients with PT is crucial. Here, we present two traumatic AVF cases treated with coil embolization leading to no residual fistulous connections followed by an immediate and complete resolution of PT. A 20-year-old man developed left ear tinnitus three months after a traumatic brain injury involving the right temporal bone fracture. Cerebral angiography demonstrated an enlarged left middle meningeal artery (MMA) and a fistular point at the posterior branch of the MMA draining to the middle meningeal vein (MMV) and the left pterygoid plexus, suggesting an AVF. Another 18-year-old girl developed left tinnitus, left exophthalmos, and conjunctival injection 6 months after a traffic accident involving no demonstrable abnormal findings in the radiologic exam. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated a markedly dilated left MMA draining to the MMV, left cavernous sinus, and left superior ophthalmic vein. In both cases, coil embolization was performed with total obliteration of the fistular point.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,10.3340/jkns.2019.0233,PMC7365271,Arteriovenous fistula; Embolization; Meningeal artery; Tinnitus,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

A 60-year-old man presented with pulsatile tinnitus and right facial nerve palsy. Radiological imaging showed a large homogenously enhanced osteolytic lesion at the right jugular foramen. A cerebral angiogram showed a high-flow vascular lesion of the jugular bulb associated with retrograde sinus reflux, resulting in venous congestion of the deep venous system. These findings led us to misdiagnose this lesion as a glomus jugular tumor. However, combined arterial and venous angiography after transarterial embolization revealed the precise angioarchitecture, and we finally diagnosed this lesion as a high-flow osseous AVF at the jugular bulb. We performed transvenous embolization using a triple catheter technique. The lesion was successfully obliterated, and the 6-months angiogram showed no recurrence. A rare case of high flow osseous AVF at the jugular bulb associated with osteolytic changes in the surrounding bony structure is reported. Although many hypervascular lesions at the jugular bulb are glomus tumors, bone destructive osseous AVF at the jugular bulb should be considered.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neuro-Chirurgie,10.1016/j.neuchi.2021.09.003,,Bone destruction; Glomus jugular tumor; Jugular bulb; Osseous arteriovenous fistula; Osteolytic,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,eng
1633481,Intracerebral hemorrhage due to dural arteriovenous malformations and fistulae.,"King, W A; Martin, N A",King,"Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most devastating complication of dural AVMs. The lesions most at risk are those located at the tentorial incisura and in the anterior cranial fossa. The more common dural AVMs located at the transverse-sigmoid sinus and cavernous sinus typically do not hemorrhage and more frequently present with insidious symptoms such as a cranial bruit, tinnitus, or headache. Angiographic appearance of pial draining veins or an intervening varix identifies those patients most at risk for bleeding. An aggressive clinical stance must be taken in this group of patients, with the goal being complete extirpation of the lesion, because any residual AVM can enlarge and recruit pial veins, thus increasing the chances of future hemorrhage. Hemorrhage, which frequently is massive, can be spontaneous or occur after endovascular embolization. When hemorrhage does occur, medical and surgical management must be immediately instituted to avoid secondary brain injury. Therapeutic options include surgery and embolization using particulate material or polymerizing glues, alone or in combination. Although surgery remains the most effective and versatile method for treating dural AVMs, endovascular therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery will likely play more significant roles in treating these lesions in the future.",{},,Neurosurgery clinics of North America,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

CCFs may pose diagnostic and management pitfalls for clinicians as they can initially be misdiagnosed as primary orbital pathology or nonarteriovenous shunting-related cavernous sinus pathology. Furthermore, the resolution of pulsatile tinnitus could be an ominous sign in patients with untreated dural arteriovenous fistula. We describe a case of a 56-year-old male who presented with progressive right eye proptosis, congestion, decreased visual acuity, limited duction, exophthalmos, and pulsatile tinnitus. The patient had poor response to antibiotics and steroids. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed significant inflammation involving the right orbit and atypical enhancement of the basal frontal lobe adjacent to the orbit. Cerebral angiography revealed an indirect right CCF and right sigmoid sinus thrombosis with stenosis of the right internal jugular vein. No clear predisposing factor was identified. Given the rapidly progressive nature of the condition, the patient successfully underwent endovascular treatment with transvenous approach to preserve flow in the internal carotid artery while ensuring occlusion of the fistula. A triad of proptosis, eye congestion, and signs of turbulent flow such as tinnitus or orbital bruit should raise suspicion for CCF. An interesting feature in this patient is that CCF may have occurred secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis with accompanying small cortical vein drainage. Our case highlights the importance of early recognition and timely intervention to ensure the resolution of orbital hypertension-related symptoms in rare cases of CCFs.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain circulation,10.4103/bc.bc_64_22,PMC10158662,Carotid cavernous fistula; embolization; ophthalmoplegia,Case Reports,India,eng

He suffered from a sleep disorder caused by tinnitus, and a discomfort with the lesion itself; therefore, we decided to surgically remove the lesion. To suppress intraoperative bleeding and safely perform the surgery, preoperative embolization was also planned. After treatment, he had no neurologic deficits and the sleep disorder improved. Perfusion CT scan performed after the surgery showed an improvement in cerebral blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere.

A local cause of sudden visual loss was excluded by clinical examination, cerebral bleeding was excluded by CT scan, vascular spasms and occlusions were excluded by CT angiography and acute infarction over the bilateral parieto-occipital cortex was excluded by MRI. The CT scan did, however, show contrast enhancement in the visual cortex from the contrast given during the previously performed cerebral angiography. The patient's vision spontaneously recovered within six days after the angiography, with no residual neurological deficits in her subsequent clinical follow up. Surgery was later performed on her dural arteriovenous fistula, which successfully treated the pulsatile tinnitus.

Most previous reports of MCP infarction have not been clear whether the patient's hearing impairment is localized to the center or periphery. We report 44-year-old man with vertigo, tinnitus, and bilateral sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) as the first symptoms. Pure Tone Audiogram revealed complete hearing loss in both ears. Acute bilateral MCP infarction was diagnosed by repeated brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) and the electrocochleography were normal. The otoacoustic emissions showed binaural cochlear dysfunctions. After the antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the pure-tone average (PTA) showed a clear improvement with 67 decibels (dB) on the right and 73 dB on the left at the 3-month follow-up. Vertebrobasilar diseases due to atherosclerosis should be routinely considered in middle-aged and elderly patients with vascular risk factors and bilateral hearing loss. Bilateral SSNHL can be a prodrome of acute MCP infarction and it can be peripheral. Brain MRI, brain magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), brain and neck computed tomography angiography (CTA), BAEP, otoacoustic emissions, and Pure Tone Audiogram help to localize and qualify the diagnosis.

Detailed evaluation of vascular structures can identify shunt pouches at the jugular tubercle venous complex (JTVC) in the bone near the hypoglossal canal. Although the JTVC has several venous connections, including the hypoglossal canal, there have been no reports of transvenous embolization (TVE) of a dAVF at the JTVC using an approach route other than the hypoglossal canal. This report describes the first case of complete occlusion with targeted TVE using an alternative approach route in a 70-year-old woman presenting with tinnitus diagnosed with dAVF at the JTVC. The patient had no history of head trauma or other preexisting conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormal findings in the brain parenchyma. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a dAVF near the ACC. The shunt pouch was located in the JTVC, near the left hypoglossal canal, with feeders from the bilateral ascending pharyngeal arteries and occipital arteries, left meningohypophyseal trunk, and odontoid arch of the left vertebral artery. TVE was performed near the shunt pouch. Localized packing of the shunt point was achieved. The patient's tinnitus improved. Postoperative MRI showed disappearance of the shunt without any complications. No recurrence was observed on MRA 6 months after treatment.

Intraoperatively, a glossy-grayish, intensively bleeding tumor without any capsule or delineation to the brainstem or cranial nerves was resected using electrophysiologic monitoring. Postoperative histology revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. Three months postoperatively, hearing was preserved (pure tone average-35 dB) and ataxia was equal to what it was preoperatively, gradually becoming better. Postoperative magnetic resonance scans demonstrated a complete resection of the tumor with completely restored brainstem contours.

To illustrate the endovascular treatment of scalp AVM <i>via</i> direct percutaneous puncture while traditional arterial and venous approaches were not available. In this report, access was obtained through a direct puncture of the enlarged frontal vein. Onyx-18 was injected through a microcatheter to occlude draining veins, fistulous connection, and the feeders. An 18-gauge indwelling needle was inserted into draining veins directly. Postembolization angiography demonstrated complete sAVM occlusion immediately and no non-targeted embolization. At a 1-year follow-up, no procedure-related complications and evidence of recurrence were observed.

The patient underwent surgical management through embolization of the AVM from the afferents of the dural arteries, which has resulted in positive clinical outcomes. However, this approach may not be suitable for all cases, and a multidisciplinary team approach may be required to develop an individualized treatment strategy.

MRI demonstrated two separate brain dural arteriovenous fistulas (bdAVF) in sagittal and right sigmoid dural sinuses. Neuro-ophthalmological exam demonstrated severe bilateral optic disc edema with preserved visual acuity but early nerve fiber bundle defects on visual field testing. Hypercoagulable profile testing revealed very elevated D-dimer, significantly decreased protein S level and elevated homocysteine levels. This case highlights importance of referring all patients with bdAVFs for neuro-ophthalmological consultation as venous hypertension can cause increased intracranial pressure and resultant papilledema. Papilledema does not affect central vision until late stages when visual loss is irreversible thus screening for its presence and pre-treatment extent of peripheral visual loss is paramount. It also demonstrates that hypercoagulable workup should be initiated in all patients with bdAVF in order to prevent future thromboembolic events.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",10.1177/15910199221098215,PMC10956462,dural arteriovenous fistula; hypercoagulation; papilledema,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

There remains a paucity of data to guide management decisions of intraspinal dissemination of HPCs in the literature, and none specifically related to anaplastic HPCs. We report a case of a 34-year-old woman with locally and distantly recurrent anaplastic HPC (World Health Organization grade III). She initially presented with tinnitus in her right ear. A well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing lesion was identified in the right cerebellopontine angle. Treatment consisted of subtotal resection and postoperative radiation therapy (RT) to a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. After a 3-year disease-free interval, 7 lesions recurred intra- and extracranially. The extracranial lesions were drop metastases of the original HPC through the cerebrospinal fluid into the spinal canal. Of note, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography scan was not sensitive enough to detect these new lesions. The intracranial recurrence was on the edge of the prior radiotherapy field, representing a marginal failure having received less than 50 Gy. The intracranial recurrences were treated with salvage gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with local control. She underwent intradural extramedullary hemilaminectomy of a thoracic spine metastasis followed by fractionated proton beam therapy (PBT) with a boost to unresected lesions. Within a few months of PBT, she became pregnant. Pregnancy did not affect recurrence or ameliorate tumor growth.

We report a rare osteoma with falx attachment. A 64-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of intermittent tinnitus and dizziness. The scout film of petrous bone computed tomography scan revealed a high-density lesion in the frontal area. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 2.5-cm mass attached to the surface of the falx in the right frontal parasagittal area. The patient underwent right frontal craniotomy, and a bony hard mass was found located in the right frontal parasagittal region extra-axially, with its medial surface attached to the falx. It could not be broken down by the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator or even the cutting loop and was detached from the falx and removed in one piece. Histopathological examination showed a nodule with bony trabeculae and bone marrow tissue, compatible with osteoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital with no neurological deficits one week after operation. This is the first case report in the English literature of an intracranial osteoma arising from the falx.

Today, detachable latex balloons are phased out or withdrawn from several markets. Acrylic glue is a proven stable material used for embolization of arteriovenous shunts. It is a precise, fast, and cost-effective method of endovascular embolization, and it does not cause artifacts on MRI or MRA. We treated nine patients suffering from direct fistulas with acrylic glue without any permanent neurological adverse events. Four patients were treated with glue embolization of the fistula without occlusion of the parent artery. Five patients with long-lasting symptomatology, large tears in the ICA, and with full collateral cerebral circulation were treated with glue embolization of the fistula and sacrifice of the ICA antero- and retrograde via the ICA and the posterior communicating artery.

Venous stenting has become a debated topic for correction of this pathology. A 49-year-old male merchant with bilateral IJVS presented with headache, dizziness, and pulsatile tinnitus. He was found to have intracranial hypertension and left IJVS caused by styloid process compression and right IJVS caused by damage of the venous intima. His symptoms improved after undergoing styloidectomy followed by left intra-internal jugular vein (IJV) balloon. However, 1 year later, the prior symptoms reoccurred. At this time, the patient underwent right intra-IJV stenting. After treatment of the contralateral side, the symptoms resolved during the following 3 months. The clinical practice in this case indicated that in patients with bilateral IJVS, a 2-side intervention may be necessary when unilateral correction fails.

The clinical presentation of LCH is heterogeneous and can manifest as single or multiple osteolytic lesions, skin ulcerations, and involvement of single or multiple systems. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is reported in 3.4-57% of patients with multisystem disease. In this article, we present the case of a young man with single system involvement (bone) of LCH who presented with seizures, headache, papilledema, and tinnitus. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain findings were reported as a normal study. The subtle signs of CNS involvement were missed by the radiologist. However, the high index of suspicion resulted in early diagnosis and treatment. The presence of empty sella turcica in neuroimaging could be the first sign of intracranial disease with chronic intracranial hypertension associated with LCH. This is especially correct if previous computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was normal with normal appearance of the pituitary gland and the sella. Neuroimaging films should be reviewed by an expert neuroradiologist. In patients with new neurological symptoms who were diagnosed previously with LCH, intracranial disease has to be excluded. The workup in such case should include an MRI of the brain, CT of the brain and temporal bones, bone scan, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, ophthalmological assessment, and measurement of intracranial pressure. In patients with LCH who present with symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure, the term idiopathic intracranial hypertension should not be applied until an intracranial disease has been excluded totally.

A dural attachment was not seen at the tentorium or posterior surface of the petrous pyramid. The tumor was firmly adherent to the superior petrosal vein. The origin site was cauterized and resected with the preservation of the superior petrosal vein. A diagnosis of meningothelial meningioma was made. The patient's headache and tinnitus gradually disappeared, and a recurrence was not observed five years after the surgery. The rare occurrence of meningioma without dural attachment makes it difficult to determine dural attachment before surgery. The absence of dural attachment makes it easy to completely resect such tumors. Vessels related to tumors should be removed carefully, considering the possible presence of tumor stem cells in the microvessels.",{},,World journal of clinical cases,10.12998/wjcc.v12.i17.3156,PMC11185388,Case report; Dura mater; Meningioma; Superior petrosal vein; Tumor stem cell,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Four patients with DAVFs at the petrous apex are presented. One patient was admitted with cerebral hemorrhage from a second occipital DAVF, and three patients had cranial nerve palsies. All fistulas were type III or IV according to Cognard's classification with venous drainage into the deep cerebral veins. Transarterial embolization was performed in two patients. Partial transarterial embolization was possible resulting in a marked flow reduction. In one further patient, surgical treatment via a subtemporal approach was attempted, but complete obliteration of the fistula was impossible. In all patients, complete occlusion of the DAVF was achieved by surgical interruption via a standard retrosigmoid approach to the cerebellopontine angle. Treatment of these type III or IV DAVFs was indicated. The fistulas were supplied by multiple meningeal feeders originating from the external and internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Preoperative transarterial embolization resulted in significant flow reduction. Complete cure at low risk was achieved by interruption of the venous drainage via a retrosigmoid approach.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2011.07.009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
37501892,A Case of Direct Carotid-Cavernous Fistulae Successfully Treated by Bidirectional Double Catheter Technique: A Technical Note.,"Hamano, Eika; Satow, Tetsu; Hori, Takamitsu; Takahashi, Jun C; Kataoka, Hiroharu",Hamano,"Ruptured carotid-cavernous aneurysms (CCAs) are known to result in direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). Although endovascular treatment is recognized as the first-line treatment for direct CCF, obliteration is sometimes difficult because of the high-flow shunt. In this report, we present a case of a direct CCF treated by the combination of transarterial and transvenous approaches. A 57-year-old woman presented with conjunctival chemosis, exophthalmos, and tinnitus. Ophthalmological examination revealed increased intraocular pressure. DSA demonstrated a direct CCF due to a right ruptured CCA with retrograde shunted flow through the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV), superficial middle cerebral vein, basal vein of Rosenthal, and middle temporal vein. Two microcatheters were guided into the shunt segment from the internal carotid artery and SOV. In addition, a balloon catheter was placed at the neck of the aneurysm to assist coiling. Coil embolization for the CCF was performed using two microcatheters in the opposite direction, which enabled compact and tight packing of the shunt segment with only six coils. The CCF was eliminated. Two-year-follow-up MRA revealed no recurrence. The bidirectional double catheter technique is a useful approach to obliterate a shunt in a short segment with minimal coils.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuroendovascular therapy,10.5797/jnet.cr.2021-0052,PMC10370543,direct carotid-cavernous fistula; transarterial embolization; transvenous embolization,Case Reports,Japan,eng

A 76-year-old woman presented at our hospital with tinnitus. Although MRI did not reveal the cause of her tinnitus, it did uncover an incidental finding of basilar artery stenosis. The patient reported a history of cerebral infarction, diabetes, and hypertension. Six years following the initial discovery of basilar artery stenosis, a saccular aneurysm was detected at the bifurcation of the basilar artery and the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery, corresponding to the distal portion of the basilar artery stenosis. Upon revelation of an enlarged aneurysm on the subsequent two-year follow-up MRI, the patient received coil embolization treatment. No signs of recurrence were observed on the next two-year follow-up MRI. It was assumed that proximal basilar artery arteriosclerotic stenosis had caused hemodynamic stress on the distal vessel wall, and that this was responsible for the formation and growth of a de novo aneurysm. This case suggests that cerebrovascular arteriosclerotic changes may be associated with de novo aneurysm formation and therefore requires careful follow-up.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuroendovascular therapy,10.5797/jnet.cr.2021-0036,PMC10370913,arteriosclerotic stenosis; de novo aneurysm; hemodynamics; wall shear stress,Case Reports,Japan,eng

Because of a high incidence of hemorrhage and subsequent neurological deficits, treatment is mandatory. A consecutive series of nine surgically treated patients with symptomatic tentorial DAVF were analyzed in this study. All lesions were located around the tentorial incisura and were treated microsurgically using a subtemporal approach in eight cases and a supracerebellar approach in one case. The dural bases of the lesions were located adjacent to the tentorial edge in six patients and the tentorial apex in three patients. Complete obliteration was achieved in all treated tentorial DAVF. In one patient, the torcular fistula remained untreated without cortical venous reflux. Postoperative asymptomatic temporal lobe hemorrhage was diagnosed in one patient with a tentorial apex DAVF; however, no new neurological symptoms were present after surgical treatment. The subtemporal approach for unilateral tentorial DAVF is a favorable and direct approach for the highly skilled surgeon. Perimesencephalic venous dilatation or varix is an important finding on MRI to help localize tentorial DAVF in the tentorial edge or apex.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-013-0448-z,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

MRI showed a vascular lesion in the left internal auditory canal (IAC). Angiogram showed a vascular lesion filling from the ascending pharyngeal and anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) with drainage into the sigmoid sinus suggestive of either a dural arteriovenous malformation (dAVF) vs arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the IAC. The decision was made to operate to prevent risk of future hemorrhage [1-5]. Endovascular options were not as ideal given access transarterially through the AICA would be risky, access transvenously would be difficult and it was unclear whether this lesion was a dAVF or AVM. The patient underwent a retrosigmoid approach. A tuft of arterialized vessels surrounding CN7/8 was identified and no true nidus was found so it was thought that this lesion was a dAVF. The plan was to clip the arterialized vein as is normally done for dAVF. However, there was engorgement of the vascular lesion upon clipping of the arterialized vein indicating risk of rupture if the clip was left insitu. It was too risky to drill the posterior wall of the IAC to expose the fistulous point more proximally. As a result, 2 clips were placed on the AICA branches. Postoperative angiogram showed some slowing of the vascular lesion but it was still present. Given the AICA feeder, it was decided that this lesion was a dAVF with mixed features of an AVM and the decision was made to gamma knife the lesion 3 months postoperatively. Patient underwent gamma knife targeting the dura superior to the IAC with 18 Gy at the 50 % isodose line. At 2 years follow up, the patient's symptoms improved and he remained neurologically intact.

Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) are a rare type of acquired intracranial vascular malformation whose symptoms mimic inner ear disease, but what distinguishes it from other tinnitus is the characteristic of DAVF is pulsatile and heartbeat-synchronous. We present a 58-year-old male with chronic left-sided pulsatile tinnitus (PT) for 30 years and continuous vertigo for 3 years that took numerous consultations to establish a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms. Delay in diagnosis is caused by normal magnetic resonance imaging and an unrecognized subtle mass in the left temporal region by time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) at the screening test. As we know, TOF-MRA could not provide a clear picture to establish a slow-flow DAVF. Cerebral angiography, a gold standard diagnostic, revealed a Borden/ Cognard Type I single slow-flow DAVF in the left temporal region.

Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed severe stenoses at bilateral sigmoid-transverse sinus conjunctions, and thus, the patient underwent intravenous stenting finally. Her aforementioned symptoms significantly attenuated after venous stenting and even disappeared gradually at 3-month, 6-month and 1-year follow-up.

Although the pathogenesis of dAVF is unclear, a link to cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has been posited though not fully identified. The current case is the first report demonstrating dAVF formation following CVT according to dynamic changes in the intracranial pressure and venous drainage pattern. This observation provides insight into the pathophysiological association between dAVF and CVT. A 60-year-old woman presented with acute onset of a severe headache and first-onset seizure. Initial magnetic resonance imaging showed an extensive thrombosis in the cerebral venous sinuses. However, there was no evidence of any vascular malformation. Eight months later, she reported dizziness, visual obscurations and pulsatile tinnitus. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography showed multiple dAVFs. Endovascular treatments for the dAVF embolization was performed twice, resulting in the obliteration of the dAVF along with the resolution of her optic disc edema, visual obscurations and tinnitus. The degree and pattern of the venous pressure, not hypoxia-induced growth factors, are the key pathogenic mechanisms of dAVF following CVT. Oral anticoagulants and good adherence do not ensure the prevention of dAVF.

Although rare, DAVFs can represent a potentially reversible cause of dementia. Bilateral white matter changes can be detected on the magnetic resonance imaging of patients with DAVFs. Familiarity with symptoms of DAVFs can reduce the incidence of misdiagnosis of dementia syndrome. This study aimed to explore the clinical manifestation, imaging characteristics, and prognosis of dementia with bilateral white matter changes caused by DAVFs. A 56-year-old man presented with memory deterioration, tinnitus, and weakness in both lower limbs for over 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed white matter signal changes in the bilateral ventricles and centrum semiovale, which manifested as low signal on T1-weighted imaging, high signal on T2-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging. Digital subtraction angiography revealed DAVFs along the lateral sinus. The patients' condition improved significantly after endovascular embolization of the DAVFs. DAVFs presenting with dementia are rare and cases with bilateral white matter alterations can be easily misdiagnosed as other diseases. If the patient has dementia and bilateral alterations in the white matter, a DAVF should be considered. This type of dementia is reversible and may be associated with venous hypertension caused by arteriovenous fistulas.

Acoustic neurinoma is the most common tumor in this location, which often causes hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus. Occasionally, this tumor compresses the brainstem, prompting surgical resection. Lipomas in this area may cause symptoms similar to neurinoma. However, they are not considered for surgical treatment because their removal may result in several additional deficits. Conservative therapy and repeated magnetic resonance imaging examinations for CPA/IAC lipomas are standard measures for preserving cranial nerve function. Herein, we report a case of acoustic neurinoma and CPA lipoma occurring in close proximity to each other ipsilaterally. The main symptom was hearing loss without facial nerve paralysis. Therefore, facial nerve injury had to be avoided.

It is essential to pay great attention to the entire procedure to avoid these complications. To report the complications of cranial nerve surgery via the retrosigmoid approach. We reviewed 516 cases of cranial nerve surgery via the retrosigmoid approach for HFS, TN and GPN. There were 208 cases of HFS, of which 117 cases underwent FNS alone and 91 cases underwent combined MVD and FNS. There were 273 cases of TN treated by MVD and selective neurectomy. There were 35 cases of GPN treated by neurectomy. Of the cases with complications, two (0.4%) died.

20420335,Fluid dynamics vascular theory of brain and inner-ear function in traumatic brain injury: a translational hypothesis for diagnosis and treatment.,"Shulman, Abraham; Strashun, Arnold M",Shulman,"It is hypothesized that in all traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with a clinical history of closed or penetrating head injury, the initial head trauma is associated with a vibratory sensation and noise exposure, with resultant alteration in vascular supply to the structures and contents of the fluid compartments of brain and ear (i.e., the fluid dynamics vascular theory of brain-inner-ear function [FDVTBE]). The primary etiology-head trauma-results in an initial fluctuation, interference, or interaction in the normal fluid dynamics between brain and labyrinth of the inner ear, with a resultant clinical diversity of complaints varying in time of onset and severity. Normal function of the brain and ear is a reflection of a normal state of homeostasis between the fluid compartments in the brain of cerebrospinal fluid and perilymph-endolymph in the labyrinth of the ear. The normal homeostasis in the structures and contents between the two fluid compartment systems--intracerebral and intralabyrinthine--is controlled by mechanisms involved in the maintenance of normal pressures, water and electrolyte content, and neurotransmitter activities. The initial pathophysiology (a reflection of an alteration in the vascular supply to the brain-ear) is hypothesized to be an initial acute inflammatory response, persistence of which results in ischemia and an irreversible alteration in the involved neural substrates of brain-ear. Clinically, a chronic multisymptom complex becomes manifest. The multisymptom complex, individual for each TBI patient regardless of the diagnostic TBI category (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe), initially reflects processes of inflammation and ischemia which, in brain, result in brain volume loss identified as neurodegeneration and hydrocephalus ex vacuo or an alteration in cerebrospinal fluid production (i.e., pseudotumor cerebri) and, in ear, secondary endolymphatic hydrops with associated cochleovestibular complaints of hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, ear blockage, and hyperacusis. The FDVTBE integrates and translates a neurovascular hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease to TBI. This study presents an FDVTBE hypothesis of TBI to explain the clinical association of head trauma (TBI) and central nervous system neurodegeneration with multisensory complaints, highlighted by and focusing on cochleovestibular complaints. A clinical case report, previously published for demonstration of the cerebrovascular medical significance of a particular type of tinnitus, and evidence-based basic science and clinical medicine are cited to provide objective evidence in support and demonstration of the FDVTBE.",{},,The international tinnitus journal,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng

A swelling of the face, pulsatile tinnitus, throbbing headache and bleeding comprise the main presenting symptoms. A bruit and thrill are usually present. Doppler ultrasonography and selective arteriography will provide the essential diagnostic information.

They have variable clinical presentation and prognosis, which depend on their location and venous hemodynamics. Treatment is based on the closure of the abnormal connections, which is usually conducted via arterial and/or transvenous endovascular techniques.

Embolization with Onyx<sup>®</sup> was successful, obtaining angiographic occlusion and symptom remission. However, on postoperative day 4, the patient presented with left facial palsy and spontaneous regression. Although embolization is an effective and safe procedure, complications may occur. Reflux of the embolic agent to the vasa nervorum of the cranial nerve may lead to ischemic neuropathy.

The patient had a recent endovascular transvenous embolization that was only partially successful, with a residual carotid cavernous fistula draining to the left superior ophthalmic vein and multiple cortical veins.

Multiple coils were placed in the posterior aspect of the sinus until there was complete occlusion of venous flow. Coils were packed up to the posterior aspect of the orbit near the junction of the cavernous sinus with the SOV, and the embolization was successful. Indirect CCFs have gradual onset and are usually low-flow. Low-flow CCFs might improve with medical management.Some CCFs may cause ocular manifestations and can be symptomatically managed with prism therapy or ocular patching for diplopia, lubrication for keratopathy, or topical agents for elevated intraocular pressures.

He underwent polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Target Tetra 360 (Fremont, CA: Stryker Neurovascular) detachable coil embolization followed by complete tumor resection. Pathology was consistent with hemangioblastoma. He presented with complete resolution of his symptoms immediately post-operatively and at a two-week follow-up. Our case highlighted the importance of pre-operative embolization to help achieve complete tumor resection which is considered curative in the treatment of hypervascular hemangioblastoma. The Target Tetra 360 detachable coil embolization is another material that can be considered.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.56891,PMC11042672,cerebellar hemangioblastoma; coil; preoperative embolization; pva; target tetra,Case Reports,United States,eng
38762752,Oculomotor Nerve Palsy Induced by a Cerebral Developmental Venous Anomaly: A Case Report and Comprehensive Review.,"Zhang, Jianying; Wang, Sisi; Jiang, Ying; Zhang, Yue",Zhang,"BACKGROUND Symptoms caused by developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are usually mild and unspecific. Despite the benign nature of DVAs, they can occasionally be symptomatic. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman presented with sudden diplopia and left eyelid ptosis for 10 days. A neurologic examination revealed left complete oculomotor nerve palsy. Other neurologic deficits, including eye pain or pulsatile tinnitus, were not detected. Furthermore, the visual acuity was normal. Additionally, no retinal hemorrhage, venous dilatation, or fundus tortuosity were observed. No ischemia lesions or neoplasms were observed in MRI, and no widening or enhancement of the cavernous sinus was detected in post-contrast T1-weighted images, but magnetic resonance tomography cerebral angiography (MRTA) detected an offending vessel compressing the left oculomotor nerve in the fossa interpeduncular. We hypothesized that oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) was caused by an abnormal arterial structure. However, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed no aneurysm or abnormal arterial structure in the arterial phase, while a tortuous and dilated collecting vein was detected in the venous phase, connecting the left temporal lobe to the left cavernous sinus. This indicated a typical caput medusae appearance, suggesting the mechanism of oculomotor palsy caused by compressive impairment of the DVA. The patient refused microvascular decompression surgery, and ONP persisted after 30 days. Management was conservative, with spontaneous resolution at 60 days and no recurrence during the 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS ONP is rarely caused by DVAs, which are easily ignored due to their benign nature. Cerebral vein examinations are advised for patients exhibiting clinical symptoms of unknown etiology.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.943363,PMC11117436,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
18309454,Surgical removal of small petroclival meningiomas.,"Ramina, R; Neto, M C; Fernandes, Y B; Silva, E B; Mattei, T A; Aguiar, P H P",Ramina,"Treatment of large petroclival meningiomas causing brain stem compression is surgical removal followed by radiotherapy or radiosurgery if the lesion was partially resected. The management of small petroclival meningiomas is, however, controversial. Clinical observation, radiosurgery and surgical removal are the options of treatment. The natural history of these tumours is not well known. Published series of patients treated with radiosurgery are not comparable with surgical series because the latter also includes large size tumours. In this paper we present a series of 18 patients with small petroclival meningiomas (diameter <or= 2.8 cm) treated with radical surgical removal. Total resection (Simpson's Grade 1) [43] was possible with minimal morbidity and no mortality. We present a series of small petroclival meningiomas (SPM) treated by radical surgical removal and compare the outcome with other management modalities proposed for these lesions. Eighteen patients with SPM were surgically treated at our department of neurological surgery. The tumours were classified as small when they had a diameter < 3.0 cm. Headaches (n = 12), diplopia (n = 8), facial hypoaesthesia (n = 3) and tinnitus (n = 6) were the most frequent symptoms at presentation. The approaches used were retrosigmoid (n = 14), fronto-orbito-zygomatic (n = 3) and presigmoid (n = 1). The post-operative follow-up ranged from 1 to 110 months (mean 41.8 months). Radical tumour resection (Simpson's Grades 1 and 2) was achieved in all patients. There was no major morbidity or mortality related to the surgical procedure. Transient abducent nerve palsy was the only post-operative complication. The pre-operative cranial nerves deficits improved after surgery. Only one patient had persistent diplopia postoperatively. Radical surgical removal of SPM is possible with minimal morbidity and may cure the patient. The effectiveness and outcome of surgery for small petroclival meningiomas should be compared with series treated by radiosurgery.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-007-1403-y,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

Brain MRI revealed cystic lesions with various imaging characteristics, including hypointensity on T1-weighted (T1W) images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted (T2W) images. The first patient's lesion showed rim enhancement after gadolinium administration. The second patient's lesion showed mixed signal intensity on both T1W and T2W images. The third patient's MRI showed a well-defined cystic lesion in the right CPA that compressed the brainstem. This lesion was hyperintense on T1W images and hypointense relative to cerebrospinal fluid on T2W images, and was peripherally enhanced after gadolinium administration. All three patients underwent surgical intervention through a suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy/craniectomy and lesions that did not adhere to adjacent tissues were removed completely. Histopathological examination confirmed the tumors to be adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. The post-operative course was uneventful for all patients uneventful and no tumor recurrences were detected at the last follow-up.

A novel technique that is useful for identifying the fistulous point is reported. A 71-year-old woman underwent endovascular therapy for a left direct CCF that presented with sudden diplopia and tinnitus. To identify the fistulous point, vertebral angiography with manual compression of the left carotid artery was attempted, as was slow injection of a contrast agent from a balloon guiding catheter, closing off the left internal carotid artery; however, the shunt flow was very rapid, and identification was not possible. Therefore, three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography of the vertebral artery was performed while also performing manual aspiration from the balloon guiding catheter, closing off the left internal carotid artery. This reduced early visualization of the cavernous sinus and enabled an aneurysm in the cavernous sinus to be clearly visualized. Embolization was performed transarterially and transvenously, and the shunt flow disappeared completely. Vertebral angiography combined with manual aspiration from a balloon guiding catheter closing off the internal carotid artery is useful for identifying the fistulous point in a direct CCF.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2015.06.023,,Balloon guiding catheter; Direct carotid-cavernous fistula; Fistulous point; Manual aspiration; Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

In this study, routine, medical education-focused cadaveric dissection of an 80-year-old male cadaver (cause of death was ventricular tachycardia) was performed. A case of agenesis of the left internal carotid artery and the carotid canal was identified. Upon investigation, we found that the compensatory pattern of irrigation in the Circle of Willis did not conform to previously described cases in the scientific literature. Further literature review suggested that such agenesis can be associated with a wide range of conditions from stroke, migraine, tinnitus, and Horner's syndrome. Due to the altered blood flow pattern, we caution the reading physician regarding the potential for ischemia and iatrogenic damage, particularly of the pituitary gland and eye.

We report the feasibility of a metal artifact reduction (MAR) algorithm on CT angiography (CTA) in the planning of direct surgery of dAVF after transarterial Onyx embolization. A 45-year-old male patient presented with right pulsatile tinnitus, and cerebral angiography demonstrated right tentorial dAVF. As the dAVF had not completely disappeared even after Onyx transarterial embolization, we planned direct surgery. Evaluation of the lesion was difficult on normal preoperative CTA because of Onyx artifacts, but CTA using MAR enabled a detailed planning of direct surgery. Direct surgery was performed through right retrosigmoid craniotomy. Referencing CTA using MAR, we identified the draining veins originating from the main drainer, which were coagulated and cut, achieving complete occlusion of the dAVF. His symptoms disappeared with no postoperative complications. CT angiography using MAR was useful for planning direct surgery after Onyx embolization. As the incidence of direct surgery after transarterial Onyx embolization for AVM or dAVF is increasing, MAR on CTA will become more important.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Asian journal of neurosurgery,10.1055/s-0042-1750386,PMC9473860,Onyx embolization; direct surgery; smart metal artifact reduction; tentorial dAVF,Case Reports,India,eng

17691661,Applications of the marchbanks transcranial-cerebral sonography technique in neurootology: preliminary report.,"Lehrer, Joel F; Ogunlusi, Ayo; Knutsen, Judith",Lehrer,"Transcranial-cerebral sonography (TCCS) is a noninvasive technique that allows clinicians to detect nanoliter (billionths of a liter) displacements of the tympanic membrane. This technique was developed to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in cases of shunted hydrocephalus; it takes advantage of the CSF connection to the inner ear through the cochlear aqueduct. The movements of the tympanic membrane that are observed in TCCS are those evoked by the acoustic stapedius reflex and those spontaneous movements generated by intracranial arterial, venous, and respiratory pulses transmitted through the inner ear to the stapes and thence to the tympanic membrane. Analysis of the amplitude and direction of these displacements has enabled neurosurgeons and neurologists to estimate CSF pressures accurately in patients evaluated by TCCS. TCCS allows for applications in neurootology, particularly in those patients who present with symptoms of pulsating tinnitus, dizziness and imbalance, or hearing loss. This preliminary report describes the test and its application in a series of patients whose diagnoses included pulsating tinnitus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Ménière's disease, perilymphatic fistula, perilymphatic hypertension, arterial stenosis, and Arnold-Chiari syndrome.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is nowadays an established treatment method for brain AVMs, with high obliteration and low complication rates. Here we describe the first report of head extracranial AVMs successfully treated by Gamma Knife (GK) as a retrospective historical cohort. Over a 9-year period, 2 cases of extracranial AVMs were treated by GK Perfexion (Elekta Instruments AB, Stockholm, Sweden) at a single institution. A stereotactic frame and multimodal imaging, including digital subtraction angiography (DSA), were used. The prescribed dose was 24 Gy at the 50% isodose line. The first case was of a patient with pulsating tinnitus and left superficial parotido-condylian AVM. Embolization achieved partial obliteration. Tinnitus disappeared during the following 6 months after GK. The second case was a patient with repetitive gingival hemorrhages and right superior maxillary AVM, fed by the right internal maxillary and facial arteries. Embolization achieved partial obliteration with recurrence of symptoms. GK was further performed. DSA confirmed complete obliteration in both patients. Single-fraction GK radiosurgery appears to be safe and effective for extracranial AVMs. We recommend prescribing doses that are comparable to the ones used for brain AVMs (i.e., 24 Gy). A stereotactic frame is an important tool to ensure higher accuracy in the context of these particular locations. However, in selected cases, a mask could be applied either for single fraction purposes (if in a non-mobile location) or for hypofractionation, in case of larger volumes. These findings should be validated in larger cohorts, inclusively in terms of dose prescription.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000509753,,Arteriovenous malformations; Extracranial; Gamma Knife; Head; Radiosurgery,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Pure-tone audiogram, speech discrimination testing, stapedial reflex testing, and auditory brainstem response were performed to localize the site of lesion in the auditory pathways. Electronystagmography was also performed to evaluate the function of the vestibular system. The most common affected site on brain MRI was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n=11).

Electronystagmography demonstrated no response to caloric stimulation in 10 patients (83%). In our series, sudden deafness was an important sign for the diagnosis of AICA infarction.

39024994,Direct carotid-cavernous fistula after functional endoscopic sinus surgery - A case report.,"Chen, Shu-Wei; Lee, Chien-Hui",Chen,"Direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCF) are primarily caused by head trauma. Some cases have also been attributed to iatrogenic injuries during endovascular procedures. However, the reports of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) associated with direct CCFs are extremely rare. A 52-year-old male worker, who suffered from chronic sinusitis and underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) performed by an otolaryngologist. Intra-operative finding indicated a left sphenoid sinus wall injury without internal carotid artery bleeding, which was repaired using mucosa and tissue glue. One month after discharge, he began experiencing tinnitus, headache and swelling in his left eye. Cerebral angiography revealed a direct carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) on the left side. The patient underwent transarterial and transvenous stent-assisted coiling using detachable coils and Onyx, which alleviated his symptoms. A cavernous-carotid fistula following FESS is an exceedingly rare occurrence first reported by Karaman et al. in 2009. The incidence of internal carotid artery injury during FESS or endonasal endoscopic surgery (EES) is estimated to be between 0 and 0.1 %. Currently, there is no definitive explanation for the development of a carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) post-FESS. Previous studies suggest that procedures like transsphenoidal surgery and EES can induce pseudoaneurysms in the internal carotid artery. If the cavernous pseudoaneurysm ruptures, it could lead to the formation of a CCF. A direct cavernous-carotid fistula following functional endoscopic sinus surgery is a very rare.

12296656,Distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms. Report of four cases.,"Zager, Eric L; Shaver, Ellen G; Hurst, Robert W; Flamm, Eugene S",Zager,"Aneurysms of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) are rare; fewer than 100 cases have been reported. The authors detail their experience with four cases and present endovascular as well as microsurgical management options. The medical records and neuroimaging studies obtained in four patients who were treated at a single institution were reviewed. Clinical presentations, neuroimaging and intraoperative findings, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. There were three men and one woman; their mean age was 43 years. Two patients presented with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and two presented with ataxia and vertigo (one with tinnitus, the other with hearing loss). Angiographic studies demonstrated aneurysms of the distal segment of the AICA. In one patient with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and multiple cerebellar hemangioblastomas, a feeding artery aneurysm was found on a distal branch of the AICA. Three of the patients underwent successful surgical obliteration of their aneurysms, one by clipping, one by trapping, and one by resection along with the tumor. The fourth patient underwent coil embolization of the distal AICA and the aneurysm. All patients made an excellent neurological recovery. Patients with aneurysms in this location may present with typical features of an acute SAH or with symptoms referable to the cerebellopontine angle. Evaluation with computerized tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR angiography, and digital subtraction angiography should be performed. For lesions distal to branches coursing to the brainstem, trapping and aneurysm resection are viable options that do not require bypass. Endovascular obliteration is also a reasonable option, although the possibility of retrograde thrombosis of the AICA is a concern.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2002.97.3.0692,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
35399907,Dissecting aneurysm of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in the internal auditory canal presenting with deafness without hemorrhage: A case report and literature review.,"Okada, Tomohisa; Makimoto, Kaisei; Yoshii, Riichiro; Yoshimoto, Koji; Moinuddin, F M; Yamashita, Masaru; Arita, Kazunori",Okada,"Anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) aneurysms in the internal auditory canal (IAC) are rare. We have reported a case of dissecting AICA aneurysm in the IAC presenting initially with the eighth nerve palsy followed by the seventh nerve palsy without hemorrhage. A 68-year-old woman presented with a sudden onset of vertigo accompanied by deafness and tinnitus on the right side that was preceded by intermittent right retroauricular pain 2 weeks before. Audiogram showed severe sensorineural hearing loss. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated absence of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) suggested a tiny aneurysm at the fundus of the IAC accompanied with thinning of the lateral pontine segment of the AICA. Conservative treatment led to moderate improvement of the symptoms. However, the patient developed the right retroauricular pain again, followed by the right facial paralysis 5 months later but still without signs of hemorrhage on MRI. Digital subtraction angiogram showed dissecting aneurysm in the IAC. The patient was managed with oral steroids and direct intervention was avoided due to a risk of ischemia supposed by large area irrigated by the AICA. Follow-up MRA 18 months after the first presentation showed improvement in the narrowing of the AICA proximal to the aneurysm. The patient was functionally independent despite right-sided hearing loss and slight facial paresis. This report warns physicians that a dissecting AICA aneurysm without subarachnoid hemorrhage may cause eighth and seventh nerve palsy.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_1220_2021,PMC8986759,Anterior inferior cerebellar artery; Deafness; Dissecting aneurysm; Facial palsy.

Right external carotid angiography showed the tumour to be supplied by many branches of the right occipital artery, the posterior branches of the middle meningeal artery, and the posterior auricular artery, and the dural AVF fed by the occipital artery and the meningeal branches of the right vertebral artery. She underwent surgery via a combined right supra- and infratentorial approach. The tumour had invaded and blocked the right transverse sinus, which was resected. After surgery the patient was free of headache and tinnitus was diminished. Histological examination found that the tumour was a fibrous meningioma and that the orifice of the vein at the transverse sinus was blocked by the tumour. Serial follow-up cerebral angiography 2 months after surgery showed no change in the AVF, but 9 months after surgery confirmed disappearance of the AVF. This AVF was caused by occlusion of the right transverse sinus by the meningioma and was an acquired lesion.",{},,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-003-0030-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

In some circumstances, successful obliteration may not be possible by endovascular means, and such cases may require a direct surgical treatment. The authors report on their experience with the use of cranial base approaches in the treatment of deep and complex DAVF. Nine patients were treated between 1992 and 2003. There were six females and three males. Four patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, two with progressive myelopathy, two with tinnitus, and one with incapacitating chronic seizures. Four DAVF were tentorial, two transverse sigmoid, one craniocervical, one straight sinus, and one sphenoparietal. Endovascular embolization was attempted and unsuccessful in four cases, and was successful only as an adjunct to surgery in four others. All patients required the use of cranial base approaches to disconnect the fistula or resect the nidus. Complete obliteration of the fistula was possible in all cases. Six-month follow-up results were obtained on seven patients where there was no evidence of recurrence. One postoperative temporal-lobe hematoma required surgical evacuation. One patient died two years postoperatively from an unrelated cause.

Case 1 is a 38-year-old male with protein S deficiency who developed generalized seizure due to SSS thrombosis. Local fibrinolysis was achieved in the acute stage. His 10-month follow-up angiogram revealed an asymptomatic acquired dural AVF arising from the middle meningeal artery and the anterior cerebral artery with drainage to the thrombosed cortical vein in the right frontal lobe. Furthermore, his 2-year follow-up angiogram revealed a de novo pial AVF from the middle cerebral artery in the Sylvian fissure with drainage to the cortical vein initially thrombosed. However, this asymptomatic pial AVF caused bleeding in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere 12 years after onset, whereas the dural AVF spontaneously disappeared. Surgical disconnection was successfully performed to eliminate the source of hemorrhage. Case 2 is a 50-year-old male with a past history of SSS thrombosis with protein S deficiency who developed pulsatile tinnitus and generalized seizure. His angiogram showed a cortical dural AVF in the left parietal lobe and a sporadic dural AVF involving the right sigmoid sinus. The parietal lesion was eliminated by transarterial embolization followed by craniotomy. However, a de novo pial AVF emerged from the middle cerebral artery adjacent to the previously treated lesion. Of four cortical AVFs in two patients, thrombosis of cortical veins caused by protein S deficiency might play an important role in their formation. Long-term follow-up is required because this peculiar disorder has an unusual clinical course.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.cr2012-0311,PMC4533415,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,eng

The signs and symptoms, except for pulsatile tinnitus, vary and apparently depend on the presence of impaired venous drainage, which may produce increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, and transient or persistent neurologic deficits. Eight of the 14 patients described had occlusion of one or both transverse or sigmoid sinuses. Two patients had angiographic demonstration of sigmoid or transverse sinus occlusion (one 1 year and the other 4 years) before the development of an arteriovenous malformation in the appropriate sinus.

Osteosarcomas or osteogenic sarcomas consist of neoplastic cells that produce osteoid bone or immature bone. Sarcomas develop more in the mandible than the maxilla. The exact diagnosis of different types of sarcomas is based on the immunohistochemical investigation. These rare tumours are of mesenchymal origin; osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas are the most common types-Ewing's sarcomas. The use of proton beam radiotherapy in the treatment of osteosarcoma of the maxilla is rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of successfully treated (surgery and proton beam radiotherapy) poorly differentiated highly aggressive osteosarcoma in the ethmoids and maxillary sinus and morbidity after the treatment. We were presented with a case of a 65-year-old man with anaesthesia and palsy of the right face. The stomatology department performed the extraction of a tooth. One month later, the wound was still open. The histology showed an osteogenic sarcoma in the area of the wound. The oncologist and maxillofacial surgeons in a catchment hospital recommended a nonsurgical approach. Hence, we performed a radical maxillectomy and ethmoidectomy, after which we continued with proton bean radiotherapy. The patient is now five years after therapy without signs of sarcoma; however, he has blindness in the right eye and reduced vision in the left eye, as well as gliosis of the brain, vertigo, tinnitus, trismus, and ancylostomiases. Head and neck osteosarcomas treatment is considered a complex multidisciplinary task. It is currently argued that there is no clear therapeutic protocol for successful treatment. Innovations in treatment modalities such as proton beam radiotherapy appear to have potential, although their effects on long-term morbidity and survival outcomes are still undetermined. We present a rare case report of an osteosarcoma of the maxilla involving an innovative, successful treatment procedure combining surgical excision followed by proton beam radiotherapy. This treatment approach may enable maximum tumour control. This protocol has not been adequately described in the world literature for this diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58091141,PMC9500801,ethmoid bone; maxillary bone; oncology; osteosarcoma; prognosis; protocol; survival data; treatment,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Isolated lesions of the inferior colliculus have previously been reported, whereas no detailed description of a localized involvement of the lateral lemniscus is yet available. We report a unilateral lesion of the lateral lemniscus by a bleeding in a cavernoma. Symptoms included strictly contralateral tinnitus and auditory impairment, with normal pure-tone and speech audiometry. Conversely, the dichotic listening test revealed an extinction of contralateral ear input. The brainstem auditory evoked potentials disclosed a reduced and delayed wave V only after contralateral ear stimulation, while the middle latency evoked potentials were normal. This observation shows that a unilateral lesion of the lateral lemniscus can produce auditory symptoms. The dysfunction of auditory pathways is associated with specific electrophysiological abnormalities that can be assessed by evoked potential recording.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Audiology & neuro-otology,10.1159/000084025,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

Occasionally, they present with focal neurologic deficits, a dementia-like syndrome, hemorrhage, or ischemic infarction. This study is based on the case of a 71-year-old gentleman who presented with 6 months of progressive forgetfulness, inattention, and hypersomnolence. Four weeks prior to presentation, he developed symptoms of left-sided pain, numbness, and worsening weakness. Neurologic examination demonstrated hypersomnolence, a score of 30/38 on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and left hemiparesis. MRI brain revealed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities with associated enhancement. MR venogram (MRV) showed a vascular malformation in the posterior fossa and occlusion of the straight sinus. Conventional cerebral angiogram confirmed a tentorial dAVF. The dAVF was definitively treated with transarterial embolization, followed by clip ligation of the arterialized draining vein. Twelve weeks later, there was clinical resolution of left hemiparesis and improvement in cognitive status. MRI revealed complete resolution of the thalamic hyperintensities. MRV demonstrated recanalization of the straight sinus. Intracranial dAVFs are uncommon but potentially life-threatening acquired vascular malformations. The initiating factor is venous hypertension, causing retrograde flow, venous congestion, ischemia, and sometimes infarction. The spectrum of clinical manifestations in dAVFs reflects the degree of venous congestion present. If retrograde venous flow is surgically obliterated, then venous hypertension may be reversible. Bilateral thalamic venous congestion can present as a thalamic dementia. We conclude that intracranial dAVFs with thalamic venous congestion should be considered in the diagnostic differential for patients who present with subacute cognitive decline and T2 hyperintense thalamic signal change.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9746-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Other inner disorders, including Meniere's disease (MD), perilymphatic fistula and intralabyrinthine schwannoma, might sometimes result in a similar scenario. On the other hand, PT is frequently associated with dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), while conductive hearing loss (CHL) is extremely rare in this clinical setting. A 47-year-old patient was referred to our center with progressive left-sided PT alongside ipsilateral fullness and hearing loss. She also experienced headache and dizziness. Otoscopy and video-oculographic examination were unremarkable. Conversely, a detailed instrumental audio-vestibular assessment revealed low-frequency CHL with normal impedance audiometry, slight left-sided caloric weakness, slightly impaired vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left and normal results on the video-head impulse test, consistent with an MD-like instrumental profile. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed an early enhancement of the left transverse sinus, consistent with a left DAVF between the left occipital artery and the transverse sinus, which was then confirmed by angiography. A trans-arterial embolization with Onyx glue was performed, resulting in a complete recession of the symptoms. Post-operatively, the low-frequency ABG disappeared, supporting the possible role of venous intracranial hypertension and abnormal pressure of inner ear fluids in the onset of symptoms and offering new insights into the pathomechanism of inner ear CHL.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Audiology research,10.3390/audiolres13060073,PMC10660785,Meniere’s disease; air–bone gap; conductive hearing loss; dural arteriovenous fistula; inner ear fluids; pseudo-conductive hearing loss; pulsatile tinnitus; venous intracranial hypertension,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

CASE REPORT A Japanese man with diabetes in his 50s experienced fever and loss of consciousness, with no history of international travel. In our hospital, gram-negative diplococci were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patient by Gram staining, although the rapid agglutination test and cultures of blood and CSF were negative. Multiplex polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) testing returned positive results for meningococcus and parechovirus. Brain MRI revealed a finding of meningitis, but there were no indications of encephalitis. To determine the serotype and genotype, we sent the sample to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, which identified the serogroup and sequence type (ST) as type B and 2057, respectively. Despite the unknown antimicrobial susceptibility, the patient responded well to empirical treatment with ceftriaxone at 2 g every 12 h, and was discharged with remaining symptoms of dizziness, headache, difficulty hearing in the left ear, and tinnitus in the left ear. CONCLUSIONS In Japan, vaccines covering serogroups A, C, and W/Y are available but not routinely administered. According to epidemiological surveillance reports, serogroup B is the second most common cause of meningococcal meningitis in Japan, yet there is no corresponding vaccine available in the country. This case has prompted a review of the epidemiology of meningococcus in Japan, encompassing strategies for vaccination and hospital infection control to prevent droplet transmission, which includes post-exposure prophylaxis when no prior measures have been implemented.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.943973,PMC11315615,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The most frequent symptoms and signs are headache, seizures, focal deficits, and papilledema. A number of rare atypical manifestations have been described. Cerebral venous thrombosis may present with an isolated intracranial hypertension type picture, thunderclap headache, attacks of migraine with aura, isolated psychiatric disturbances, pulsatile tinnitus, isolated or multiple cranial nerve involvement, and occasionally as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) or transient ischemic attack. Our patient presented with thunderclap headache and transient ischemic attack like episode with obvious SAH on CT scan.

Five patients (31%) had an acute auditory syndrome as a prodrome of AICA infarction one to 10 days before onset of other brain stem or cerebellar symptoms. Two types of acute auditory syndrome were found: recurrent transient hearing loss with or without tinnitus (n = 3), and a single episode of prolonged hearing loss with or without tinnitus (n = 2). The episodic symptoms were brief, lasting only minutes. The tinnitus preceding the infarction was identical to the tinnitus experienced at the time of infarction. At the time of infarction, all patients developed hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and ipsilateral hemiataxia. The most commonly affected site was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n = 5). Four of the five patients had incomplete hearing loss and all had absence of vestibular function to caloric stimulation on the affected side. Acute auditory syndrome may be a warning sign of impending pontocerebellar infarction in the distribution of the AICA.

We report a case of paroxysmal recurrent vertigo accompanying clicking tinnitus on the left side in a 61-year-old patient. He had undergone microvascular decompression to treat the left-side hemifacial spasm 6 years prior. The patient first developed vertigo attacks about 3 years after microvascular decompression, and the attacks increased in frequency over the last 4 months. Video-nystagmography revealed a background right-beating nystagmus which was reversed every 55 seconds, to left-beating nystagmus for 17 seconds. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated a compression of the cisternal segment of the left vestibulocochlear nerve between the tortuous right vertebral artery and the posterior wall of the left porus acusticus internus. Under the diagnosis of VP, 300 mg oxcarbazepine was administered daily, which relieved the symptoms dramatically. The neurovascular cross-compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve by the contralateral vertebral artery tortuosity can cause VP. Periodic paroxysms of right-beating nystagmus accompanying the left-side tinnitus during vertigo attacks in our patient can be explained by secondary central hyperactivity in both vestibular and cochlear nuclei following long-standing neurovascular cross-compression.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000027815,PMC8589239,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient underwent an emergency diagnostic cerebral angiogram. Besides an indirect carotid-cavernous fistula on the left side, a right-sided persistent trigeminal artery terminating as the dominant hemispheric trunk of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery was incidentally noted. The vermian branch of the right posteroinferior cerebellar artery arose from the ipsilateral vertebral artery, whereas duplicate superior cerebellar arteries supplied the left posteroinferior cerebellar artery region. The patient was treated for the indirect carotid-cavernous fistula with detachable platinum coils and N-butyl cyanoacrylate, resulting in the resolution of her symptoms. We report a case of a persistent trigeminal artery supplying only the cerebellar hemisphere.

The tumour occluded the left internal jugular vein at the bulb. Our patient opted for monitoring, but the tinnitus progressed and became debilitating, prompting him to proceed with embolisation of the tumour.

Occlusion of the DAVF achieved symptomatic relief. A quandary develops during a procedure when the surgeon discovers that another intervention could satisfy the patient, while the patient is under anaesthesia. The higher flow in the DAVF likely causes the tinnitus in those with a patent sigmoid sinus, and embolisation of the DAVF alone could achieve relief.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2018-224860,PMC5990088,neuroimaging; neurooncology; neurosurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Pulsatile tinnitus represents a minor subgroup of less than 10% of all patients suffering from tinnitus. Pulsatile tinnitus - different from permanent mostly idiopathic tinnitus is mainly caused by physical sources related to vascular pathologies resulting in a change in blood volume and pressure or an alteration of the vessel lumen. Differential diagnosis for pulsatile tinnitus include dural arteriovenous fistulas, glomus tumors of the jugular foramen and the middle ear or atherosclerotic diseases of the carotid artery in the petrous or cavernous segment. Anomalies of the dural sinuses and the jugular bulb have been described as rare sources of synchronized tinnitus. The Woven EndoBridge (WEB, Microvention, Tustin, CA) is an intraaneurysmal flow diverter for the treatment of broad-based arterial aneurysms with a high safety and effectiveness profile. The initial version of the WEB with a dual layer structure evolved to a single layer structure in two different versions (WEB SL, WEB SLS). The WEB system does not require a concomitant antiplatelet therapy compared to other intraluminal devices as extra-aneurysmal flow-diverters or intracranial stents.

In recent years sudden deafness has been frequently described in association with anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction generally presenting along with other brainstem and cerebellar signs such as ataxia, dysmetria and peripheral facial palsy. The authors report a rare clinical case of a 53-year-old man who suddenly developed hearing loss and tinnitus without any brainstem or cerebellar signs. Computed tomography of his brain was normal, and the audiological results localized the lesion causing deafness to the inner ear. Surprisingly, magnetic resonance imaging showed an ischemic infarct in the right AICA territory. This case represents the fifth in the literature to date but it confirms that AICA occlusion can cause sudden deafness even without brainstem or cerebellar signs. Therefore, we recommend submitting the patient for neuroimaging, as an emergency, in order to exclude infarction of the AICA territory. By doing this, it may be possible to limit the extent of the lesion by commencing early therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,ORL; journal for oto-rhino-laryngology and its related specialties,10.1159/000327523,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
34345481,Utility of targeted balloon protection of the venous sinus for endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula by transarterial embolization with Onyx: A case report and literature review.,"Tagawa, Masahiko; Inoue, Akihiro; Murayama, Kentaro; Matsumoto, Shirabe; Ozaki, Saya; Nishikawa, Masahiro; Shigekawa, Seiji; Watanabe, Hideaki; Kunieda, Takeharu",Tagawa,"Onyx has already been reported as an effective and safe agent in transarterial embolization of cranial dural arteriovenous fistula (d-AVF). However, successful treatment is related to not only complete shunt obliteration but also preservation of a normal route of venous drainage. Here, we present a case of transverse sigmoid d-AVF in which successful treatment was achieved by transarterial Onyx embolization with targeted balloon protection of the venous drainage. A 70-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of tinnitus in the left ear and mild headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a cluster of abnormal blood vessels in the area of the left transverse sinus (TS)-sigmoid sinus (SS) junction. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a Cognard type IIa d-AVF at the left TS-SS junction, supplied mainly by vessels such as the left middle meningeal artery, left occipital artery, and left meningohypophyseal trunk. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral TS-SS was recognized as a functional sinus and the left vein of Labbe drained into the TS near the drainage channel. Based on these findings, we decided to perform endovascular treatment under a transarterial approach with Onyx using targeted balloon protection of the venous sinus to protect against Onyx migration and preserve antegrade sinus flow. The patient recovered well without sequelae, and follow-up MRI 12 months later showed complete disappearance of the d-AVF. This treatment strategy using targeted balloon protection may be very useful to preserve antegrade sinus flow in patients with Cognard type IIa d-AVF.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_503_2021,PMC8326100,Dural arteriovenous fistula; Onyx; Targeted balloon protection of the venous sinus; Transarterial embolization,Case Reports,United States,eng

Appropriate treatment that aims to reduce the risk of intracranial bleeding and manage the patient's symptoms requires a multidisciplinary approach. The patient was a 62-year-old man who developed symptoms of progressive right-sided otalgia and tinnitus. Cross-sectional imaging revealed long-standing venous congestion with intracranial hemorrhage in the right parieto-occipital region. Moreover, cerebral angiography demonstrated multiple complex dAVFs at the right transverse sinus-sigmoid sinus (TS-SS) junction, right posterior condylar confluence (PCC), and torcula. Treatment consisted of one session of endovascular treatment, in which transarterial Onyx embolization was used to treat the dVAF at the right TS-SS junction, transvenous coil embolization for the dVAF at the right PCC, and particle embolization for both occipital arteries feeding the torcular dAVF. Postoperative improvement with favorable clinical outcomes was observed at the patient's last follow-up visit. Multiple cranial dAVFs are an uncommon vascular lesion, which can present with unusual symptoms such as otalgia. Moreover, a single session of endovascular therapy can treat this lesion, ie, it can improve the patient's symptoms and provide a beneficial long-term outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Clinical interventions in aging,10.2147/CIA.S277762,PMC7737546,coils; condylar vein; dural arteriovenous fistula; endovascular; transvenous embolization,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

Among these, intracranial hemorrhage is a severe complication. A 72-year-old male presented with headache and pulsatile tinnitus. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden II/Cognard IIa+b DAVF. He underwent stage 1 transarterial embolization of the occipital artery which reduced shunting by 30%. Several attempts were made to access the fistula during stage 2 transvenous embolization, but it was not possible to access the left transverse sinus fistula site since there was no communication across the torcula from the right transverse sinus and the left inferior sigmoid-jugular bulb was occluded. Therefore, a single burr hole was drilled and direct access to the DAVF was achieved with a micropuncture needle under neuronavigational guidance. The left transverse-sigmoid sinus junction was then embolized with coils. After the procedure, angiography revealed that the DAVF was cured with no residual shunting. This case demonstrates how minimally invasive surgery provides an alternative method to access a DVAF when conventional transarterial and/or transvenous embolization treatment options are not possible. Each DAVF case has unique anatomy and physiology, and creative multi-disciplinary strategies can often yield the best results.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci13060871,PMC10295841,DAVF; burr hole; dural arteriovenous fistula; endovascular surgery; neurosurgery,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing lesion of the left CPA with no signal on fat suppression sequences. Despite conservative therapy, the patient developed progressive hemifacial spasm, and a suboccipital craniotomy approach was used to debulk the tumor, which encased cranial nerves V, VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI. Surgical histopathology demonstrated mature adipocytes, consistent with lipoma. Two years after surgery, the patient remains free of facial nerve symptoms. Cerebellopontine angle lipomas are rare lesions of the skull base and are reliably diagnosed with T1-weighted and fat suppression magnetic resonance sequences, which we recommend in the routine radiologic workup of CPA tumors. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial because most CPA lipomas should be managed conservatively.

There have been at least 40 previously reported cases of aneurysms of the petrous portion of the carotid artery. These aneurysms can be mycotic, traumatic, or developmental in origin. They can present with massive otorrhagia or epistaxis from acute rupture or with decreased hearing and paresis of the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and, less frequently, of the ninth, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves caused by direct pressure. They can also produce pulsatile tinnitus, and sometimes they are discovered as a retrotympanic vascular mass during otological examination. The treatment of choice is carotid artery occlusion. Trapping of the aneurysm by detachable balloons eliminates immediately the risk of hemorrhage, offers the possibility of test occlusion of the internal carotid artery with the patient awake prior to permanent occlusion, and should also reduce the risk of thromboembolism. It should be preceded by a bypass procedure when preliminary evaluation indicates that the patient will not tolerate internal carotid artery occlusion.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.1986.65.2.0249,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Of 248 patients with intracranial DAVFs managed at our institution, nine patients (3.6%; four men, five women; mean age 62 years) were diagnosed with hypoglossal canal DAVF. We investigated patient characteristics with respect to clinical symptoms, neuroradiological findings, efficacy and complications related to endovascular treatment. Seven patients had experienced head injury. All patients presented with pulsatile tinnitus. One patient displayed ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy before treatment. MR angiography showed a ""magic wand"" appearance between the affected hypoglossal canal and the internal jugular vein in four patients. Angiography demonstrated an AV fistula on the medial aspect of the superior jugular bulb, mostly arising from the bilateral occipital, ascending pharyngeal and vertebral arteries with drainage to the internal jugular vein via the anterior condylar vein. Contralateral carotid injection accurately clarified the shunting point. Five patients underwent endovascular treatment: transarterial embolization (TAE; n = 2), transvenous embolization (TVE; n = 2), and TAE/TVE (n = 1). Complete shunt obliteration was achieved in four patients and shunt reduction in one. The remaining four patients were treated conservatively and the shunt had disappeared at follow-up. Postoperative hypoglossal nerve palsy occurred in one patient after TVE, possibly due to coil overpacking. The incidence of hypoglossal canal DAVF was not very low in our series. Contralateral carotid injection is an essential examination to provide an accurate diagnosis.

The authors comprehensively analyze multiple features in a series of dural arteriovenous fistulas with transosseous arterial feeders involving the jugular bulb. Four patients who underwent surgery via the transcondylar approach to treat dural arteriovenous fistulas around the jugular foramen were retrospectively reviewed. Previously, endovascular treatment was attempted in all patients. The success of the surgical treatment was examined with postoperative angiography. Complete obliteration of the dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) was achieved in three patients, and significant flow reduction in one individual. All patients had a good postoperative outcome, and only one experienced mild hypoglossal nerve palsy. Despite extensive bone drilling, an occipitocervical fusion was necessary in only one patient with bilateral lesions. The use of an individually tailored transcondylar approach to treat dural arteriovenous fistulas at the region of the jugular foramen is most effective.

Radiosurgery is typically performed as gamma knife surgery (GKS), although other modalities are being applied with increasing frequency. A differentiating feature in responsiveness to microsurgery or GKS is whether the VS is cystic or solid. A cystic VS is less responsive to GKS than a solid VS, representing a challenging clinical problem. GKS treatment of a cystic VS usually results in sustained expansion, sustained regression, or transient expansion followed by sustained regression. In this article, we report an atypical fluctuating course of a cystic VS after GKS, ultimately requiring surgical intervention. A 66-year-old woman presented with asymmetric hearing loss and tinnitus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 2.0-cm unilateral cystic VS within the cerebellopontine angle. After GKS with a 12-Gy dose to the 50% isodose line, the tumor expanded transiently to 3.2 cm and then regressed to 1.0 cm over the next 2 years. She presented several months later with new-onset dizziness, ataxia, and facial numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 3.2-cm multicystic VS that compressed the brainstem. After microsurgical tumor excision, the patient's symptoms abated. Our case report is a novel demonstration that a cystic VS that has regressed after GKS is still at risk for expansion.

However, the side effects of salicylate toxicity can be severe, and delay in the diagnosis may increase the risk of mortality. Neurologic symptoms are a common presenting feature of salicylate toxicity in the elderly, and their recognition may allow earlier diagnosis. This report is of a case of a 61-year-old woman who presented with acute focal neurologic deficit associated with salicylate toxicity and who had a previous history of stroke. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department after awakening with left-sided weakness. She had a history of ischemic stroke with an associated seizure disorder. The patient denied recent seizure, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no evidence of an acute stroke. Following her arrival, she became acutely confused and complained of tinnitus, shortness of breath, and blurred vision. On direct questioning, she gave a history of excessive use of salicylate for the previous two to three weeks. Her initial serum salicylate level was significantly increased at 78.1 mg/dl (upper therapeutic limit, 19.9 mg/dl). She recovered completely following treatment with oral activated charcoal, intravenous sodium bicarbonate, and potassium replacement.

They often require surgical resection and postoperative radiation/chemotherapy based on their histologic grade. While necrosis caused by preoperative embolization and spontaneous tumor infarction is appreciated by pathologists when staging meningiomas, intraoperative events including large bore artery occlusion may also alter the histopathologic picture of a benign meningioma. Hence, they should be considered when signs of unexpected ischemia and necrosis are found, as these same phenotypes are also hallmarks of a higher-grade disease. We describe a case of a man with a large ventral foramen magnum meningioma who underwent temporary intraoperative occlusion of the vertebral artery, leading to ischemic tumor necrosis with abundant neutrophil invasion when the tumor was eventually examined histologically.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.7754,PMC7243071,acute ischemic necrosis; aneurysmal clips; foramen magnum; meningioma; myelopathy; tinnitus; vertebral artery,Case Reports,United States,eng

We report a patient with carotid cavernous fistula secondary to a ruptured internal carotid artery aneurysm embedded within a prolactinoma. A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with sudden headache, vomiting, and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small acute subdural hematoma, recurrent prolactinoma, and left cavernous carotid aneurysm. Conservative therapy was initiated. Her serum prolactin level at hospitalization was 11,300 μg/L; therefore, we initiated cabergoline therapy. Twenty days after cabergoline administration, she suddenly presented with left conjunctival injection and pulsatile tinnitus. Angiography showed a left direct carotid cavernous fistula with a connection between the cavernous internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus via the aneurysm and venous congestion. To prevent hemorrhagic stroke, we scheduled staged surgery. First, we urgently performed embolization of the cavernous sinus and fistula. One month later, to prevent aneurysm rerupture, we performed a radical operation with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery double anastomosis with proximal occlusion of the left internal carotid artery at the cervical portion. The patient was discharged 2 weeks after surgery without neurological deficits. Follow-up angiography revealed complete occlusion of the aneurysm 2 months postoperatively.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the face and brain demonstrated prominent right facial and jugular venous vascularity. Catheter angiography confirmed the suspected facial arteriovenous fistula (AVF). A transarterial approach was used to explore the AVF which arose from a laceration of the right internal maxillary artery and which fistulized directly with the pterygoid venous plexus. Endosurgical repair utilizing three non-fibered platinum coils was done under conscious sedation at the same setting as the diagnostic angiogram. Angiographically, the fistula was obliterated, and the patient's bruit and tinnitus immediately resolved.

With this technique, we temporarily change the Borden classification from type II to type III, avoiding venous compromise and reducing the risk of Onyx migration into the patent sinus. A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months' duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labbé. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 × 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins. No procedure-related complications were observed and the patient remained free of recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period. Short-length balloon-protected Onyx embolization can be safe and effective for the treatment of Borden type II DAVF.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2020.01.018,PMC7015838,HyperForm balloon; Lateral tentorial sinus; Onyx; Sinus protection; Tentorial dural arteriovenous fistula,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

Case report and tertiary care hospital. A 66-year-old man with diabetes mellitus developed sudden bilateral deafness, unilateral tinnitus, and vertigo 7 days before the onset of dysarthria, facial weakness, and ataxia. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed hyperintensities in the right lateral pons and right middle cerebral peduncle and a possible abnormality of the left middle cerebellar peduncle. A magnetic resonance angiogram showed moderately severe stenosis of the distal vertebral artery and middle third of the basilar artery. The patient's right limb coordination and gait improved steadily over several weeks, but there was no improvement in hearing in his right ear. The relatively isolated onset of deafness as well as the severity and persistence of the hearing loss led us to conclude that the hearing loss in this case was likely due to prominent hypoperfusion of the internal auditory artery, with labyrinthine infarction as the earliest event.

Bilateral tinnitus is frequently observed in patients with noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis, ototoxic medication, and metabolic and psychiatric disease. In the case we present, the synchronous sensory and auditory symptoms are likely due to seizure activity affecting the primary auditory and somatosensory cortex.
