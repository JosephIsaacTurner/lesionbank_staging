30340181,Tactile enumeration: A case study of acalculia.,"Cohen, Zahira Z; Arend, Isabel; Yuen, Kenneth; Naparstek, Sharon; Gliksman, Yarden; Veksler, Ronel; Henik, Avishai",Cohen,"Enumeration is one of the building blocks of arithmetic and fingers are used as a counting tool in early steps. Subitizing-fast and accurate enumeration of small quantities-has been vastly studied in the visual modality, but less in the tactile modality. We explored tactile enumeration using fingers, and gray matter (GM) changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), in acalculia. We examined JD, a 22-year-old female with acalculia following a stroke to the left inferior parietal cortex. JD and a neurologically healthy normal comparison (NC) group reported how many fingers were stimulated. JD was tested at several time points, including at acute and chronic phases. Using the sensory intact hand for tactile enumeration, JD showed deficit in the acute phase, compared to the NC group, and improvement in the chronic phase of (1) the RT slope of enumerating up to four stimuli, (2) enumerating neighboring fingers, and (3) arithmetic fluency performance. Moreover, VBM analysis showed a larger GM volume for JD relative to the NC group in the right middle occipital cortex, most profoundly in the chronic phase. JD's performance serves as a first glance of tactile enumeration in acalculia. Pattern-recognition-based results support the suggestion of subitizing being the enumeration process when using one hand. Moreover, the increase in GM in the occipital cortex lays the groundwork for studying the innate and primitive ability to perceive and evaluate sizes or amounts-""sense of magnitude""- as a multisensory magnitude area and as part of a recovery path for deficits in basic numerical abilities.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2018.10.001,,Acalculia; Embodied numerosity; Sense of magnitude; Subitizing; Tactile enumeration; VBM analysis,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
37478549,White matter tract disconnection in Gerstmann's syndrome: Insights from a single case study.,"Ranzini, Mariagrazia; Ferrazzi, Giulio; D'Imperio, Daniela; Giustiniani, Andreina; Danesin, Laura; D'Antonio, Valentina; Rigon, Elena; Cacciante, Luisa; Rigon, Jessica; Meneghello, Francesca; Turolla, Andrea; Vallesi, Antonino; Semenza, Carlo; Burgio, Francesca",Ranzini,"It has been suggested that Gerstmann's syndrome is the result of subcortical disconnection rather than emerging from damage of a multifunctional brain region within the parietal lobe. However, patterns of white matter tract disconnection following parietal damage have been barely investigated. This single case study allows characterising Gerstmann's syndrome in terms of disconnected networks. We report the case of a left parietal patient affected by Gerstmann's tetrad: agraphia, acalculia, left/right orientation problems, and finger agnosia. Lesion mapping, atlas-based estimation of probability of disconnection, and DTI-based tractography revealed that the lesion was mainly located in the superior parietal lobule, and it caused disruption of both intraparietal tracts passing through the inferior parietal lobule (e.g., tracts connecting the angular, supramarginal, postcentral gyri, and the superior parietal lobule) and fronto-parietal long tracts (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus). The lesion site appears to be located more superiorly as compared to the cerebral regions shown active by other studies during tasks impaired in the syndrome, and it reached the subcortical area potentially critical in the emergence of the syndrome, as hypothesised in previous studies. Importantly, the reconstruction of tracts connecting regions within the parietal lobe indicates that this critical subcortical area is mainly crossed by white matter tracts connecting the angular gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. Taken together, these findings suggest that this case study might be considered as empirical evidence of Gerstmann's tetrad caused by disconnection of intraparietal white matter tracts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.05.016,,Gerstmann's syndrome; Lesion Mapping; Optic ataxia; White matter tract disconnection; stroke,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

It is recognized that cortical damage (i.e. focal lesions and atrophy) plays a role in determining the accumulation of physical and cognitive disability that is observed in patients with progressive MS. To date, an association of cortical lesions with clinical relapses has not been described. We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of five relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who had clinical relapses characterized by the acute appearance of cortical symptoms, due to the development of large, snake-like, cortical inflammatory lesions. Symptoms were: acute Wernicke's aphasia mimicking stroke; agraphia with acalculia, not associated to a motor deficit nor linguistic disturbance; hyposthenia of the left arm, followed by muscle twitching of the hand, spreading to arm and face; acute onset of left lower limb paroxysmal hypertonia; and temporal lobe status epilepticus, with psychotic symptoms. Cortical relapses may occur in MS. MRI examination in MS should include sequences, such as double inversion recovery (DIR) or phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR), that are aimed at visualizing cortical lesions, especially in the presence of symptoms of cortical dysfunction. Our observation further stresses and extends the clinical relevance of cortical pathology in MS.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",10.1177/1352458514564483,,Case study; cortical lesions; grey matter; inversion recovery; magnetic resonance imaging; multiple sclerosis; relapse; relapse symptoms; relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
29936013,Acute stroke presenting with isolated acalculia.,"Grimaldi, Michael; Jeanmonod, Rebecca",Grimaldi,"Acalculia is defined as the inability to mentally manipulate numbers for simple calculations. It may occur in dementia, central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm, and stroke (Bermejo-Velasco and Castillo-Moreno, 2006). Lesions of the left parietal cortex are the principal cause. When acalculia occurs in stroke, it is generally associated with other deficits in speech, sensation, or motor function. We report the case of a 63-year-old male with a 1 day history of isolated acalculia that was found to have a left parietal lobe infarct with several smaller infarcts in the left occipital lobe.

29681826,Frontal Phonological Agraphia and Acalculia with Impaired Verbal Short-Term Memory due to Left Inferior Precentral Gyrus Lesion.,"Sakurai, Yasuhisa; Furukawa, Emi; Kurihara, Masanori; Sugimoto, Izumi",Sakurai,"We report a patient with phonological agraphia (selective impairment of kana [Japanese phonetic writing] nonwords) and acalculia (mental arithmetic difficulties) with impaired verbal short-term memory after a cerebral hemorrhage in the opercular part of the left precentral gyrus (Brodmann area 6) and the adjacent postcentral gyrus. The patient showed phonemic paragraphia in five-character kana nonword writing, minimal acalculia, and reduced digit and letter span. Mental arithmetic normalized after 8 months and agraphia recovered to the normal range at 1 year after onset, in parallel with an improvement of the auditory letter span score from 4 to 6 over a period of 14 months and in the digit span score from 6 to 7 over 24 months. These results suggest a close relationship between the recovery of agraphia and acalculia and the improvement of verbal short-term memory. The present case also suggests that the opercular part of the precentral gyrus constitutes the phonological route in writing that conveys phonological information of syllable sequences, and its damage causes phonological agraphia and acalculia with reduced verbal short-term memory.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000487849,PMC5903121,Acalculia; Frontal pure agraphia; Phonological agraphia; Verbal short-term memory; Working memory,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We herein describe a man with dystypia with agraphia due to infarction of the left angular gyrus. His dystypia seemed to result from the convergence failure of the kana into the alphabetical spellings. During dystypia, hypoperfusion of the bilateral middle frontal cortices was discovered. However, after his symptoms improved, blood flow in the middle frontal cortices returned to normal. This case suggests that the middle frontal cortex is downstream of the angular gyrus in the dictating pathway and a lesion in the left middle frontal cortex could cause pure dystypia.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105803,,Angular gyrus; Diaschisis; Dystypia; Middle frontal gyrus,Case Reports,United States,eng
16916525,"Acalculia from a right hemisphere lesion dealing with ""where"" in multiplication procedures.","Granà, Alessia; Hofer, Riccardo; Semenza, Carlo",Granà,"The present study describes in detail, for the first time, a case of failure with multiplication procedures in a right hemisphere damaged patient (PN). A careful, step-by-step, error analysis made possible to show that an important portion of PN's errors could be better explained as spatial in nature and specifically related to the demands of a multi-digit multiplication. These errors can be distinguished from other types of errors, including those, expected after a right hemisphere lesion, determined by a generic inability to deal with spatial material, or from other deficits, like neglect, affecting cognitive capacities across the board. The best explanation for PN's problems is that he might have difficulties in relying on a visuo-spatial store containing a layout representation specific to multiplication. As a consequence, while knowing what, when and how to carry out the various steps, PN does not know where. What he may thus lack is a spatial schema of multiplication. Such schema is thought to help normal calculators in overcoming working memory demands of complex calculation by representing the information of where exactly each sub-step should be placed.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.06.027,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The present study investigates the involvement of the IPS in estimating the results of multi-digit multiplication problems. For this purpose, the performance a 24-year-old female (JD) with brain damage in the left IPS was compared to an age-matched control group in the computation estimation task. When required to estimate whether the results of multi-digit multiplication problems are smaller or larger than given reference numbers, JD, in contrast to controls, did not show the common patterns of distance and size effects. Her strategy use was also atypical. Most control participants used both the approximated calculation strategy that involves rounding and calculation procedures and the sense of magnitude strategy that relies on an intuitive approximated magnitude representation of the results. In contrast, JD used only the former but not the latter strategy. Together, these findings suggest that the damage to the IPS impaired JD's representations of magnitude that play an important role in this computation estimation task.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neuroscience,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.05.006,,IPS; acalculia; computation estimation; sense of magnitude,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The patients' difficulties, which were not associated with a general intellectual deterioration, and those affecting number processing as a particular semantic class, were indicative of a ""global acalculia"". This deficit, which exceeded the anarithmetia usually described in Gerstmann syndrome following left IPL lesion, suggested that the isolation of this area may constitute a sufficient condition for producing such a global acalculia.

The syndrome is caused primarily by lesions at the confluence of parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, but also can involve the middle frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere. Documented inciting lesions include stroke, tumor, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, and seizures.

On exam, he was found to have a right inferior quadrantanopia, grade II papilledema and demonstrated all four symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome - inability to perform simple calculations (acalculia), or identify his fingers (finger agnosia), could not distinguish his left side from the right (left-right disorientation), nor write out his name (agraphia).

Compared to matched controls, AD showed a larger distance effect in numerical comparisons, an abnormal size congruity indicated by a lack of facilitation by irrelevant numerical values in physical comparisons, a deficiency in counting in comparison tasks, and a deficiency in subitizing in number naming tasks and comparison tasks. This suggests that the underlying deficit in AD is a difficulty in the perception and manipulation of quantity. Moreover, it indicates the essential role of the IPS in basic numerical processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2007.08.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Clinical symptoms and lesions on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often disappear in 1 week or a few weeks. However, MERS manifesting as a severe clinical course with significant sequela has not yet been reported. A 42-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of headache, fever, and irrational speech. Physical examination showed a body temperature of 39.5°C, dysarthria, dyscalculia, recent memory disturbance, and otherwise normal vital signs. The patient developed status epilepticus and progressive consciousness disturbance. MRI showed abnormal patchy signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The clinical feature and the characteristic of MRI are mostly consistent with MERS. At the same time, we made a differential diagnosis by testing the NMDARAb, AMPA1Ab, AMPA2Ab, LG1Ab, CASPR2Ab, GABABRAb in CSF and serum. The subject was treated with ganciclovir, antiepileptic, and antipyretic therapy. The subject was living a virtually normal life with persistent mild memory disturbance. MRI showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had disappeared, but hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR imaging was noted in the centrum semiovale.

On closer analysis, however, distinct deficits were found. The subcortical case suffered from a selective deficit of rote verbal knowledge, including but not limited to arithmetic tables, while her semantic knowledge of numerical quantities was intact. Conversely the inferior parietal case suffered from a category-specific impairment of quantitative numerical knowledge, particularly salient in subtraction and number bissection tasks, with preserved knowledge of rote arithmetic facts. This double dissociation suggests that numerical knowledge is processed in different formats within distinct cerebral pathways.

In contrast, her ability to manipulate non-verbal representations of numbers, i.e., Arabic numerals and quantities, was comparatively well preserved, as evidenced for instance in number comparison or number bisection tasks. This dissociated impairment of verbal and non-verbal numerical abilities entailed a differential impairment of the four arithmetic operations. ATH performed much better with subtraction and addition, that can be solved on the basis of quantity manipulation, than with multiplication and division problems, that are commonly solved by retrieving stored verbal sequences. The brain lesion affected the classical language areas, but spared a subset of the left inferior parietal lobule that was active during calculation tasks, as demonstrated with functional MRI. Finally, the relative preservation of subtraction versus multiplication may be related to the fact that subtraction activated the intact right parietal lobe, while multiplication activated predominantly left-sided areas.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(00)00038-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The study focused on one case of early brain injury that resulted in both dyscalculia and dyslexia. Brain injury was studied using both structural and fMRI. Intellectual function was evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, while visuospatial skills were assessed using the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, and Judgment of Line Orientation subtest. The Selective Reminding Test and the Recurring Figures Test were used to evaluate memory and orientation; language and speech skills were evaluated using the Boston Naming Test, Controlled Oral Word Association, Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, and color naming.

Standardized tests of arithmetic and reading supplemented by an assessment of calculation and quantitative skills. While performing calculations, fMRI disclosed predominantly left hemisphere activation involving the frontal and posterior parietal regions, whereas this task produced bilateral activation of the supramarginal gyrus in seven of nine normal subjects. Neuropsychological findings confirmed the presence of dyscalculia and dyslexia despite normal intellectual functioning. Visuospatial skills ranged from the low normal to average level. The fMRI findings were consistent with early interhemispheric transfer of visuospatial skills normally committed to the right parietal area to the left parietal region. The patient's dyscalculia and reading ability raise a question of acquired left parietal dysfunction as a consequence of the competition between verbal and visuospatial functions for left hemisphere representation.

Gerstmann's syndrome is a combination of disorientation for left and right, finger agnosia, and profound agraphia, alexia, and acalculia. It is due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus, situated at the confluence of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report on a patient who suffered from severe underdiagnosed eclampsia and who developed bilateral extensive medial temporal, parietal, and calcarine ischemic infarctions during an eclamptic fit. In addition, ischemia destroyed the left angular gyrus. The combination of these lesions led to Gerstmann's syndrome with additional cortical agnosia and cortical diplopia. For the first few months following the ischemic insult, the patient had been cortically blind. Thereafter, the patient slowly regained a visual acuity of 0.1 in both eyes. She then experienced monocular and binocular diplopia. Her ocular motility was normal; there was no phoria or tropia. Monocular and binocular diplopia slowly became less severe over the following year. Now, 2 years after the incident, the patient has a visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes and no double vision. However, the handicapping symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome, which make leading a normal life impossible, have persisted--the patient still cannot cope alone, mainly due to the severe disorientation for left and right. The picture of cortical agnosia, cortical diplopia, and Gerstmann's syndrome is a very rare combination.

Although the effects of LITT have been modeled in vivo, the histologic effects in a clinical circumstance have not been described. We analyzed tissue from a patient who underwent LITT as primary treatment for GBM. A 62-year-old male was diagnosed with a left temporal GBM and underwent LITT at an outside institution. Despite corticosteroid therapy, the patient was referred with increasing headache and acalculia associated with progressive peritumoral edema two weeks after LITT procedure. En bloc resection of the enhancing lesion and adjacent temporal lobe was performed with steroid-independent symptom resolution (follow-up, > 2 years). Histologic analysis revealed three distinct histologic zones concentrically radiating from the center of the treatment site. An acellular central region of necrosis (Zone 1) was surrounded by a rim of granulation tissue with macrophages (CD68) (Zone 2; mean thickness, 1.3 ± 0.3 mm [±S.D.]). Viable tumor cells (identified by Ki-67, p53 and Olig2 immunohistochemistry) were found (Zone 3) immediately adjacent to granulation tissue. The histologic volume of thermal tissue ablation/granulation was consistent with preoperative (pre-resection) magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging. These findings are the first in vivo in humans to reveal that LITT causes a defined pattern of tissue necrosis, concentric destruction of tumor and tissue with viable tumor cells just beyond the zones of central necrosis and granulation. Furthermore, MR-imaging appears to be an accurate surrogate of tissue/tumor ablation in the early period (2 weeks) post-LITT treatment.

Our patient was a 66-year-old female with diabetes mellitus who suddenly developed right hemichorea, mild muscle weakness of the right upper extremity, ideational apraxia, and acalculia. Her blood glucose was 600 mg/dL, and HbA1c was 13.3%. After the patient underwent head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a new cerebral infarction was observed in the left frontal lobe, and treatment was started with edaravone and cilostazol. At the same time, insulin treatment was also started for hyperglycemia. The acalculia and ideational apraxia improved approximately 1 week after treatment initiated, and the hemichorea also decreased. ECD-SPECT was performed on admission, and it was observed that blood flow was decreased in the left frontal lobe and striatum, but increased in the thalamus; two weeks later on follow-up ECD-SPECT, blood flow had increased slightly in the left forebrain and striatum, while it had decreased slightly in the thalamus.

When the activity of the pallidum is impaired, it is presumed that the inhibitory activity towards the thalamus weakens and the thalamic cells become over-excited, causing chorea.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,10.1016/j.jcma.2013.12.004,,ECD-SPECT; cerebral infarction; diabetes mellitus; hemichorea; regional cerebral blood flow,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

He suggested that it is a disorder of the body schema restricted to the hand and fingers. The existence of a Grundstörung has since been contested. Here we suggest that a common psychoneurological factor does exist, but should be related to transformations of mental images rather than to the body schema. A patient (H.P.) was studied, who presented the four symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome in the absence of any other neuropsychological disorders. MRI showed a focal ischaemic lesion, situated subcortically in the inferior part of the left angular gyrus and reaching the superior posterior region of T1. The cortical layers were spared and the lesion was seen to extend to the callosal fibres. On the basis of an extensive cognitive investigation, language, praxis, memory and intelligence disorders were excluded. The four remaining symptoms (finger agnosia, agraphia, right-left disorientation and dyscalculia) were investigated thoroughly with the aim of determining any characteristics that they might share. Detailed analyses of the tetrad showed that the impairment was consistently attributable to disorders of a spatial nature. Furthermore, cognitive tests necessitating mental rotation were equally shown to be impaired, confirming the essentially visuospatial origin of the disturbance.

General physical examination showed no remarkable abnormalities except for bruit at the left mastoid process. Although his time orientation was poor, he was otherwise fully awake. Neurologically, memory disturbance, finger agnosia, and dyscalculia were observed. Right Barré's sign, and exaggerated right patellar tendon reflex were observed.

Here we report the case of a 58-year-old right-handed man who suffered from an inability to perform calculations following right putaminal hemorrhage.

Our patient applied the commutative law of multiplication and ordinal number line etc. to compensate for his deficit. Such compensation with preserved conceptual knowledge has also been previously reported in Western patients. Moreover, our patient did not make any errors when the first operand of the Kuku was 5. Sparing of multiplication errors when the first operand is 5 has been reported in another Japanese case study on acalculia as well as in studies of healthy Japanese children; however, this has never been reported in Western studies.

The presence of both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and scleromyxedema in a patient with encephalopathy led us to compare the clinical symptoms and the different possible mechanisms accounting for the pathology. We describe the case of a 54-year-old male who was admitted to hospital because of several occurrences of transient neurological focus that finally developed into a clinical picture of aphasia, acalculia and right homonymous hemianopsia. The patient had previously been diagnosed as suffering from scleromyxedema, which responded poorly to treatment, as well as IgG kappa paraproteinemia and, six months before admission to hospital, Hashimoto's thyroiditis. No abnormalities were found in the complementary tests, except for slightly high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, a diffuse slowing of brain waves in the electroencephalogram and alterations due to thyroiditis and paraproteinemia. Neurological symptoms improved after a few days of corticoid therapy. The presentation of encephalopathy as a stroke and its excellent response to treatment with corticoids pointed to a case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of it being a dermato-neuro syndrome, which is associated to scleromyxedema. In this paper we review the different pathological mechanisms proposed for the two clinical entities, as well as the clinical features that are similar in both syndromes and which could be an indication of some common mechanism shared by them.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
18067427,Measurement of recovery after traumatic brain injury: a cognitive-neuropsychological comparison of the WAIS-R with the cognitive assessment system (CAS) in a single case of atypical language lateralization.,"McCrea, Simon M",McCrea,"A 20-year-old preferentially left-handed male suffered an extensive right, focal, medial, prefrontal hematoma and contusion with associated swelling, and an initially undetected progressive loss of consciousness following trauma to the forehead. Performance on the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) at 1 and 6 months after traumatic brain injury was compared with performance on the WAIS-R at 6 months post-injury. The patient demonstrated significant residualized impairment on selected subtests of the CAS at 6 months post-injury (all ps < 0.05). The patient was also significantly impaired on the Information, Vocabulary, Arithmetic and Comprehension verbal subtests of the WAIS-R. The magnitude of these WAIS-R subtest discrepancies occurred with a low base rate (< 1%) in the WAIS-R standardization sample. In addition there was a significant VIQ versus PIQ discrepancy favouring PIQ of a magnitude occurring in less than 5% of the WAIS-R standardization sample. These findings could not be explained on the basis of any prior learning disability, poor educational opportunities, medication use, response bias, confabulation, or low level of general ability. The low scores on the verbal subtests of the WAIS-R in conjunction with the impairment on the CAS subtests are highly suggestive of lasting frontal-executive dysfunction in this patient. Incidental findings of persisting anomia, impaired processing of proverbs, acalculia, and fluctuating verbal attention, as well as impaired retrieval of verbal information in the context of intact PIQ and superior constructional praxis suggest some degree of bilateral representation of linguistic functions. The differential assessment of cognitive domains by these two instruments as well as theoretical concordance in the pattern of results is also addressed.",{},,Applied neuropsychology,10.1080/09084280701719419,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Patients with ""memory"" disturbances reported in the literature present left parietal lesions, while ""monitoring"" impairments have been assumed to be due to frontal damage. Procedural knowledge has been less investigated in basal ganglia lesions, in which there has been no analysis of procedural impairments. The present study investigates and compares the patterns of acalculia in two patients, one with a left parietal lesion and the other with a left basal ganglia lesion. The patients were tested on a broad range of neuropsychological abilities, with the main focus on number processing and calculation. The results show many similarities between their deficits, with some difficulties in simple arithmetic, arithmetical rules and mental and written complex calculations. The errors made in complex mental and written calculations were due to memory-based procedural impairments in both patients. These findings, corroborated with other studies reported in the literature, suggest the existence of a fronto-parieto-subcortical circuit responsible for arithmetic complex calculations and that procedural knowledge relies on a visuo-spatial sketchpad that contains a representation of each sub-step of the procedure.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2009.09.033,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The approach was studied in two cadaver brains and three asymptomatic patients with trigonal meningiomas. The posterior part of the sylvian fissure, or superior temporal sulcus, is opened to the bottom. Through a small horizontal cortical incision, the trigone of the lateral ventricle is exposed in the shortest distance. The trigonal meningiomas are detached from the choroid plexus and removed. In patients with meningiomas on the nondominant side, the transsylvian approach was adopted. In patients with meningiomas on the dominant side, the transsylvian approach was adopted for patients with a wide sylvian cistern, and the approach through the superior temporal sulcus was adopted for patients with a narrow sylvian cistern. The transverse gyrus of Heschl was a good anatomic landmark in the operative field of the transsylvian approach. Patients with meningiomas on the dominant side exhibited transient amnestic aphasia and dyscalculia, but the symptoms disappeared in a few days or weeks. These patients were discharged without any neurological deficits. Although there are potential risks of damaging association fibers, optic radiation, the transverse gyrus of Heschl, and the parietal lobe, a thorough understanding of the topographical anatomy and careful dissection techniques can avoid morbidity. Wide opening of the sylvian fissure and debulking of the tumor are other important factors to reduce the retraction of the parietal and temporal lobes. The lateral transsulcal approach is applicable for small asymptomatic trigonal meningiomas with an acceptable risk of morbidity, even in the dominant hemisphere.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1227/01.neu.0000156553.94932.dd,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

About 2 hours after trauma, these neurological deficits improved dramatically. CT scan on admission revealed no abnormal finding. But, on the next day, CT scan revealed an irregular low density area at the left basal ganglia. Cerebral angiography showed a slight narrowing at the left carotid siphon, severe stenosis at M1 portion of the left middle cerebral artery with vasospasm of its distal branches and occlusion of the left anterior temporal artery. The extracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery was intact. Clinically, the patient recovered from the right hemiparesis almost fully and was discharged after 1 month with mild dyscalculia. Three months later, follow-up angiography disclosed stenosis of the left M1 portion but the narrowing of the carotid siphon and vasospasm of the peripheral branches of the middle cerebral artery had been normalized, and the anterior temporal artery was recanalized. The pathogenesis of the occlusion is classified into 4 causes, 1) embolism from internal carotid artery, 2) vasospasm, 3) thrombus formation, 4) dissection. However, the demonstration of this by angiography is difficult. In our case, the injury of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery, which caused the intimal injury, spasm or thrombus formation, might have happened and resulted in embolisation and recanalization of the middle cerebral artery.",{},,No shinkei geka.

No other apraxia, unilateral spatial neglect or extinction phenomena were observed. An MRI demonstrated resected areas in the right superior frontal gyrus, subcortical region in the right middle frontal gyrus, anterior part of the cingulate gyrus, a part of supplementary motor area. Surrounding area in the right frontal lobe showed diffuse signal change. She demonstrated non-fluent aprosodic speech with word finding difficulty. No phonemic paraphasia, or anarthria was observed. Auditory comprehension was fair with some difficulty in comprehending complex commands. Naming was good, but verbal fluency tests for a category or phonemic cuing was severely impaired. She could repeat words but not sentences. Reading comprehension was disturbed by semantic paralexia and writing words was poor for both Kana (syllabogram) and Kanji(logogram) characters. A significant feature of her speech was mitigated echolalia. In both free conversation and examination setting, she often repeated phrases spoken to her which she used to start her speech. In addition, she repeated words spoken to others which were totally irrelevant to her conversation. She was aware of her echoing, which always embarrassed her. She described her echolalic tendency as a great nuisance. However, once echoing being forbidden, she could not initiate her speech and made incorrect responses after long delay. Thus, her compulsive echolalia helped to start her speech. Only four patients with crossed aphasia demonstrated echolalia in the literature. They showed severe aphasia with markedly decreased speech and severe comprehension deficit. A patient with a similar lesion in the right medial frontal lobe had aspontaneity in general and language function per se could not be examined properly. Echolalia related to the medial frontal lesion in the language dominant hemisphere was described as a compulsive speech response, because some other 'echoing' phenomena or compulsive behavior were also observed in these patients. On the other hand, some patients with a large lesion in the right hemisphere tended to respond to stimuli directed to other patients, so called 'response-to-next-patient-stimulation'. This behavior was explained by disinhibited shift of attention or perseveration of the set. Both compulsive speech responses and 'response-to-next-patient-stimulation' like phenomena may have contributed to the echolalia phenomena of the present case.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

In addition, there was a pronounced sequential movement copying disorder, reduced short-term verbal memory and acalculia. In general, the patient's sign errors showed a consistent disruption in the structure of ASL signs which parallels the speech errors of oral aphasic patients. We conclude that most aphasic symptoms are not modality-dependent, but rather reflect a disruption of linguistic processes common to all human languages.

Although he was able to orient attention in the contralesional space, he had a persistent personal neglect disorder with severe difficulty in attending to his own body.

However, SPECT showed hyperaccumulation of 99m Tc-HM-PAO in the right temporal-occipital area. On the 5th hospital day, he became comatose. CSF study revealed marked pleocytosis. Even then, MRI including Gd-enhanced study was normal while SPECT continued to show hyperaccumulation. Detection of herpes simplex virus DNA in CSF by polymerase chain reaction was negative. Anti-HSV antibody titer in CSF and serum confirmed intrathecal production of the antibody on the 14th hospital day. Abnormal accumulation of tracer in SPECT returned to normal on the 31st day when he was alert but still had a mild Gerstman syndrome. Case 2 was a 61-year-old man with disturbance of consciousness, mental dysfunction, and generalized convulsion. He was diagnosed as having HSVE by means of CSF pleocytosis, detection of HSV DNA in CSF by polymerase chain reaction, and presence of anti-HSV antibody in the CSF. CT and MRI again revealed no abnormality while SPECT clearly showed hyperaccumulation in the left temporal lobe in an early stage. Hyperaccumulation of lipophilic tracer on SPECT study, especially in the temporal lobes, has been reported in the early stage of HSVE by previous investigators. Unlike MRI or enhanced CT, the increased tracer accumulation in SPECT does not reflect disruption of the blood-brain-barrier or inflammatory edema, but reflects hyperperfusion or some other HSVE related abnormality which is currently unknown. From these observations, we suggest that local hyperperfusion occurs before local inflammation, and that SPECT is the most useful scanning method for early diagnosis of HSVE when this disease is clinically suspected.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
1802471,[A case of anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome associated with subdural hematoma].,"Ohnishi, M; Tokuda, T; Hashimoto, T; Yanagisawa, N; Kato, M",Ohnishi,"We report a case of a 47-year-old man with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome associated with subdural hematoma. The patient had several episodes of arthritis during his thirties. He developed venous thrombosis in his right lower leg at the age of 35, when laboratory studies demonstrated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a biological false-positive result occurred on a syphilis test. When bulbar palsy and Horner's syndrome in the right eye suddenly appeared at the age of 42, he was diagnosed as having brain stem infarction. At the age of 47, he developed constructional apraxia, dyscalculia, skilled movement disturbances and generalized convulsions. Subdural hematoma and multiple lacunes in the cerebral white matter were demonstrated with brain MRI. Furthermore, the patient was positive for Rumpel-Leede phenomenon. Laboratory studies revealed mild thrombocytopenia, prolonged bleeding time and APTT, positive antinuclear antibody and positive test results for both lupus anticoagulant and an anti-cardiolipin antibody, namely anti-phospholipid antibodies. Based on these findings, we consider that the tendency of this patient to bleed may have been due to antiphospholipid antibodies, attacking the platelet membranes and that the bridging veins in the subdural space may be the site at which the bleeding tendency easily appears. Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome accompanied by hemorrhagic complications had rarely been reported. We suggest that special attention should be given to hemorrhagic complications in patients with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome associated with fragility of the vessels and/or platelet dysfunction.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
11788743,"Gerstmann syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus: neuropsychological, neuroimaging and spectroscopic findings.","Jung, R E; Yeo, R A; Sibbitt, W L; Ford, C C; Hart, B L; Brooks, W M",Jung,"Gerstmann syndrome (GS) comprises four interlaced neuropsychological symptoms including finger agnosia, right-left confusion, agraphia, and acalculia. While GS is commonly associated with focal lesions to the region of the left angular gyrus, it has also been associated with numerous diffuse etiologies including atrophy, alcoholism, carbon monoxide poisoning, lead intoxication and anaphylactic shock. Thus, a vigorous debate has emerged as to whether GS represents a syndrome arising from general brain decline or a distinct and localizing lesion. We report a right-handed patient who developed neuropsychological dysfunction secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Neuropsychological evaluation found the patient to exhibit symptoms consistent with the GS tetrad, as well as general cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a distinct focal lesion of the left parieto-occipital white matter underlying the angular gyrus as well as diffuse atrophy. (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed substantial metabolic derangement in a voxel placed within the visible lesion, although substantial metabolic derangement was observed in regions remote from the focal pathology. Thus, GS in this first case in SLE would appear to comprise a focal neurological tetrad of disorders within a more general pattern of cognitive decline and metabolic derangement.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.6.515,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

The drug withdrawal induced a quick improvement of mental function. In this case, hyperammonemia, hypocarnitinemia, increased protein in cerebrospinal fluid were found. When the drug was discontinued, she had a dramatic improvement. Valproic acid caused encephalopathy because of metabolic abnormality in mitochondria in this case. In the cases of encephalopathy caused by valproic acid, the drug administration should be withdrawn, and appropriate measures had to be taken. In addition, elevation of ammonia in the blood, lactic acid and pyruic acid in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and decreased carnitine level in the serum will be useful to make a diagnosis of valproate-induced encephalopathy.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

During his driving car traffic accident happened due to his right homonymous hemianopsia. On the 1st admission, neurological examination revealed choked disc(1 D.), hemianopsia, memory disturbance, dyscalculia, dyslexia and dysgraphia. The angiograms showed feeding arteries from left middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery. Tumor vessels looked like cork-screw in the arterial phase and homogeneous tumor shadow was depicted in late venous phase. Contrast enhancement CT scan revealed a nodular homogeneous high dense lesion on the occipital region. Hemorrhage during every craniotomy was too much to remove and at last metastasized to left II rib and right VIII rib and right radius. Their histological examination reveals numerous endothelial-lined vascular channels and atypia of tumor cells with mitoses.

6648195,[Agraphia and preservation of music writing in a bilingual piano teacher].,"Assal, G; Buttet, J",Assal,"A bilingual virtuoso piano teacher developed aphasia and amusia, probably due to cerebral embolism. The perfectly demarcated and unique lesion was located in the left posterior temporoparietal region. Language examinations in French and Italian demonstrated entirely comparable difficulties in both languages. The linguistic course was favorable after a period of auditory agnosia and global aphasia. Language became fluent again 3 months after the onset, with a marked vocabulary loss and phonemic paraphasias with attempts at self-correction. Repetition was altered markedly with a deficit in auditory comprehension but no remaining elements of auditory agnosia. Reading was possible, but with some difficulty and total agraphia and acalculia persisted. Musical ability was better conserved, particularly with respect to repetition and above all to writing, the sparing of the latter constituting a fairly uncommon dissociation in relation to agraphia. Findings are discussed in relation to data in the literature concerning hemispheric participation in various musical tasks.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Two patients presenting this disturbance as the only source of their calculating errors are reported. Neither aphasia nor visuo-verbal disconnection could explain the failure to identify the arithmetical signs. This defect is interpreted as an alexia for this particular semiotic system, the arithmetical signs being stripped of their names and of the corresponding computational rules.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(80)80032-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
1380676,[A case of malignant glioma associated with verbal recent memory disturbance due to left hippocampal atrophy; case report].,"Aradachi, H; Yamashima, T; Tuchida, A; Noguchi, Y; Kubota, T",Aradachi,"Verbal recent memory disturbance was observed in a patient with a malignant glioma associated with left hippocampal atrophy. A 25 year-old male was admitted because of seizures. CT scan and MRI showed enhanced mass lesions in the left temporal lobe associated with ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy. Neurological examination disclosed right homonymous hemianopsia, word amnesia, alexia, agraphia and acalculia. Neuropsychological examination disclosed verbal recent memory disturbance, which consisted of impaired recall of the precisely memorized words after some interruption. Although hippocampal lesions are known to be often associated with cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal atrophy due to brain tumor is quite unusual. This case suggested that the left hippocampus is closely related to verbal recent memory. Hippocampal atrophy in this case conceivably derived from the decreased arterial flow due to perifocal edema or obstructive hydrocephalus.",{},,No shinkei geka.

17106828,[Korsakoff's syndrome secondary to left thalamic bleeding].,"Bermejo Velasco, P E; Ruiz Huete, C",Bermejo Velasco,"Korsakoff's syndrome is characterised by an important impairment in memory in comparison to other cognitive functions. Presence of confabulations is frequent but they are not characteristic of this syndrome. Alcohol abuse is the main cause of this syndrome but it also has been associated to other causes, like malnutrition or structural lesions. Although the role of thalamus in memory processing is well established, the development of confabulations in the setting of a thalamic lesion is poorly described in the literature. We present a 61 year-old hypertensive man, with an important impairment in anterograde memory, confabulations and acalculia after a left thalamic haemorrhage. Other cognitive functions were intact except a partial temporal disorientation. Thalamic dementia is generally caused by bilateral thalamic damage. Usually, all cognitive functions are impaired. As thalamus takes part in Papez's circuit, either thalamic nuclei or their connections lesions may originate memory impairment. However, although a relation between the presence of confabulations and connections from thalamus to frontal lobe lesions has been described, there is almost no evidence in the literature.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
