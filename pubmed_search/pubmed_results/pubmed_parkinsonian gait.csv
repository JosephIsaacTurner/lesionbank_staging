34334283,Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"Salehi, Parnia; Clark, Mark; Pinzon, Jeffer; Patil, Abhijit",Salehi,"Being considered among the most fatal neurological conditions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy characterized by its unknown etiology and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative symptoms that often lead to a mean survival of 6 to 12 months. The accumulation of the prionic protein causes brain matter degeneration, which leads to a set of clinical findings that include rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, tremors, cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. This clinical presentation is non-specific, which makes CJD a very difficult condition to diagnose, due to the low level of clinical suspicion. However, combining this clinical presentation with neuroimaging, a lumbar puncture and an encephalogram will help us make the correct diagnosis. We present the case of a 57-year-old male presenting to the Emergency department with complaint of personality change and intermittent memory loss. The patient's physical exam was significant for resting pill roll tremor, bilateral cogwheel rigidity, dysmetria, and shuffling gait. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed symmetric bilateral diffusion signal abnormality involving the cortex, bilateral caudate heads and putamina. Continuous electroencephalogram revealed multiple bifrontal delta discharges with triphasic morphology. Lumbar puncture was significant for presence of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid. The multiple examinations performed in conjunction with the previous findings supported the diagnosis of acute encephalopathy secondary to sporadic CJD.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.07.038,,Creutzfeldt-jakob disease; Neurology; Parkinsonism,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
35711403,Neurosyphilis: A Monkey Among Men.,"Rowe, Cameron; Buckley, Nathan; Chhetri, Bhaskar; Paudel, Suresh",Rowe,"Neurosyphilis is the progression of the untreated sexually transmitted infection caused by <i>Treponema pallidum</i>. When the initial infection is not adequately treated, progression of primary syphilis can lead to a wide variety of serious health sequelae. While neurosyphilis can appear up to 10-30 years after the initial infection, syphilis can invade the nervous systemat any stage of infection and can imitate symptoms of many other diseases. This variety of symptoms is why syphilis has been called ""The Great Pretender"" or ""Themonkey among diseases""(Krämer et al., 2018).12 This is a case report of an 83-year-old female with a history of multiple TIAs, dementia, and breast cancer who presented to the emergency department with complaints of her head ""not feeling right"" and intermittent ataxia (episodes of imbalance and difficulty ambulating) reported by patient and patients' son. Physical exam only pertinent for chronic shuffling gait, but no ataxia. The patient underwent further work-up, demonstrating negative brain imaging for cerebral vascular accident and laboratory findings negative initially, for acute infection. An RPR was drawn as part of an broadened altered mental status workup as the patient and family stated she was not back to baseline mental status and was positive with a quantitative titer of 1:8. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ab) was found to be positive as well. The patient was started on three million units intravenous Penicillin G every 4 h and was discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter in order to receive two weeks of Rocephin at two grams daily. Patient returned to prior baseline following completion of treatment. Through this case, we hope to provide information on neurosyphilis and its differentiation from other disease processes and when neurosyphilis should be suspected during an evaluation of altered mental status.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,10.55729/2000-9666.1055,PMC9195079,FTA-ab; Neurology; Neurosyphilis; Primary syphilis; Secondary syphilis; Syphilis; Tertiary syphilis; Treponema; Treponema pallidum,Case Reports,United States,eng

Based on the neural localization and multiple head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, a diagnosis of cerebral infarction (vertebrobasilar system) was made. Consequently, the patient was managed using therapy aimed at preventing platelet aggregation, lowering plasma lipids, stabilizing plaques, protecting mitochondria, and improving circulation and brain function. The patient's gait improved and she was discharged after 14 days because she was able to walk unaided.

Isolated central nervous system (CNS) metastasis arising from urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a rare presentation yielding a poor prognosis. A 71-year-old male patient with a history of urothelial carcinoma, treated one year prior with partial cystectomy and adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) therapy, presented with worsening neurological symptoms, including progressively worsening dizziness, shuffling gait, drifting, expressive aphasia, and confusion. MRI revealed a left frontal 4.0 x 3.6 cm brightly contrast-enhancing tumor with possible hemorrhage, extensive vasogenic edema, and moderate mass effect. An additional smaller right cerebellar lesion was also noted. Outpatient CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no evidence of other malignant sites. He ultimately underwent a left craniotomy with a total resection of his left frontal mass. Pathological examination revealed a urothelial primary. Post-operative MRI revealed complete resection of the left frontal mass and the patient was discharged with no neurologic deficits on exam. In many cases, brain metastases may present years later following initial therapy of UC as the CNS may act as a sanctuary site during systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine with better penetration of the blood-brain barrier may be beneficial in delaying the onset of these metastases.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.27587,PMC9433789,cerebral metastasis; isolated brain metastasis; metastatic brain tumors; neurosurgery oncology; transitional cell carcinoma; urothelial malignancy,Case Reports,United States,eng

Thus, the exact location of frontal lesion responsible for a specific gait disturbance is not well defined. We describe a 47-year-old man who experienced two episodes of paroxysmal freezing of gait of the right leg. During the attacks, he had no motor weakness, sensory change, or disequilibrium. He had past history of panic attacks. Recently, he had been under severe emotional stress. T2 and diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were normal. So far, the most likely clinical diagnosis might be functional freezing of gait. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed atherosclerosis in the proximal left anterior cerebral artery. Perfusion scans showed a delayed mean transit time in the left mesial frontal lobe. He developed two more attacks during the four months of follow up. The presented case illustrates that the mesial frontal lobe may be important in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait. We speculate that the supplementary motor area may generate a neuronal command for the initiation of locomotion that in our case may have been inhibited by a transient ischemia.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-017-0901-7,PMC5490189,Freezingof gait; Locomotor block; Mesial frontal lobe; Transient ischemic attack,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Despite having undergone rehabilitation starting at 7 weeks after onset, the patient did not show significant motor recovery of the left extremities until 6 months after onset, when the affected left leg began to show motor recovery to the point that he was able to extend his hip and knee without gravity 7 months after onset. As a result, he was able to walk independently on an even floor 9 months after onset. On 6-month diffusion tensor tractography, the right corticospinal tract showed disruption with Wallerian degeneration to the pontomedullary junction.

A 49-year-old man underwent comprehensive rehabilitation at a local rehabilitation hospital since 3 weeks after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. However, he could not walk independently because of severe motor weakness in his right leg until 19 months after the onset. At the beginning of rehabilitation at our hospital (19 months after onset), we thought that he had the neurological potential to walk independently because the unaffected (right) corticospinal tract and corticoreticulospinal tract were closely related to the gait potential, representing intact integrities. As a result, we assumed that the severe motor weakness in the right leg was mainly ascribed to LKA. At our hospital, he underwent comprehensive rehabilitation including increased doses of dopaminergic drugs (pramipexole, ropinirole, amantadine, and carbidopa/levodopa). After 10 days to our hospital, he could walk independently on an even floor with verbal supervision, concurrent with motor recovery of the right leg. After 24 days after hospital admission, he could walk independently on an even floor. We believe that the resolution of LKA in his right leg by the administration of adequate doses of dopaminergic drugs was the main reason for the delayed gait recovery in this patient. The results suggest the importance of detecting the neurological potential for gait ability of a stroke patient who cannot walk after the gait recovery phase and the causes of gait inability for individual patients.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000028711,PMC8797483,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Pathogenetically, it is considered to be a continuum of these two types of pain after becoming chronic. Repetitive peripheral painful stimulation causes a central sensitization with hypersensitivity of the corresponding spinal metamer or brain region. Therefore, signs of altered nociception, such as allodynia, may be found on the tissues of the related dermatome, myotome and sclerotome, and characterize nociplastic pain. This kind of pain was found in over 20% of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Nociplastic pain may be an amplifier of spasticity, the main pyramidal symptom that affects about 80% of pwMS.

26535475,SPECT Perfusion Imaging Demonstrates Improvement of Traumatic Brain Injury With Transcranial Near-infrared Laser Phototherapy.,"Henderson, Theodore A; Morries, Larry D",Henderson,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a growing health concern affecting civilians and military personnel. Near-infrared (NIR) light has shown benefits in animal models and human trials for stroke and in animal models for TBI. Diodes emitting low-level NIR often have lacked therapeutic efficacy, perhaps failing to deliver sufficient radiant energy to the necessary depth. In this case report, a patient with moderate TBI documented in anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) received 20 NIR treatments in the course of 2 mo using a high-power NIR laser. Symptoms were monitored by clinical examination and a novel patient diary system specifically designed for this patient population. Clinical application of these levels of infrared energy for this patient with TBI yielded highly favorable outcomes with decreased depression, anxiety, headache, and insomnia, whereas cognition and quality of life improved. Neurological function appeared to improve based on changes in the SPECT by quantitative analysis.

A desired outcome of this intervention was to realize kinematics more closely resembling those reported for normal patients. The design was a single-subject case study. Ten trials of walking gait were analysed pre-injection (PI), 1 week post-injection (1PO) and 4 weeks post-injection (4PO). The PI and 1PO sessions were found to be appreciably different from the 4PO on the joint angles of the ankle and knee at each phase of the gait cycle. These differences resulted in a reduced asymmetry of ambulation. Stride time, stance time, percentage stance time, percentage swing time and walking speed improved, showing progress towards a more efficient gait pattern. Decreased stride time and increased walking speed supported improved functional ability. The inter-trial variability of the gait parameters showed the analysis to be a consistently reproducible protocol. Conclusions based on the results included encouraging findings for the efficacy of botulinum toxin A as a therapy for the reduction of spasticity.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/026990597123610,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

The use of augmented reality or VR-based technology is being increasingly used to support physical therapy in patients with motor deficits and to improve gait, and can be used in small hospitals and outpatient departments. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with left hemiplegia due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). He received 20 minutes of VR-based real-time feedback gait training and 30 minutes of general physical therapy, 5 times a week for 8 weeks. BioRescue was used for measurement of balance, GAITRite was used for measurement of gait, and Fugl-Meyer assessment was used for lower extremity motor function measurement. These were measured before the intervention and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the intervention. After the intervention, center of pressure and limits of stability also increased. The affected step length, stride length, affected single support, and cadence were significantly increased after VR-based real-time feedback. Additionally, his lower extremity motor function score increased from 18 to 23 points. CONCLUSIONS This case report supports recent studies that have shown the value of VR-based methods as part of a physical therapy program in patients with problems with gait and motor function, including patients with stroke. VR-based real-time feedback showed favorable effects on rehabilitation following a TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.938803,PMC9986857,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

There were no signs of lesions of the pyramidal tracts or of other motor structures. The most obvious deficits were an abnormal gait with an exaggerated knee extension and a tendency to fall slowly, especially when pushed backward. In contrast, Romberg's test on an unstable platform was normal, as were long-latency leg reflexes induced by perturbations. Inadequate anticipatory and compensatory postural responses, in particular across the hip and knee joints, and slow movements seemed responsible for the falls. Muscle tone was normal but reflex studies showed signs of abnormal facilitation and inhibition at various levels of the neuraxis. We conclude that the GP and SN lesions caused defective input to premotor cortical and brain stem target zones. Dysfunctioning of these zones leads to improper control of the descending ventromedial motor system responsible for locomotion, postural control, and reflex status. The deficits in upper extremity motor performance included delayed and slow movements, inaccurate amplitudes of ballistic responses, a lack of predictive control, and deficits in bimanual coordination. Sensory feedback, proprioceptive more than visual, played a powerful compensating role in rapid aiming movements. Regional blood flow (studied using 15(O)2) was reduced in multiple frontal cortical regions, among which are the hand areas of the supplementary and premotor cortex. We hypothesize that this reflected impaired functioning of these areas, caused by defective bilateral output from GP and SN, and resulting in the motor deficits of the arm and hand.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.870100610,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Brain imaging may play a pivotal role in determining the etiology as it did for the case presented here. A new case of central nervous system (CNS) SLE is presented along with an analysis of 33 comparable cases from the scientific literature. A 70-year-old female with subacute cutaneous lupus presented to a university-based geropsychiatry program after 1 year of benign visual hallucinations and several months of shuffling gait, recurrent falls, and forgetfulness. These symptoms were highly suggestive of Lewy body dementia; however, the patient's history of basal ganglia infarct, cognitive testing demonstrating inattention and executive dysfunction, and follow-up brain imaging, which did not reveal acute findings, aligned with cerebral pathology previously attributed to vasculitis and supported the diagnosis of subcortical dementia due to SLE-CNS vasculitis. Oral prednisone 20 mg daily resolved her symptoms. Over the next 19 months, her prednisone was tapered completely and her symptoms did not return. A systematic literature search identified 33 comparable cases. An analysis of previously published cases suggests that extending the duration of the prednisone taper beyond 1 year may decrease the risk of later occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms in this patient population.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,10.1177/0891988720901788,,Lewy body dementia; case report; lymphocytic angiitis; psychosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; vasculitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

MRI showed an intramedullary cervical tumor with a solid portion extended from C1 to C3 surrounded by a cystic portion. A macroscopic complete resection was performed and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ependymoma. Postoperatively, the patient's neuropathic pain and postural dizziness worsened, with syncopal attack while upright because of severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). On physical examination, her supine systolic blood pressure was 130 mmHg and fell to 80 mmHg while sitting with no change in heart rate. We found motor palsy of the left arm, bilateral ataxia, and urinary retention. Three months later, the patient was still bedridden, notably because of the OH. After 6 months, with the association of preventative measures of OH and high doses of a direct alpha1-adrenoreceptor agonist, a vasoconstricting agent, the patient recovered an independent gait permitting her to walk unassisted. The main causes of OH include medication, nonneurogenic causes such as cardiac insufficiency, and central or peripheral neurogenic causes such as diabetic insufficiency. Brainstem tumors are known to provide severe OH but this symptom has been seldom described in a purely spinal cord lesion.

30181037,"Effects of l-Carnitine Supplementation, Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection, and Rehabilitation for a Chronic Stroke Patient.","Endo, Satoshi; Takahashi, Tadashi; Sato, Masaya; Noya, Yoshinori; Obana, Masayoshi",Endo,"Botulinum neurotoxin injection therapy and rehabilitation have been conducted for stroke patients to reduce the spasticity of their affected limbs and improve their walking ability and daily living. Furthermore, their disability was reported to be related to muscle wasting. Supplementation of l-carnitine was reported to improve physical endurance and was used to treat sarcopenia in, for example, patients with cancer. Here, we report a case of chronic stroke with muscle wasting in a patient with improved walking endurance by l-carnitine supplementation, botulinum neurotoxin injection, and rehabilitation. A 58-year-old woman had a left putamen hemorrhage 9years before, and right spastic hemiplegia and walking disability. She could walk no more than 20m. Botulinum neurotoxin injection and rehabilitation were performed 6times every 3 months. The first time, walking speed and continuous walking distance increased as her spasticity decreased. However, the improvement declined after the second and third treatments. She had right leg pain during walking, accompanied by muscle wasting. The l-carnitine prescription contributed to the attenuation of her leg pain during walking and rapid improvement of her continuous walking distance. Walking speed and endurance further improved. In addition, the withdrawal of l-carnitine did not decrease her walking ability or induce a recurrence of her leg pain. Interestingly, creatine phosphokinase increased after l-carnitine was stopped, indicating that l-carnitine had helped to reduce muscle damage during rehabilitation. This case suggests that chronic stroke patients with muscle wasting have an abnormality in the mitochondrial energy metabolism of their muscles.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.07.033,,Botulinum neurotoxin injection; continuous walking distance; l-carnitine; rehabilitation; spastic hemiplegia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It affects the individuals' participation in activities of daily living (ADLs). Dry needling treatment (DNT) uses a specialized needle to alter cortical activity. This case study aims to examine the effects of DNT on spasticity, balance, gait, and self-independence in a single patient with TBI. A twenty-six-year-old male with a history of TBI, resulting in muscle weakness on the right side of the body, spasticity, distributed balance, and difficulties with independent gait participated in this study. The Berg balance scale (BBS), 6-min walk test (6MWT), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were used to evaluate balance, gait, spasticity, and functional performance, respectively. After 36 DNT sessions extended over 12 weeks, the patient demonstrated improvements in spasticity, balance, gait, and functional capacity both immediately after the intervention and at the 4-week follow-up. This case study demonstrates that DNT is considered a novel intervention for treating spasticity and improving balance, gait, and functional capacity post-TBI. Further research is recommended to verify these findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of bodywork and movement therapies,10.1016/j.jbmt.2024.03.011,,Balance; Dry needling; Function; Rehabilitation; Spasticity; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
18033605,Serial injection of botulinum toxin for muscle imbalance due to regional spasticity in the upper limb.,"Turner-Stokes, Lynne; Ashford, Stephen",Turner-Stokes,"Three-dimensional movement in the upper limb presents a challenge for functional management of regional spasticity. Potential toxicity of botulinum toxin limits the number of muscles which may be injected in any one session. Serial injection may offer a solution, but carries theoretical risk of development of resistance due to antibody formation. This article reviews a small case series, gathered in a post-acute neuro-rehabilitation setting, to evaluate the use of serial botulinum toxin injection in terms of goal achievement and clinical evidence for toxicity or resistance. Nine patients with regional spasticity following acute stroke or brain injury had serial injection of botulinum toxin to muscle groups around the shoulder, elbow and/or wrist. Injection was followed by splinting/physiotherapy as appropriate. Goal attainment scaling was used to assess outcome. Functional goals achieved were reduction of pain (n=6/7) associated reaction (n=4/5) or care needs (n=5/6), improved gait (n=2/3) or independence in self-care (n=2/5). Two 'golden responder' cases are presented in detail to demonstrate resolution of symptoms with up to four serial injections of botulinum toxin over a period of up to 6 months. No clinical evidence of toxicity or resistance was seen in any case. These preliminary findings suggest that serial botulinum toxin injection followed by appropriate physiotherapy/splinting may provide effective treatment for regional spasticity. Resistance has not presented a problem in this post-acute situation, where treatment has not been required beyond a few months. Ongoing evaluation is underway.",{},,Disability and rehabilitation,10.1080/09638280701568205,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

This study evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of speed-dependent BWS STS training for 2 persons with chronic stroke. Two individuals 68 and 75 years old, and 2.3 and 8.7 years post-ischemic stroke, respectively, participated. Both exhibited right hemiparesis, required moderate (25%-50%) assistance for STS, and ambulated household distances with assistive devices. Participants performed speed-dependent BWS STS training 3 days/week for 45 to 60 minutes until able to perform STS independently. Gait parameters, the Stroke Impact Scale Mobility Domain (SIS-mobility), and the 3-Repetition STS test (3RSTS) were assessed before and after intervention. Each participant completed more than 750 STS repetitions over the course of the intervention, achieving independence in 8 to 11 sessions. Aside from muscle soreness, no adverse effects occurred. Participants also exhibited increased gait velocity (0.17-0.24 m/s and 0.25-0.42 m/s), SIS-mobility score (78-88 and 63-66), and decreased 3RSTS time (18-8 seconds and 40-21 seconds). Speed-dependent BWS STS training appears to be a feasible and promising method to increase STS independence and speed for persons with chronic stroke.

The intent of this case study is to describe outcomes associated with a therapy program that combines task-specific and strength training in an individual post-stroke and to discuss some possible mechanisms and modulating factors that may affect post-stroke neurologic recovery and responsiveness to intervention. The participant was a 38-year-old female with right middle cerebral artery stroke, evaluated 15 months postonset. She ambulated independently with an ankle-foot orthosis and straight cane. Her free and fast overground velocity was 0.50 m/s and 0.62 m/s, respectively. Body-weight supported treadmill training and a limb-loaded cycling exercise were alternated over 24 treatments sessions (4 times/wk for 6 wks). Measurements were taken pre-, post-treatment, and at a 6-mo follow-up. Instrumented gait and motion analysis with fine-wire EMG recording of LE muscle activity occurred pre- and post-treatment. Post-treatment, walking speed increased 18% for free--(0.59 m/ s) and 14.4% for fast-velocity (0.71 m/s); 6-min walking distance increased 4% (184.4 m). At 6-mos, continued improvements in all walking outcomes were evident. Gait and motion analysis revealed that functional locomotor recovery was associated with increases in magnitude of paretic leg gluteus maximus and gluteus medius activation during gait. Motion analysis confirmed an increase of hip and knee extension motions throughout stance and swing. For the person in this case clinically meaningful changes in walking function were associated with a combined therapeutic program that included both task-specific and LE strength training. Possible mechanisms associated with response to therapy were related to improved motor unit activation associated with increased strength in key muscles used in gait.",{},,Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT,10.1097/01.npt.0000281950.86311.82,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment with Body Weight Support Treadmill Training (BWSTT) has been demonstrated in patients with stroke and spinal cord injuries, but limited data is available in PD. <b>Aims:</b> The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of BWSTT in the rehabilitation of gait in PD patients. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-six PD inpatients were enrolled and performed rehabilitation treatment for 4-weeks, with daily sessions. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: both groups underwent daily 40-min sessions of traditional physiokinesitherapy followed by 20-min sessions of overground gait training (Control group) or BWSTT (BWSTT group). The efficacy of BWSTT was evaluated with clinical scales and Computerized Gait Analysis (CGA). Patients were tested at baseline (T0) and at the end of the 4-weeks rehabilitation period (T1). <b>Results:</b> Both BWSTT and Control groups experienced a significant improvement in clinical scales as FIM and UPDRS and in gait parameters for both interventions. Even if we failed to detect any statistically significant differences between groups in the different clinical and gait parameters, the intragroup analysis captured a specific pattern of qualitative improvement associated to cadence and stride duration for the BWSTT group and to the swing/stance ratio for the Control group. Four patients with chronic pain or anxious symptoms did not tolerate BWSTT. <b>Conclusions:</b> BWSTT and traditional rehabilitation treatment are both effective in improving clinical motor functions and kinematic gait parameters. BWSTT may represent an option in PD patients with specific symptoms that limit traditional overground gait training, e.g., severe postural instability, balance disorder, orthostatic hypotension. BWSTT is generally well-tolerated, though caution is needed in subjects with chronic pain or with anxious symptoms. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03815409.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2018.01066,PMC6375880,Parkinson's disease; body weight support treadmill training; computerized gait analysis; gait rehabilitation; neurorehabilitation,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This study tested the feasibility of wearing the NewGait rehabilitative device in individuals with gait impairments due to the most common neurological disorders. Seven participants with gait impairments due to strokes, Multiple Sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) were included in the study. Their walking with and without wearing the NewGait was analyzed and compared using the Vicon T160 system for motion analysis. Gait velocity, step length, foot clearance, lateral displacement of the Center of Mass, gait deviation and symmetry indexes were compared using two standard deviation band method for each participant. Participants subjectively assessed the NewGait as a comfortable device to wear and showed immediate gait improvements to varying degrees. Most improvements were observed in participants with muscle weakness due to peripheral neuropathies, stroke, MS, and CP. These participants improved their foot clearance, gait velocity, and step length. Participants with cerebellar stroke and PD increased their gait stability. All participants demonstrated a reduction in composite gait deviation indexes. Not all gait parameters, though, showed immediate changes. The results suggest that the NewGait rehabilitative device is feasible and useful for correcting gait impairments caused by neurological deficits. Participants may need to wear this device for longer periods of time in order to achieve long lasting changes in the gait pattern, rather than an immediate correction.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Physiotherapy research international : the journal for researchers and clinicians in physical therapy,10.1002/pri.2055,,Parkinson's disease; assistive technology; cerebral palsy; multiple sclerosis; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

The trajectories of the foot plates are freely programmable enabling not only the practice of simulated floor walking but also stair climbing up and down. The article intended to compare lower limb muscle activation patterns of hemiparetic subjects during real floor walking and stairs climbing up, and during the corresponding simulated conditions on the machine, and secondly to demonstrate gait improvement on single case after training on the machine. The muscle activation pattern of seven lower limb muscles of six hemiparetic patients during free and simulated walking on the floor and stair climbing was measured via dynamic electromyography. A non-ambulatory, sub-acute stroke patient additionally trained on the G-EO-Systems every workday for five weeks. The muscle activation patterns were comparable during the real and simulated conditions, both on the floor and during stair climbing up. Minor differences, concerning the real and simulated floor walking conditions, were a delayed (prolonged) onset (duration) of the thigh muscle activation on the machine across all subjects. Concerning stair climbing conditions, the shank muscle activation was more phasic and timely correct in selected patients on the device. The severely affected subject regained walking and stair climbing ability. The G-EO-Systems is an interesting new option in gait rehabilitation after stroke.

8828062,Effect of weak electromagnetic fields on body image perception in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Cerebellar ataxia is one of the most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and also one of the least responsive to pharmacotherapy. However, cerebellar symptoms often improve dramatically in MS patients by brief, extracerebral applications of picotesla flux electromagnetic fields (EMFs). This report concerns two MS patients with chronic disabling ataxia who experienced rapid improvement in gait and balance after receiving a series of treatments with EMFs. To assess whether improvement in cerebellar gait is accompanied by changes in body image perception, a parietal lobe function, both patients were administered the Human Figure Drawing Test before and after a series of brief treatments with EMFs. Prior to application of EMFs these patients' free drawings of a person showed a figure with a wide-based stance characteristic of cerebellar ataxia. After receiving a series of EMFs treatments both patients demonstrated a change in body image perception with the drawings of the human figure showing a normal stance. These findings demonstrate that in MS improvement in cerebellar symptoms by pulsed applications of picotesla EMFs is associated with changes in the body image.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459608986700,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The purpose of this case series was to examine the feasibility and benefits of the IMT protocol across a sample of 4 individuals with diverse chronic neurological diagnoses, including incomplete spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and cerebral hemispherectomy. The 4 participants enrolled in the IMT protocol and followed an intensive treatment schedule of 3 h/d sessions for 10 consecutive weekdays totaling 30 hours. Each session allocated 1 hour each to (1) body weight-supported treadmill-based locomotor training, (2) balance interventions, and (3) activities to improve coordination, strength, and range of motion. Interventions emphasized repetitive, task-specific training of lower-extremity movements in a massed practice schedule. Pain, fatigue, and time in activity were used to assess feasibility of the treatment. Temporal-spatial gait parameters, Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go test, and 6-Minute Walk test were used to assess changes in performance. Participants were able to complete an average of 144 of 180 minutes of activity per day for 10 days. Participants demonstrated modest improvements after the intervention on at least one outcome measure for each target area of gait, mobility, and balance. Some improvements were maintained for 1 to 6 months after participation. Despite differences in diagnosis among these participants with chronic neurological disorders, on average they were able to complete 80% of an intensive treatment schedule of 3 hours/day for 10 days with no adverse effects.

27049732,Robotic gait assistive technology as means to aggressive mobilization strategy in acute rehabilitation following severe diffuse axonal injury: a case study.,"Stam, Daniel; Fernandez, Jennifer",Stam,"Diffuse axonal injury is a prominent cause of disablement post-traumatic brain injury. Utilization of the rapid expansion of our current scientific knowledge base combined with greater access to neurological and assistive technology as adjuncts to providing sensorimotor experience may yield innovative new approaches to rehabilitation based upon a dynamic model of brain response following injury. A 24-year-old female who sustained a traumatic brain injury, bilateral subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe diffuse axonal injury secondary to a motor vehicle collision. Evidence-based appraisal of present literature suggests a link between graded intensity of aerobic activity to facilitation of neuro-plastic change and up-regulation of neurotrophins essential to functional recovery post-diffuse axonal injury. Following resolution of paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia, aggressive early mobilization techniques were progressed utilizing robotic assistive gait technology in combination with conventional therapy. This approach allowed for arguably greater repetition and cardiovascular demands across a six-month inpatient rehabilitation stay. Outcomes in this case suggest that the use of assistive technology to adjunct higher level and intensity rehabilitation strategies may be a safe and effective means towards reduction of disablement following severe traumatic brain and neurological injury. Implications for Rehabilitation Functional recovery and neuroplasticity following diffuse neurological injury involves a complex process determined by the sensorimotor experience provided by rehabilitation clinicians. This process is in part modulated by intrinsic brain biochemical processes correlated to cardiovascular intensity of the activity provided. It is important that rehabilitation professionals monitor physiological response to higher intensity activities to provide an adaptive versus maladaptive response of central nervous system plasticity with activity. Identification of early mobilization parameters and skill acquisition may assist selection of gait assistive technology adjunct in progressing early optimal physical rehabilitation outcomes in the acute inpatient setting.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Disability and rehabilitation.

FES-cycling, providing a repetitive goal-oriented task, could facilitate cortical reorganization and utilization of residual cortico-spinal pathways. These benefits could be more enhanced in children because of the greater plasticity and flexibility of their central nervous system. The aim of the present case report study was to explore the feasibility of FES-cycling in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to provide a set of instrumental measures able to evaluate the effects of this novel treatment on cycling and walking ability. Interventional study. Two ambulant outpatient children with diplegic CP were recruited by the ""E. Medea"" Scientific Institute. Patients followed a FES-cycling treatment for 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week for 7 weeks. Pre and post treatment tests were performed, namely clinical measures and electromyographic, kinematic and oxygen expenditure analysis during gait and cycling. The treatment was safe, feasible and well accepted by the 2 children. After treatment both patients achieved a more symmetrical muscular strategy during voluntary cycling and gait and a significant reduction of muscle co-contractions during cycling. These improvements were corroborated by a decrease in oxygen expenditure during the post test for one of the two children, the less impaired, implying a better exploiting of bi-articular muscles. FES-cycling is feasible and safe and it may be an alternative rehabilitation method for diplegic CP patients.

Over the next year, she gradually began to talk less, but her speech itself became more rapid than before. He speech was frequently too fast even for family members to understand. In 1997, she was admitted to our hospital. On admission, the patient was disoriented but able to follow simple verbal commands, to name things, and to write simple words. Neither apraxia, aphasia, hemispatial neglect, nor a corpus callosum disconnection syndrome was observed. There was no muscle weakness or atrophy. She showed a positive Babinski sign with mild spasticity in the legs and Gegenhalten, but no rigidity. Her speech was monotonous and abnormally fast (cluttering-like speech). Her speech became faster and faster toward the end of sentences, skipping several syllables or even words. She was unable to speak slowly and clearly, even when efforts were made to pace her speech to the speed set by the examiner. She was able to stand only with a wide base of support and body flexion. When standing, she was unable to place one foot directly beside the other; as she tried to have one foot near the other, the former repelled the latter. She had great difficulties in taking her first step forward, and showed rapid freezing of gait even when she managed to succeed in starting. She was able to imitate walking or bicycling with her legs unloaded, indicating that her gait disturbance was a kind of apraxia of gait. Her intelligence was somehow difficult to assess because of her peculiar speech disturbance. However, her family members had noticed her memory disturbance and personality change (offensiveness) since 3 to 4 years before the admission. Moreover, she was defective not only on Hasegawa Damentia Scale-Revised but also on Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices which estimates non-verbal intelligence. It was also noted that she was inattentive and lazy in thinking on questionnaires. Thus we considered that she was at least mildly demented and the type of dementia was of frontal pathology.

21254790,Rapid improvement of chronic stroke deficits after perispinal etanercept: three consecutive cases.,"Tobinick, Edward",Tobinick,"Thrombolytic therapy reduces stroke size and disability by reperfusion and salvage of ischaemic penumbra. Emerging evidence suggests that retrieved penumbra may be the site of ongoing inflammatory pathology that includes extensive microglial activation. Microglial activation may be associated with excessive levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and resultant neurotoxicity. Etanercept, a potent biologic TNF antagonist, reduces microglial activation in experimental models and has been therapeutically effective in models of brain and neuronal injury. Perispinal administration of etanercept, previously reported to be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, may facilitate delivery of etanercept into the brain. The objective of this report is to document the initial clinical response to perispinal etanercept in the first chronic stroke cohort so treated. Three consecutive patients with stable and persistent chronic neurological deficits due to strokes that had failed to resolve despite previous treatment and rehabilitation were evaluated at an outpatient clinic. They were treated off-label with perispinal etanercept as part of the clinic's practice of medicine. All three patients had chronic hemiparesis, in addition to other stroke deficits. Their stroke distributions were right middle cerebral artery (MCA), brainstem (medulla) and left MCA. The two patients with MCA strokes had both received acute thrombolytic therapy. Each of the three patients was treated with an initial dose of perispinal etanercept 13, 35 and 36 months following their acute stroke, respectively. Significant clinical improvement following perispinal etanercept administration was observed in all patients. Onset of clinical response was evident within 10 minutes of perispinal injection in all patients. Improvements in hemiparesis, gait, hand function, hemi-sensory deficits, spatial perception, speech, cognition and behaviour were noted among the patients treated. Each patient received a second perispinal etanercept dose at 22-26 days after the first dose that was followed by additional clinical improvement. Open-label administration of perispinal etanercept resulted in rapid neurological improvement in three consecutive patients with chronic neurological dysfunction due to strokes occurring 13-36 months earlier. These results suggest that stroke may result in chronic TNF-mediated pathophysiology that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention long after the acute event.

It is considered as ""apraxia of gait"" in a classical sense, which differs from frozen gait. Observation of this patient suggests that the infero-medical part of the frontal lobe plays an important role in the initiation of gait. Furthermore, common features of frozen gait in patients with Parkinson's disease and in patients with multiple cerebral infarction involving the frontal lobe suggest that the nigrostriatal structures and the frontal lobe are important in CNS mechanisms subserving smooth locomotion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

The subject was a 57-year old female who was 3.5 years post-brain tumor surgery. She was presented with impaired right lower extremity muscle performance, increased lower extremity muscle tension, and right knee hyperextension. She reported pain at the right knee joint and tibialis anterior after 10 minutes of over-ground walk. Fifteen one-hour sessions of gait training with robotic knee orthosis (RKO) were provided an over 3 weeks period. The subject demonstrated improvement with right lower limb kinematic and kinetic measures of gait. Peak flexion degree and moment increased (from -4.99° to 13.47°, and from 0.18 Nm/kg to 0.20 Nm/kg respectively).Extension peak moment decreased from 1.03 Nm/kg to 0.53 Nm/kg. Knee joint force decreased from 0.68 N to 0.45 N. Ground reaction force (GRF) reduced from 11.06N to 10.11N. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) improved from 45/56 to 51/56.

The first case was associated with multiple sclerosis and demonstrated a severe postural cerebellar tremor and an alternate activation of antagonist muscles in the right arm. The second case, with hemorrhage in the brainstem, demonstrated a severe tremor at rest and mixed synchronous and alternating activation of antagonist muscles in the left forearm. MR imaging studies localized lesions possibly responsible for these tremors. In the first case a lesion was located in the superior cerebellar peduncle just under the decussation, and in the second case a lesion was found between the red nucleus and the thalamus, with possible involvement of both the cerebellothalamic and nigrostriatal pathways. The first case accords with the theory that a lesion located in the dentate nucleus and its projection can cause severe postural cerebellar tremor. The lesion demonstrated in the second case may be responsible for ""cerebellar tremor at rest"" or ""static (resting) cerebellar tremor.""",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.870080218,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

6983299,Development of a universal control unit for functional electrical stimulation (FES).,"Brandell, B R",Brandell,"In collaboration with the College of Engineering the author has developed a laboratory, or clinic, based, battery operated ""universal"" control system, designed to improve disabled gait in upper motor neuron disabilities, especially stroke, hemiplegia, and cerebral palsy, by applying several channels of FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) to the lower limb muscles while the patient is walking. The timing of the FES pulses, which can be applied to as many as six of the patient's muscles, is determined by potentiometer controlled one-shot timers, which are triggered by any of three switches in the sole of either shoe. Combinations of inverters, flip flops, AND gates and OR gates in the externally connected logic circuits determine the sequence of delays and pulses applied to the patient's muscles. This paper describes and diagrams some of the logic circuits and as an example of the possible application of the concept of a ""universal"" control unit reports the modifications of gait induced in a hemiplegic, four year post-stroke, patient. The characteristics of this patient's gait with FES in comparison to its characteristics without FES are demonstrated with motion picture frames, EMG recordings and graphic tracings of her right knee and ankle joint positions. They include more symmetrical timing of her right and left stance and swing phases, increased dorsiflexion of her right ankle in the swing phase, followed by a more distinct heel strike, and improved flexion--extension sequences of the knee and ankle joints and an increased heel rise in the stance phase. The author concludes that the gait characteristics of some hemiplegic patients will improve as they become adapted over a period of weeks or months to a control logic, which lessens their functional limitations by the use of a properly timed and amplified sequence of FES pulses. He suggests that the FES control requirements for individual patients should be determined experimentally with a control system ""universally"" adaptable to a wide range of disabilities, and that these control parameters could then determine the design of portable units, which may be used on a long term basis. These units would include only the operational options needed to duplicate the gait corrections found to be practicable for each individual patient, by the testing procedure, through a universal logic unit as described in this paper.",{},,American journal of physical medicine,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

She had difficulty in writing because of action myoclonus in her arms. She also exhibited freezing gait and was unable to walk without cane. Although her gait disturbance resembled those seen in patients with parkinsonism secondary to anoxic encephalopathy, surface electromyography revealed that it was caused by action myoclonus in her legs. The presence of giant somatosensory evoked potentials and enhanced cortical reflexes in response to the electrical stimulation to her posterior tibial nerves supported our diagnosis. A combined therapy with valproate sodium, clonazepam and piracetam (15 g/day) was not effective. However, her freezing gait remarkably improved and she was able to walk without help, after the treatment with sufficient dose of piracetam (21 g/day). Cortical hyperexcitability as revealed by electrophysiological examination also improved.

9522259,Treatment with electromagnetic fields improves dual-task performance (talking while walking) in multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with an increased risk of falling resulting from visual disturbances, difficulties with gait and balance, apraxia of gait and peripheral neuropathy. These factors often interact synergistically to compromise the patient's gait stability. It has long been recognized that walking involves a cognitive component and that simultaneous cognitive and motor operations (dual-task) such as talking while walking may interfere with normal ambulation. Talking while walking reflects an example of a dual-task which is frequently impaired in MS patients. Impaired dual-task performance during walking may compromise the patient's gait and explain why in some circumstances, MS patients unexpectedly lose their balance and fall. Frontal lobe dysfunction, which commonly occurs in MS patients, may disrupt dual-task performance and increase the risk of falling in these patients. This report concerns a 36 old man with remitting-progressive MS with an EDSS score of 5.5 who experienced marked increase in spasticity in the legs and trunk and worsening of his gait and balance, occasionally resulting in falling, when talking while walking. His gait and balance improved dramatically after he received two successive transcranial treatments, each of 45 minutes, with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7.5 picotesla flux density. Simultaneously, there was improvement in dual-task performance to the extent that talking while walking did not adversely affect his ambulation. In addition, neuropsychological testing revealed an almost 5-fold increase in word output on the Thurstone's Word-Fluency Test, which is sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction. It is suggested that facilitation of dual-task performance during ambulation contributes to the overall improvement of gait and balance observed in MS patients receiving transcranial treatment with AC pulsed EMFs.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459708986393,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There remains a lack of information regarding the effectiveness of exercise training on individuals with DS post-stroke. This case report describes the effects of a comprehensive exercise program on an individual with DS who had sustained a stroke. A 20-year-old male with DS recovering from a left hemorrhagic stroke 18 months previous underwent a 12-week land and water-based program 60 minutes/session, 5 sessions/week. Exercise sessions addressed specific limitations, including cardiorespiratory fitness, generalized muscle weakness, balance deficits, and reduced ambulatory ability in terms of speed, gait pattern and walking tolerance. Between the baseline and 6-month follow-up assessments improvements were noted in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak, 8% increase), one-repetition maximum (51%), community balance and mobility scale (54%), comfortable walking speed (42%), six-minute walk test (28%) and daily step count (21%). Improved cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, balance and mobility provide preliminary evidence of the trainability of individuals with both DS and stroke. Future studies are warranted to investigate the role of exercise in risk factor reduction for primary and secondary prevention of stroke in people with DS. Implications for Rehabilitation Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) may be at heightened risk of stroke due to a combination of physiological conditions and lifestyle choices which contribute to reduced exercise capacity, accelerated aging patterns, moyamoya syndrome and physical inactivity as well as high rates of obesity and related conditions. More intensive fitness programs may be particularly important for people with both DS and stroke. Participation in a comprehensive exercise program can be safe and effective in regaining pre-stroke levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, functional mobility and goal attainment. RESULTS suggest that a more intensive physical therapy regimen may be recommendable during out-patient rehabilitation for individuals with DS post-stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Disability and rehabilitation,10.3109/09638288.2013.833304,,Down syndrome; exercise training; single subject design; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Histopathological findings showed a reticulum cell sarcoma. There were no findings of systemic malignant lymphoma. Such intracranial malignant lymphomas showing repeated regression including spontaneous one are very rare in the literature. The freezing phenomenon in this case started with festinating speech and spread to writing and gait.

Four years later, the measurement of visual field defects (Goldmann perimeter) showed persistence of bilateral blindness with a 2-degree preservation of macular vision and a perifoveal sparing between 10 to 30 degrees of eccentricity in the left inferior quadrant. Despite this visual impairment, the subject was able to perform visually-guided locomotion. Moreover he consciously perceived visual motion in the blind parts of his visual field. CT and MRI showed a lesion involving most of the striated cortex. The visual cortex located in the internal occipito-parital regions was relatively spared. The contribution of this structure to extra-striated vision of motion is discussed.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

He was well until June of 1991 when he had an onset of backache and right chest pain. On August 25, he lost sensation to void and he became unable to urinate. On the same day, he noted weakness in his legs which became progressively worse, and he was admitted to our hospital. Past medical history included diabetes mellitus which was found 3 years previously. He had upper gastrointestinal series 2 months before, which revealed a normal study. On admission, he was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a mentally sound man with normal higher cerebral functions. Cranial nerves were also intact. He was unable to walk. No muscle atrophy was noted, but he had moderate to marked (2/5) weakness in both legs. No ataxia was noted in the upper extremities. Jaw jerk was normal, however, deep reflexes in the upper extremities were decreased, and absent in the lower extremities Babinski sign was present bilaterally. All sensory modalities were diminished below the Th 6 dermatome. No meningeal sign was present. Emergency myelography was performed on the day of admission, which revealed complete block from the Th4 to Th8 segments. CSF taken at that time was xanthochromic, positive Queckenstedt test containing 1,133 mg/dl of protein, 54 mg/dl of sugar and 1/3 microliters of lymphocyte. On August 31, laminectomy was performed from Th5 to Th7. The spinal bones in this area was very fragile and hemorrhagic. A soft yellowish vascular-rich tissue was surrounding the spinal cord in the epidural space. Despite surgery his weakness in legs worsened, and he became paraplegic by September 10th. He became somnolent with disorientation to time. In the subsequent course, he developed metabolic acidosis on September 26. On September 28, he became anuric and hypotensive.

9125748,[A 85-year-old woman with the onset of progressive gait disturbance at 80 years of the age].,"Yoritaka, A; Hattori, T; Hattori, Y; Mori, H; Matsuoka, S; Shirai, T; Kondo, T; Mizuno, Y",Yoritaka,"We report a 85-year-old woman who had an onset of gait disturbance at 80 years of the age. She had a dizzy spell when she was 80-year-old. She was evaluated at another hospital where paroxysmal tachycardia and sinus arrest lasting as long as 5.8 seconds were found. She was diagnosed as having sick sinus syndrome and a pace maker was inserted. She had a gradual onset of disturbance of gait shortly after the above dizzy spell. She became unable to walk fast and her steps became small. Neurologic examination at age 83 revealed small step gait with freezing episodes. Retropulsion was present. No motor weakness or origidity was noted. She had no tremor. Mentally she was alert and sound. Cranial nerves were essentially normal. Cranial CT scan revealed slight diffuse low density change in the bilateral cerebral white matter. She was treated with amantadine HCI and levodopa with carbidopa. Her gait and balance showed some improvement. She developed pneumonia and worsening of her gait when she was 85 years of the age, and she was admitted again to our hospital. She was mentally alert and sound but she showed marked freezing of gait with loss of postural reflex; she would have fallen down unless supported upon standing. Cranial nerves were again essentially normal. Her hospital course was complicated by pneumonia, DIC, and renal failure. She expired suddenly on the 10th day of her last admission. She was discussed in a neurological CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had vascular parkinsonism due to lacunar state. However, paucity of vascular changes in her CT scan remained as a question. Other participants thought that she had nigral cell loss secondary to her aging and circulatory disturbance which would have been caused by her sick sinus syndrome. Post-mortem examination revealed marked loss of nigral pigmented cells; the cell loss was diffusely seen in the substantia nigra. Neurofibrillary tangles were seen in the remaining neurons. In addition, gliosis was noted in the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, however, neuronal loss was very mild in those nuclei. In the superior colliculus, neuronal loss was mild, however, gliosis was seen. No clear neuronal loss was observed in the locus coeruleus, however, Lewy bodies were seen in the remaining neurons. Furthermore, Lewy bodies were also found in the substantia sigra. It was thought that she had progressive supranuclear play (PSP). Question was whether or not she was complicated by Parkinson's disease. Clinically, she had no rigidity or tremor. Pathologically, locus coeruleus did not show neuronal loss. Therefore, incidental Lewy body disease was raised as a possibility. Finally, it should be pointed out that she had no oculomotor disturbance or dementia, yet she had PSP. Her clinical features were those of pure akinesia. Pathologic changes were also relatively mild except for those in the substantia nigra. Possibility of post-encephalitic parkinsonism without encephalitis was also discussed, however, over all distribution of her pathologic changes was more consistent with PSP.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Clinical Conference; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
2382145,[Treatment of intra-articular calcaneus fracture in the standard care hospital].,"Dresing, K; Eyssel, M",Dresing,"A total of 49 intra-articular fractures of the calcaneum were treated from January 1985 to December 1988. In 27 cases the fracture was treated with functional therapy, while in 21 cases management was surgical. The diagnostic procedure was the following: conventional radiography was lateral, axial and dorsoplantar exposures after Böhler. These radiographs allow adequate classification and selection for surgery for the treatment of intra-articular fractures. CT examination is often not available in a general or county hospital, and is not essential for the decision as to whether a conservative or a surgical procedure is more appropriate. Intra-articular fracture of the calcaneum is an indication for surgery except when the bones are totally fractured. We excluded from surgery: 6 patients older than 65 years, 3 with multiple trauma, 2 patients who were receiving coumarin treatment, 3 patients with occlusive arterial disease, and 1 patient who had suffered a cerebral stroke. In 4 cases the patients declined the proposed surgical treatment. Surgery was performed 8 days after trauma. Only lateral incisions were used. We used the Bézes technique, in which bone plate and screw fixation is combined with spongiosa grafting. We observed no necrosis of skin or soft tissue and no infection. Follow-up examination was possible in 33 patients (59% after conservative and 81% after surgical treatment).

It had a tilted head to the left and an atactic gait especially in the hind limbs. When it was forced to stop or to change direction it fell down. General condition and sensorium were apart from a reduced bathyaesthesia normal. By clinical and laboratory examination some possible causes of locomotion disturbances in lambs like copper deficiency, nutritive muscle dystrophy and meningitis could be ruled out. By X-ray examination an asymmetry of the os occipitale and atlas was diagnosed. They were not well distinguishable from each other. The second vertebra showed a rotation with angulation of its longitudinal axis to the left and a dorso-lateral subluxation. By myelography a narrowing of the vertebral canal between first and second vertebra could be shown. Because of the poor prognosis the animal was euthanised.

It has been proved that surgical removal of intracerebral hematomas improves the survival rate. Yet, the results of recovery primarily depend on the type of surgery. A new method of stereotaxic removal of intracerebral hematomas has a number of advantages over the open method, primarily low traumatism. The prognosis of the recovery of motor ability is determined by not only the type of surgery but by a number of other factors as well, namely, the volume and localization of the hematoma, the degree of deformation of the brain stem and the timing of surgical intervention. The results of clinical employment of the new method in 51 patients should be considered encouraging while the operation of stereotaxic removal of intracerebral hematomas appears rather promising.",{},,"Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

This 36-year-old male had suffered suprasellar germinoma with hydrocephalus and had had a V-P shunt following radiotherapy. Sixteen years later he developed gait disturbance and somnolence and MRI demonstrated a small lateral ventricle as well as a diffuse dural enhancement. A lumbar tap revealed a low ICP of 12 mmH2O. Because of this, an ASD was placed in the patient. Postoperatively, his symptoms of gait and consciousness disturbance improved. Typical clinical findings of low ICP syndrome such as headache were not observed in this case. To our knowledge, no symptom of gait disturbance with low ICP has been reported previously. We present an interesting case of low ICP syndrome with gait disturbance and discuss the mechanism of the symptoms. Symptoms of this patient were due at first to brain ischemia. After convulsion and consciousness disturbance due to low intracranial pressure, the symptoms increased in strength until gait disturbance occurred. The possibility is suggested that gait disturbance in this patient was due both to brain ischemia and low intracranial pressure.",{},,No shinkei geka.

Muscle force and foot contact evaluations were done using the Cybex and the Cleveland Veterans Administration Gait Laboratory. After implantation of intramuscular electrodes, all three patients had improved function but still desired some supervision in walking. A ten-fold increase in knee torque was noted in one patient, thereby providing him with nearly normal strength. No implant complications were noted.

She was apparently well until December of 1993 when she was 81-year-old. At that time, she was operated or her cataract. Her post operative course was uneventful, however, shortly after her operation, she had an onset of memory loss and abnormal behavior. She showed a fluctuating course in her mental disturbance. In 1995, her dementia worsened with nocturnal agitation. She was admitted to our service on June 12, 1995. She was alert and her blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg. She showed recent memory loss and disorientation to time. Motor wise, she was unable to stand unsupported. Her gait with support showed small steps and a wide base. She was bradykinetic and ataxic in her finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee test, however, no rigidity or tremor was noted. Her MRI showed T2-high signal lesions in both medial thalamic areas, in the right occipital lobe, and in the bilateral cerebral white matters as well as in the basal ganglia. She was discharged for out-patient follow up on July 3, 1995. Four days after the discharge, she showed declining responses to stimuli and she developed dyspnea on July 14, 1995. She was admitted again on the same day. Her body temperature was 38.5 degrees C and moist rales were heard in the left lung field. She appeared drowsy and no verbal response was obtained; no apparent motor palsy was noted. Blood count showed leukocytosis (14,300/ml). Blood gas analysis under 61 of oxygen inhalation through a mask was as follows: pH 7.460, PCO2 39.6 mmHg, PO2 67 mmHg, and HCO3-28.5 mEq/l. Two days after admission, she developed a convulsion in her left arm and she became unconscious. Her EEG showed periodically recurring lateralized epileptic discharges on the right fronto-central areas. Her subsequent course was complicated by status epilepticus and respiratory distress. She died on July 26, 1995. She was discussed in a neurological CPC. The chief discussant arrived at a conclusion that she suffered from multi-infarct dementia. Bilateral thalamic infarctions were considered to have played a significant role in her dementia. Post-mortem examination revealed subcortical leukoencephalopathy of Binswanger's type and cerebral infarctions in the thalamic and basal ganglia regions and in the right occipital lobe. In addition, she showed isolated angitis of the central nervous system involving mainly in the small arteries located in the superficial areas of the brain and the spinal cord.

The clinical course of multiple lacunar state is usually progressive in nature, simulating degenerative diseases, in contrast with the mode of acute onset seen in the other vascular diseases. Average age at the initial visit was 63.8 year-old, and sex ratio showed marked male preponderance, being 12 for males and 1 for females. Gait disturbance and speech disturbance are the most frequent initial symptoms, followed by slow motion, emotional lability and swallowing difficulty. Neurological manifestations are dysarthria, short-stepped and apraxic gait, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski and Chaddock reflexes, minimal spasticity, dementia, positive palmo-mental reflex, emotional lability, fixed face, rigidity, bradykinesia, foot grasping, dysphagia, positive Myerson's sign and tremor, in the order described. The important point is that the rigidity is paratonic and the tremor is action or postural, not the cogwheel rigidity or resting tremor like Parkinson's disease. The appearance of pathological reflexes (Babinski and Chaddock reflexes) are quite important, especially Chaddock reflex, which can frequently become positive despite negative or equivocal Babinski reflex. Hypertension, especially longstanding in nature, is the major contributing factor in this disorder. CT scan showed the presence of one or more lacunes in 52 out of 65 cases (80.0%). The detection of lacune can be influenced by the quality of CT scan, and the high resolution CT scanner is greatly useful for that purpose.
