33647851,Auditory agnosia with anosognosia.,"Klarendić, Maja; Gorišek, Veronika R; Granda, Gal; Avsenik, Jernej; Zgonc, Vid; Kojović, Maja",Klarendić,"A 66-year-old right-handed female medical doctor suffered two consecutive cardioembolic strokes, initially affecting the right frontal lobe and the right insula, followed by a lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient presented with distinctive phenomenology of general auditory agnosia with anosognosia for the deficit. She did not understand verbal requests and her answers to oral questions were fluent but unrelated to the topic. However, she was able to correctly answer written questions, name objects, and fluently describe their purpose, which is characteristic for verbal auditory agnosia. She was also unable to recognise environmental sounds or to recognise and repeat any melody. These inabilities represent environmental sound agnosia and amusia, respectively. Surprisingly, she was not aware of the problem, not asking any questions regarding her symptoms, and avoiding discussing her inability to understand spoken language, which is indicative of anosognosia. The deficits in our patient followed a distinct pattern of recovery. The verbal auditory agnosia was the first to resolve, followed by environmental sound agnosia. Amusia persisted the longest. The patient was clinically assessed from the first day of symptom onset and the evolution of symptoms was video documented. We give a detailed account of the patient's behaviour and provide results of audiological and neuropsychological evaluations. We discuss the anatomy of auditory agnosia and anosognosia relevant to the case. This case study may serve to better understand auditory agnosia in clinical settings. It is important to distinguish auditory agnosia from Wernicke's aphasia, because use of written language may enable normal communication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.12.025,,Amusia; Anosognosia; Auditory agnosia; Environmental sound agnosia; Verbal auditory agnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

32386850,Cortical deafness of following bilateral temporal lobe stroke.,"Silva, Júlia; Sousa, Marisa; Mestre, Susana; Nzwalo, Isa; Nzwalo, Hipólito",Silva,"Cortical deafness is an extremely rare clinical manifestation that originates mainly from bilateral cortical lesions in the primary auditory cortex. Its main clinical manifestation is the bilateral sudden loss of hearing. Diagnosis is difficulty due to its rarity and similarity with other language and communication disorders, such as Wernicke's aphasia, auditory agnosia or verbal deafness. Herein, we present a case report of a young woman with a sudden bilateral loss of auditory comprehension. Initially, a psychiatric nature of the disorder was considered, but the persistence of the symptoms, lead to the diagnosis of cortical deafness secondary to bilateral ischemic lesions in both temporal lobes. Progressive improvement occurred and three months after the initial manifestations she manifested pure verbal deafness. Cortical deafness usually has a poor functional prognosis, with limited therapeutic options. Rehabilitation and speech therapy is recommended to improve the chance of patients achieving communication skills.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104827,,Auditory agnosia; Auditory cortex; Cortical deafness; Stroke; Verbal deafness,Case Reports,United States,eng

Herein, we present a patient with semantic variant PPA (svPPA) who demonstrated impaired verbal word discrimination. Audiological examinations revealed normal auditory brainstem responses and slightly impaired pure-tone perception. By contrast, verbal word discrimination and monosyllable identification were impaired, and temporal auditory acuity deteriorated. Analyses of brain magnetic resonance images revealed a significant decrease in the gray matter volume in bilateral superior temporal areas, predominantly on the left, compared with those of patients with typical svPPA, which appeared to be associated with impaired word recognition in our patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2022.873735,PMC9243420,auditory agnosia; nonverbal sound discrimination; primary progressive aphasia; semantic variant; verbal word discrimination; verbal word recognition; word discrimination,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
14681117,Music agnosia and auditory agnosia. Dissociations in stroke patients.,"Vignolo, Luigi A",Vignolo,"A review and an experimental study were carried out in search of dissociations between the recognition of music (music agnosia) and that of environmental sounds (auditory agnosia) in stroke patients. The review focused on 45 adequately studied cases published since 1883. The experimental study consisted of administering standard tests of music and environmental sound recognition to 40 unselected patients with unilateral stroke. Among case reports, music was selectively impaired more frequently than environmental sounds, whereas the reverse occurred in the experimental study. In this, right hemisphere lesions tended either to disrupt the apperception of environmental sounds, sparing music entirely, or to disrupt both environmental sounds and melody, sparing rhythm, whereas left hemisphere lesions tended to spare melody and to disrupt rhythm, either selectively or in association with the semantic identification of environmental sounds.",{},,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,10.1196/annals.1284.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
30878181,Prominent auditory deficits in primary progressive aphasia: A case study.,"Utianski, Rene L; Duffy, Joseph R; Clark, Heather M; Machulda, Mary M; Dickson, Dennis W; Whitwell, Jennifer L; Josephs, Keith A",Utianski,"Aphasia typically is associated with comparable difficulties in written and spoken modalities of language expression and comprehension. In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia is the disproportionate difficulty comprehending spoken compared to written language, also typically greater than difficulties with spoken and written language expression, in the absence of a primary sensory deficit. The terms pure word deafness and auditory verbal agnosia are often used synonymously. However, the broader term of auditory agnosia more accurately reflects difficulty processing both speech and non-speech sounds whereas individuals with auditory verbal agnosia (pure word deafness) have preserved processing of environmental sounds. Auditory agnosia is reported in the stroke literature, but rarely reported in progressive neurologic disorders. Here, we report a case of a woman who presented with what is best described as a prominent auditory deficit in the context of an initially unclassifiable, or mixed, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with accompanying apraxia of speech. Her clinical presentation shared features with auditory agnosia, although sensory functioning was not formally assessed. We report clinical and neuroimaging data spanning 6 years and subsequent autopsy results. She presented at 65 years of age, 5 years post onset of symptoms that included insidious and progressive difficulties thinking of words, constructing sentences, pronouncing words, and understanding instructions. She had disproportionate difficulty with comprehension of spoken compared to written language. She eventually developed features of the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA, as well as an apraxia of speech. Imaging with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed progression of bilateral (left greater than right) hypometabolism involving the frontal, temporal (predominantly the lateral superior gyrus), and parietal lobes, that eventually included the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and caudate.

We verified that the patient exhibited persistent and severe auditory agnosia for nonverbal sounds in the absence of verbal comprehension deficits or peripheral hearing problems. Acoustical analyses suggested that his residual processing of a minority of environmental sounds might rely on his speech processing abilities. In the patient's brain, contralateral (right) temporal cortex as well as perilesional (left) anterior temporal cortex were strongly responsive to verbal, but not to nonverbal sounds, a pattern that stands in marked contrast to the controls' data.

Two months after hospitalization, he regained his ability to understand some verbal words. Six months after hospitalization, his ability to understand verbal language was improved to an understandable level when speaking slowly in front of his eyes, but his comprehension of verbal sound language was still word level, not sentence level.

This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task-a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation-demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.10.023,PMC7856551,Audition; Misophonia; Music; Segregation; Speech perception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

The simultaneous recording of the whole auditory-evoked response pattern revealed no abnormality in the early components, which reflect the activation of the auditory nuclei and pathways of the brain stem. However, the middle and late components were delayed and slowed. These results and others in the literature suggest that the neocortex in man, as in other mammals, plays an essential role in the temporal aspects of hearing.

Auditory agnosia is usually considered as a sign of a bitemporal cortical or subcortical disorder, but, in our patient, a brainstem disorder caused a disturbance of auditory recognition similar to auditory agnosia due to a bitemporal lesion. Our patient's auditory findings may belong to the category of a brainstem auditory-processing disorder brought on by a small hemorrhage in the inferior colliculi. In addition, the impairment in our patient implies that, in the neural processing of musical parameters, the decoding of intensity, tone and rhythm is accomplished at the level of inferior colliculus, whereas further cortical processing is necessary for the appropriate recognition of melody.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00261-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

In view of recent promising results in the area of neurorehabilitation of language disorders after stroke, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a young woman with general auditory agnosia caused by traumatic injury to the left inferior colliculus. Specifically, we studied activations to sound embedded in a block design using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after application of anodal tDCS to the right auditory cortex. Before tDCS, auditory discrimination deficits were associated with abnormally reduced activations of the auditory cortex and bilateral unresponsiveness of the anterior superior temporal sulci and gyri. This session replicated a previous functional scan with the same paradigm a year before the current experiment. We then applied anodal tDCS over right auditory cortex for 20 min-utes and immediately re-scanned the patient. We found increased activation of bilateral auditory cortices and, for speech sounds, selectively increased activation in Broca's and Wernicke's areas.

Although clinical cases of cortical deafness have been reported, little is known about the hearing problems and localized lesions associated with cortical deafness. The aims of our research are to elucidate lesion sites associated with cortical deafness and to clarify why patients with cerebral lesions are not aware of any sound at all. Three patients diagnosed as having total loss of hearing participated in this study. We conducted pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose cortical deafness with aphasia tests of these patients. Our studies showed that waves VI and VII as well as waves I to V have normal peak latencies in ABRs in all three patients. In brain MRI, we found complete damage of proximal parts of bilateral auditory radiations in the three patients.

Presentation of this case is highly educational as APD is the single clinical manifestation of a large cerebellopontine and internal auditory canal lesion. A case report. The patient underwent a standard audiological evaluation with normal results. She was referred for APD evaluation. The APD test battery consisted of speech in babble (SinB), dichotic digits (DD), frequency and duration of pattern sequence testing, Random Gap Detection Test, and gaps in noise. These were followed by otoacoustic emissions testing, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her auditory processing results showed deficits in SinB and DD limited to the right ear as well as deficits in temporal processing. Both verbal and nonverbal tests exhibited deficits strictly limited to the right ear, which was in accordance with what she was experiencing as reduced loudness for the incoming sounds on the right ear. This less costly evaluation revealed that there was good reason to assess electrophysiologically the auditory system. ABR showed an abnormal waveform with either missing or severely prolongated wave V (depending on stimulus polarity). Otoacoustic emissions were normal. MRI was then implemented revealing a large cerebellopontine and internal auditory canal lesion. This clinical case stresses the importance of testing for APD with a psychoacoustical test battery despite current debate of lack of a gold standard diagnostic approach to APD. In this case, APD diagnosis led to a cerebellopontine lesion identification with extension to the right internal auditory canal. This rare cause of APD demonstrates the efficiency of the current diagnostic test battery in revealing lesional causes of central APD.",{},,Journal of the American Academy of Audiology,10.3766/jaaa.15127,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Psychoacoustic and lesion studies suggest that there is a widely distributed cortical network involved in processing discreet musical variables. Here we present the case of a young man with auditory agnosia as the consequence of cortical neurodegeneration who continues to experience pleasure when exposed to music. In a series of musical tasks, the subject was unable to accurately identify any of the perceptual components of music beyond simple pitch discrimination, including musical variables known to impact the perception of affect. The subject subsequently misidentified the musical character of personally familiar tunes presented experimentally, but continued to report that the activity of 'listening' to specific musical genres was an emotionally rewarding experience.

Comprehensive follow-up examinations of auditory function were periodically conducted until his sudden death 15 years later. His brain was studied postmortem for neuropathology. Initial pure-tone audiometry revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. However, repeated pure-tone audiometry revealed that thresholds became progressively poorer over time, bilaterally. Speech audiometry of both ears consistently revealed that the patient was unable to discriminate any monosyllabic words (i.e. speech intelligibility scores were 0%, bilaterally). In general, speech and hearing tests demonstrated that he could not comprehend spoken words, but could comprehend written commands and gestures. Postmortem neuropathological study of the left hemisphere revealed total defect and neuronal loss of the superior temporal gyrus, including Heschl's gyrus, and total gliosis of the medial geniculate body. In the right hemisphere, examination revealed subcortical necrosis, gliosis in the centre of the superior temporal gyrus and partial gliosis of the medial geniculate body.

The results of audiological studies on temporal discrimination were similar to those described for bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The relationships between click intervals and the threshold to detect sound, and between numbers of clicks and the threshold, were also examined. We observed a tendency for the threshold to decline as the number of clicks was increased or the interval between two clicks was shortened.

For vowel classification, both superior temporal plane (STP) and STS areas have been suggested relevant. Lesion of bilateral STS may conversely be expected to cause pure word deafness and possibly also impaired vowel classification. Here we studied a patient with bilateral STS lesions caused by ischemic strokes and relatively intact medial STPs to characterize the behavioral consequences of STS loss. The patient showed severe deficits in auditory speech perception, whereas his speech production was fluent and communication by written speech was grossly intact. Auditory-evoked fields in the STP were within normal limits on both sides, suggesting that major parts of the auditory cortex were functionally intact. Further studies showed that the patient had normal hearing thresholds and only mild disability in tests for telencephalic hearing disorder. Prominent deficits were discovered in an auditory-object classification task, where the patient performed four standard deviations below the control group. In marked contrast, performance in a vowel-classification task was intact. Auditory evoked fields showed enhanced responses for vowels compared to matched non-vowels within normal limits. Our results are consistent with the notion that cortex along STS is important for auditory speech perception, although it does not appear to be entirely speech specific. Formant analysis and single vowel classification, however, appear to be already implemented in auditory cortex on the STP.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.08.001,,Auditory agnosia; Auditory cortex; Pure word deafness; Speech perception; Superior temporal sulcus; Vowel,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

He was diagnosed as having auditory agnosia caused by bilateral temporal lobe injury. We began to train him at once, individually and intensively. Adult patients with pure auditory agnosia followed by two episodes of temporal lobe infarction have impairment in central hearing but not inner language. Therefore, they can communicate by reading and writing. Moreover, impairment in hearing is not always severe and is often transient. However, despite long-term (more than 15 years) energetic education and almost normal intellectual ability (Performance IQ of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised was 91), our patient's language ability was extremely poor.

We have investigated these capacities in a patient (NM) who complained having difficulties to localise sounds in everyday life after a right temporo-parieto-frontal ischemic lesion. Two groups of tasks were used, in which spatial dimension was simulated by interaural time differences (ITD): (i) active localisation of stationary or moving sound targets, and (ii) sound segregation on the basis of spatial cues. This latter included a spatial release from masking paradigm and two ITD diotic tasks. NM failed to localise stationary and moving sounds: she perceived all the stimuli at the centre of the head, and could not differentiate stationary from moving targets. In contrast, NM was able to use ITD cues to segregate simultaneous sound sources in the spatial-release-from-masking paradigm and in ITD diotic tasks.These results suggest that sound localisation and sound object segregation based on spatial cues do not rely on the same mechanisms.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00014-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The clinical picture started with cortical deafness, then changed to generalized auditory agnosia for verbal and environmental sounds, and finally developed into auditory agnosia confined to the perception of environmental sounds. Her errors in a test of sound recognition were discriminative rather than associative in nature. Neuro-radiological examinations revealed bilateral subcortical lesions involving the fibers from the medial geniculate body to the temporal lobes after bilateral putaminal hemorrhage.

17565219,A case of auditory agnosia with impairment of perception and expression of music: cognitive processing of tonality.,"Satoh, Masayuki; Takeda, Katsuhiko; Kuzuhara, Shigeki",Satoh,"There is fairly general agreement that the melody and the rhythm are the independent components of the perception of music. In the theory of music, the melody and harmony determine to which tonality the music belongs. It remains an unsettled question whether the tonality is also an independent component of the perception of music, or a by-product of the melody and harmony. We describe a patient with auditory agnosia and expressive amusia that developed after a bilateral infarction of the temporal lobes. We carried out a detailed examination of musical ability in the patient and in control subjects. Comparing with a control population, we identified the following impairments in music perception: (a) discrimination of familiar melodies; (b) discrimination of unfamiliar phrases, and (c) discrimination of isolated chords. His performance in pitch discrimination and tonality were within normal limits. Although intrasubject statistical analysis revealed significant difference only between tonality task and unfamiliar phrase performance, comparison with control subjects suggested a dissociation between a preserved tonality analysis and impairment of perception of melody and chords. By comparing the results of our patient with those in the literature, we may say that there is a double dissociation between the tonality and the other components. Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose that tonality is an independent component of music perception. Based on our present and previous studies, we proposed the revised version of the cognitive model of musical processing in the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,European neurology,10.1159/000103640,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

She presented with impairment of musical perception that was especially pronounced in discriminating timbre and loudness but also in discriminating pitch, and a severely impaired ability to reproduce the pitch just presented. In contrast, language and motor disturbances were almost entirely absent. By comparing her pre- and post-stroke singing, we were able to show that her singing after the stroke lacked the fine control of the subtle stress and pitch changes that characterized her pre-stroke singing. Such impairment could not be explained by the impairment of pitch perception. The findings suggest that damage to the right temporoparietal cortex is enough to produce both perceptive and expressive deficits in music.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.013,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the 3rd month, despite significant hippocampal structural damage on imaging, only a milder degree of retrograde and anterograde amnesia persisted on detailed neuropsychological examination. On systematic testing of recognition of facial and vocal expression of emotion, we found an impairment of the vocal perception of fear, but not that of other emotions, such as joy, sadness and anger. Such selective impairment of fear perception was not present in the recognition of facial expression of emotion. Thus emotional perception varies according to the different aspects of emotions and the different modality of presentation (faces versus voices). This is consistent with the idea that there may be multiple emotion systems. The study of emotional perception in this unique case of bilateral involvement of hippocampus suggests that this structure may play a critical role in the recognition of fear in vocal expression, possibly dissociated from that of other emotions and from that of fear in facial expression. In regard of recent data suggesting that the amygdala is playing a role in the recognition of fear in the auditory as well as in the visual modality this could suggest that the hippocampus may be part of the auditory pathway of fear recognition.",{},,European neurology,10.1159/000113394,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

The patient and a group of six normal volunteers were scanned in the following three conditions: (i) passive listening to environmental sounds; (ii) categorization of environmental sounds; (iii) at rest. In normal subjects, passive listening as compared with rest was associated with significant activations in the auditory cortices and posterior thalami, and in the inferior parietal lobe and anterior insula/frontal opercular region on the right. In J.B., activations were observed in the spared auditory cortex and inferior parietal lobe of the right hemisphere and in regions adjacent to the perisylvian lesion in the left hemisphere (anterior insula/frontal opercular region, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe). The recovered function, as measured by categorization of sounds compared with passive listening, in J.B. was associated with bilateral activation of a distributed network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices, as well as the right cerebellum and the right caudate nucleus. In addition, there was a left-sided activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus. In normal subjects, the same categorization task led to activation of a network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices in the left hemisphere only. These results suggest that bilateral activation (with recruitment of areas homologous to those known to be responsible for normal function), the engagement of peri-infarct regions, and the involvement of a more widespread neocortical network, are mechanisms of functional reorganization after injury that may enable recovery from, or compensation for, cognitive deficits.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/118.6.1395,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Confusion has arisen with regard to the usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term ""word deafness"" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits.

The severity of neglect was documented using pure tones, speech, and environmental stimuli, administered binaurally and dichotically. Acuity examination and unilateral presentation of stimuli allowed exclusion of primary hearing deficit. A dichotic word test was used to evaluate the effects of implicit and explicit cuing. Contrary to our expectations, implicit semantic cues did not attenuate the neglect, and explicit manipulation of sound volume, consisting of increasing the volume in the left ear while maintaining right ear volume at a minimum did not increase the perception of neglected stimuli on the left. Explicit commands to selectively attend to the left ear also failed to improve left ear perception. These findings suggest that some manifestations of auditory neglect are not affected by attributes of the sound stimulus. Furthermore, the finding that manipulation of sound volume had no influence on the neglect supports the hypothesis that sound volume is perceived by the brain as encoded information and not as a simple analogue representation of sound magnitude mediated by variance in the firing rate of neurons in the auditory nerve.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802108406,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Identical positron emission tomography studies, conducted nine months apart, revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of auditory cortex in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging examination at the time of the second session revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension.

Most of these symptoms, with the obvious exception of aphasia, are similar to those observed by Kluver and Bucy in rhesus monkeys that underwent bitemporal lobectomy. These manifestations may be explained by the tendency of the herpes simplex virus to invade the temporal lobes. ""Agnosia"" in the auditory field and changes in vocal behavior were observed by H. Kluver and P. C. Bucy (1939, Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 42, 949-1000) in some of their bitemporal monkeys. The association of sensory aphasia, as observed in this case, with the auditory ""agnosia"" observed in some bitemporal monkeys, is discussed.",{},,Brain and language,10.1016/0093-934x(84)90069-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

10857685,Musical instrument naming impairments: the crucial exception to the living/nonliving dichotomy in category-specific agnosia.,"Dixon, M J; Piskopos, M; Schweizer, T A",Dixon,"In category-specific agnosia (CSA) patients typically have more trouble naming animals, fruits, and vegetables than tools, furniture, and articles of clothing. A crucial exception to this living vs nonliving rule involves the category of musical instruments. Patients with problems naming living objects often repeatedly fail to name musical instruments. In CSA it is crucial to equate living and nonliving object lists on object name frequency, complexity, and familiarity. The present study shows, however, that even the most rigorously controlled object lists can lead to erroneous conclusions if nonliving stimuli contain an overrepresentation of musical instruments. Naming capabilities of a herpes encephalitis patient were assessed using matched lists of living and nonliving objects and showed no indication of category-specific deficits. When exemplars were separated into biological objects, musical instruments and man-made artifacts, strong category-specificity emerged: artifact naming was flawless whereas musical instrument and biological object naming were both severely impaired. It is concluded that CSA is a veridical phenomenon but that our understanding of CSA is limited by adhering to the spurious living/nonliving distinction.",{},,Brain and cognition,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

A case report and an attempt of neuropsychological qualification (author's transl)].,"Ulrich, G",Ulrich,"Proceeding from the neuropsychological examination of a patient with an exceptionally selective impairment of auditory gnosis of vascular origin, we make an attempt to analyze structurally the syndrome of auditory agnosia, a study of which has been neglected in comparison with analyses of visual agnosia. In our analysis we refer to 28 case reports, documented in the literature. Decisive syndromal points of view are: a) there is an absence of significant audiological deficiencies; b) errors of the acoustic-discriminative type prevail in auditory-visual matching tasks; c) the gnostic deficit is modality specific; d) the same items are variably reproduced on repeated presentation; e) there is marked fluctuation of performance; f) there is exceptional irreversibility of the impairment; g) amusia is a more or less obligatory accompanying phenomenon; h) in cases of vascular origin there is always a history of repeated temporal lobe damage, this damage being predominantly in the form of bilateral lesions. This analysis indicates a close structural analogy to the syndrome of perceptive visual agnosia. We place great importance in the relationship between approaches and models of cognitive psychology (Neisser, 1967) which we see as important for further theoretical development in neuropsychology.",{},,Archiv fur Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger

He could recognize Arabic music and instruments but not words of songs; a radio broadcast from the Koran, but not the individual words; a male as opposed to female voice; Arabic and non-Arabic languages; and whether sentences were questions, exclamations, or imperatives. He discerned whether the speaker was emotionally neutral, happy, angry or sad. Contextual cues and reducing the rate of speaking aided verbal comprehension. Pure tone threshhold audiometry revealed mild bilateral sensorineural loss up to 2000 Hz and a moderate high frequency loss. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials were normal, cortical auditory evoked potentials abnormal. CT scan revealed bilateral infarcts subcortically just posterior to the left superior temporal gyrus and the right posterior superior and midtemporal regions. Neurolinguistic tests indicated that the deficit is prephonemic and not due to impairment of linguistic discrimination.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/111.2.457,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Besides, she presented language disorders of aphasic type relating to a sensorial transcortical aphasia. The case meets the diagnostic criteria for crossed aphasia. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a right temporo-parietal infarct. There was no sensorial or peripheral auditive disorder and no auditory agnosia of non verbal modality. During the evolution, the aphasic symptoms diminished partially and the subjective auditory deficit of the left ear continued. The integrated auditory evaluation (neuroacoustic test, study of auditory gnosia, dichotic listening test, evoked cortical auditory potentials) allowed the evidence of the characteristic disturbances of a right hemianacousia: loss of left hear in dichotic audition, decrease of amplitude of evoked right cortical auditory potentials. In the light of theories concerning auditory integration, one can explain this evolution. The initial aphasic comprehension disturbance expresses the alteration of the linguistic treatment of auditory information of the dominant hemisphere, here the right hemisphere. Subsequently, the linguistic disturbance regresses largely, letting persist the change of general auditory treatment. The representation of this general auditory treatment is hemispheric bilateral, the only right hemispheric damage shall result in hemianacousia.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Elevated levels of arsenic were found in the urine and hair. The patient received chelation treatment with British anti-Lewisite; substantial amounts of arsenic were excreted and the toxic encephalopathy improved gradually over the 8-month follow-up period. The patient was tested at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 8 months postdelirium with a battery of neuropsychological tasks. The pattern of results showed verbal learning and memory to be severely impaired while tests of general intellectual abilities and language remained unaffected. Follow-up examinations with no subsequent reexposure revealed improvements on specific cognitive tasks. It is unclear whether recovery of cortical functions occurred or if compensatory strategies were developed. It is proposed that a subacute exposure to arsenic may have contributed to the neuropsychological deficits.",{},,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

6648195,[Agraphia and preservation of music writing in a bilingual piano teacher].,"Assal, G; Buttet, J",Assal,"A bilingual virtuoso piano teacher developed aphasia and amusia, probably due to cerebral embolism. The perfectly demarcated and unique lesion was located in the left posterior temporoparietal region. Language examinations in French and Italian demonstrated entirely comparable difficulties in both languages. The linguistic course was favorable after a period of auditory agnosia and global aphasia. Language became fluent again 3 months after the onset, with a marked vocabulary loss and phonemic paraphasias with attempts at self-correction. Repetition was altered markedly with a deficit in auditory comprehension but no remaining elements of auditory agnosia. Reading was possible, but with some difficulty and total agraphia and acalculia persisted. Musical ability was better conserved, particularly with respect to repetition and above all to writing, the sparing of the latter constituting a fairly uncommon dissociation in relation to agraphia.

18379455,[Amusia and its topic specification].,"Buklina, S B; Skvortsova, V B",Buklina,"A historical development of views on amusia and its clinical phenomenology is reviewed. The authors present a case of atypical amusia in a patient aged 32 years with glioma of the right temporal lobe including the upper temporal gyrus. Amusia was combined with euphoria and disturbances of evaluation of speech intonation. It has been assumed that different mechanisms implicated with different regions of both brain hemispheres may underlie amusia. Sometimes these mechanisms appear to be universal, e.g. disorders of symbolic gnosis in posterior hemisphere lesions, being comorbid with amusia as disturbances in reading music and letter agnosia. In our case, the right temporal lobe lesion, especially with involvement of the upper temporal gyrus, caused specific music agnosia with disturbances of perception of some notes and duration of their phonation or a musical contour of the whole melody. Motor amusia is developed due to additional disturbances of motor and premotor brain functions, with significant contribution of the Broca's speech area. Music may be a model for investigation into processes of multimodal integration and hemisphere interaction.",{},,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

7115592,[A case of hysterical deafness].,"Takamori, A; Kaga, K; Shindo, M; Nakagawa, K",Takamori,"A forty years old woman with hysterical deafness is reported. Chief complaints were bilateral hearing loss. Nothing particular was found in her past and family history. In 1977, on the 11th day of May, she was admitted to A city hospital because of headache and paresis of right limb. As angiography revealed an aneurysms of her anterior communicating artery, she was undertaken the surgery of clipping and coating of the aneurysms. Post-operatively, left hemiparalysis appeared and paresis of right limb developed because of spasm of right middle cerebral artery. On the 14th day of August, ventricular-peritoneal shunt's operation was performed. As soon as she recovered from postoperative coma, she complained of bilateral hearing loss. Because pure tone audiometry demonstrated complete loss of her hearing, she was referred to ENT department of Teikyo University Hospital. Findings were as follows: 1) She had a queer way of hearing because she could understand to hear limited persons' speech (her doctor and husband). 2) Pure tone audiometry showed complete loss of her hearing but the thresholds of auditory brain stem responses were 15 dB and those of slow vertex responses were 45 dB. These results suggested no lesion in cochlea and brain stem. 3) Rorschach test and sentence complete test were performed. The results of these tests suggested hysterical state or neurotic state. 4) Total intelligent quotients by WAIS were 69 which indicated borderline level. However, this value appeared to be incorrect because she was uncooperative. 5) CT scan revealed low density areas at right temporo-parietal lobes and left temporal lobe which were localized and small. Our findings suggested hysterical deafness but not auditory agnosia. During three years, she was referred to several hospitals for rehabilitation but didn't become well at all. On the third year of the onset, her husband became sick and admitted to her room of the same hospital. During that period, suddenly, she talked her hearing to improve and the pure tone audiometry demonstrated decrease in threshold. In conclusion, this event could give a final diagnosis of hysterical deafness but not auditory agnosia.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
