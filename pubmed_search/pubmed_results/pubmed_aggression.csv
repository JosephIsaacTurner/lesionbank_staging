26039843,Neurobehavioral assessment.,"Kaufer, Daniel I",Kaufer,"This article presents a multidimensional, integrative approach to clinical assessment and management of neurobehavioral disorders. Behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry has grown as a subspecialty along with increased recognition of two common brain disorders: dementia and traumatic brain injury. Alzheimer disease is a highly prevalent dementia and a prototypical memory disorder, which has led to a primary focus on cognitive screening and assessment. By contrast, recent attention concerning possible long-term sequelae of repetitive traumatic brain injury has emphasized aberrant behavior (eg, depression, impulsivity, aggression). Clinical phenotyping across cognitive and behavioral dimensions, in conjunction with advancements in structural and functional neuroimaging, brain electrophysiologic techniques, and molecular genetics, is essential to improve diagnostic precision and therapeutic targeting along the spectrum of CNS disorders. All neurologists benefit from honing their clinical skills in neurobehavioral assessment. A systematic approach to cognitive and behavioral assessment increases differential diagnostic specificity, helps focus appropriate therapeutic interventions, and improves the quality of life for patients and their families. This article highlights practical approaches to neurobehavioral assessment in support of differential diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in general neurology practice.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/01.CON.0000466655.51790.2f,,,Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
19667003,Carbamazepine-induced hyperammonemia.,"Adams, Erin N; Marks, Alla; Lizer, Mitsi H",Adams,"A case of carbamazepine-induced hyperammonemia is presented. A 26-year-old man with bipolar disorder, seizures, and mild mental retardation secondary to a traumatic brain injury began treatment with carbamazepine for aggression and seizure control. After three weeks of carbamazepine therapy, the patient arrived at the emergency department (ED) with severe agitation and aggressive behavior. His oral medications included topiramate, carbamazepine, olanzapine, quetiapine, guanfacine, and desmopressin acetate. The patient's medications had been stable for at least six months except for the addition of carbamazepine one month before his arrival at the ED. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were found to be within normal limits, as were his liver profile results, complete blood count, thyroid-stimulating-hormone level, and serum chemistry panel. His serum carbamazepine concentration was 3.9 microg/mL (reference range, 4-12 microg/mL), and his serum ammonia concentration was 127 microg/dL (reference range, 19-60 microg/dL). Carbamazepine was discontinued upon admission, and the patient was treated with oral lactulose. Since carbamazepine was discontinued and had been prescribed for bipolar disorder, his olanzapine dosage was increased, and trazodone was added at bedtime for insomnia. Of note, the patient had been on carbamazepine therapy one year earlier and had experienced the same adverse event. He had also developed elevated serum ammonia levels while on valproic acid. The patient's serum ammonia level returned to normal by hospital day 4, and he was discharged to his group home. A 26-year-old man with bipolar disorder developed hyperammonemia three weeks after initiating carbamazepine therapy.",{},,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,10.2146/ajhp080454,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
34805004,Intraosseous meningioma mimicking osteosarcoma.,"Delgado, Ruben; Bahmad, Hisham F; Bhatia, Vinay; Kantrowitz, Allen B; Vincentelli, Cristina",Delgado,"Predominantly intraosseous meningiomas are rare entities that include true primary intraosseous meningiomas (PIM), as well as meningiomas that may show extensive bone involvement, such as <i>en plaque</i> meningiomas. Different hypotheses have been proposed to decipher the origin of PIMs, such as ectopic arachnoid cap cell entrapment during birth or after trauma. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice of such lesions. We present a case of a 65-year-old man with an enlarging mass in the parieto-occipital region that grew slowly and progressively over 13 years, following head trauma during a motor vehicle accident. One year prior to presentation, he started experiencing daily holocranial headaches and blurry vision. CT and MRI studies revealed a permeative midline calvarial lesion measuring 14 cm in greatest dimension with extensive periosteal reaction, extension into the subcutaneous soft tissues, subjacent dural thickening and intracranial extension with invasion of the superior sagittal sinus. The favored pre-operative clinical diagnosis was osteosarcoma. The abnormal calvarium was excised and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a predominantly intraosseous calvarial meningioma, WHO grade I. The present case highlights the importance of histopathologic diagnosis in guiding therapeutic decisions and reiterates the necessity of considering PIM or meningiomas with extensive intraosseous component in the differential diagnosis of calvarial masses, even when imaging suggests a neoplasm with aggressive behavior, such as osteosarcoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Autopsy & case reports,10.4322/acr.2021.332,PMC8597780,Case Reports; Meningioma; Osteosarcoma; Skull,Case Reports,Brazil,eng

Symptoms may be due to tumor treatment, the disease itself, or due to therapy for symptoms such as seizures. Levetiracetam is an attractive choice of antiepileptic medication because of relatively fewer drug interactions and may be administered through the subcutaneous route. Aggressive behavior in advanced brain tumors can have a profound negative impact on patients and their families and carers, particularly when deteriorating toward death. We report a case of neuropsychiatric symptoms in progressive glioblastoma multiforme while on stable levetiracetam doses, which improved with reduction and cessation of the drug. We review the existing literature on seizures in primary brain tumors, their antiepileptic drug management, and the risk of consequent neuropsychiatric adverse events.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of palliative medicine,10.1089/jpm.2019.0347,,epilepsy; levetiracetam; neuropsychiatric; primary brain tumor; seizure,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

On presentation, he was confused with altered mental status, aggressive behavior, and a Glasgow coma scale score of 10/15. Laboratory investigation, brain computed tomography (CT), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were unremarkable with normal results. Although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, we found increased concentrations of positive immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG antibodies in CSF, suggesting acute central nervous system (CNS) infection and indirect confirmation of virus neuroinvasion. There was no evidence of humoral auto-reactivity, and we rejected the hypothesis of autoimmune encephalitis with known autoantibodies. On the fifth day of hospitalization, myoclonic jerks emerged as a new neurological sign until the added levetiracetam led to total remission. The patient achieved full recovery after antiviral and corticosteroid therapy implementation of 10 days in the hospital.

The aim of this article is to update and summarize the relevant literature on penetrating craniocerebral screwdriver stab wounds and to report a new case of screwdriver assault. A number of studies were reviewed to investigate the incidence, distribution, common findings, mechanism of injury, differential diagnostic criteria, complications, treatment, and prognosis of craniocerebral screwdriver stab injuries. It was observed that the degree of traumatic severity depends on the cross-sectional area of the screwdriver and the anatomical region of injury. Craniocerebral screwdriver injuries are mainly cases of interpersonal violence and the mortality rate is approximately 47.6%. In 23.8% of the incidents, the trauma is overlooked on admission because of the small entry wound and, thus, the severity of the injury is not initially appreciated.",{},,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,10.1097/PAF.0000000000000267,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
35282555,Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Aggressive Behavior.,"Kazi, Sana Elham; Anwar, Adeel",Kazi,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells.  Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.21978,PMC8906197,aggressive behavior; aphasia; cannabis use; dextromethorphan-quinidine; pseudobular afffect; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

38255080,Traumatic Aneurysm Involving the Posterior Communicating Artery.,"Napoletano, Gabriele; Di Fazio, Nicola; Delogu, Giuseppe; Del Duca, Fabio; Maiese, Aniello",Napoletano,"Traumatic intracranial aneurysms (TICAs) are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all intracranial aneurysms. However, they are associated with a mortality rate of over 50%. The case presented herein focuses on a posterior communicating artery TICA caused by violent aggression. A 41-year-old man with massive subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), on admission to hospital, had a CT angiography that showed a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm with continuous blood loss and underwent neurosurgical cooling. The CT scan also showed fractures of the mandible, mastoid and left styloid process, as well as brain contusions caused by blows and kicks. Despite medical treatment and surgery, after four days, he died. The assault dynamics were recorded by a camera in the bar. The damage was caused by kicks to the neck and head. The forensic neuropathological examination showed the primary injury (SAH, subdural hemorrhage, cerebral contusions, head-neck fractures), as well as secondary damage following the attack (cerebral infarcts, edema, supratentorial hernia, midbrain hemorrhage). The coil was intact and well positioned. In this case, circumstantial information, medical records, and the type of injury could shed light on the mechanism of the production of a TICA. In addition, the CT angiography and histological investigations helped to distinguish a recent and traumatic aneurysm from a pre-existing one. Following precise steps, the study of aneurysms can be helpful in clarifying their traumatic origin even when the victim was taking drugs. The aim of this study is also to share the diagnostic process that we used in the forensic field for the assessment of suspected traumatic aneurysms.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/healthcare12020192,PMC10815069,aneurysm rupture; cerebral angiography; forensic neuropathology; traumatic brain injury; traumatic intracranial aneurysm,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

However, the use of amantadine for the subjective alleviation of fatigue in multiple sclerosis and in the treatment of agitated aggressive behavior in the traumatic brain injured patient has also been described. Side effects of amantadine are primarily related to the central nervous system and include hallucinations, confusion, and nightmares. Toxic manifestations include acute psychosis, coma, cardiovascular toxicity, and death. Amantadine toxicity is a particular problem in patients with renal insufficiency because 90% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. We present a case of amantadine-induced coma in a patient with multiple sclerosis and end-stage renal disease.

His deficit of fear recognition was not linked to evidence of any problem in recognizing anger (a common feature in other reports), but for his everyday experience of emotion N.M. reported reduced anger and fear compared with neurologically normal controls. These findings show a specific deficit compromising the recognition of the emotion of fear from a wide range of social signals, and suggest a possible relationship of this type of impairment with alterations of emotional experience.",{},,Proceedings.

28367383,Multiple Calcifying Pseudoneoplasms of the Neuraxis.,"Brasiliense, Leonardo B; Dickson, Dennis W; Nakhleh, Raouf E; Tawk, Rabih G; Wharen, Robert",Brasiliense,"Calcifying pseudoneoplasms of the neuraxis (CAPNONs) are extremely rare tumors that are frequently misdiagnosed and overlooked by clinicians. To date, only 40 intracranial lesions have been reported, and in all instances, they were found as a solitary calcified mass. To our knowledge, the current case report is the first to illustrate the development of multiple intraaxial CAPNONs and shed more light on the origin of these lesions. We discuss the case of a 67-year-old woman who presented with a six-year history of recurrent seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed two similar heterogeneous intracranial masses in the ventral midbrain and left frontal white matter with indications of more aggressive behavior in the supratentorial tumor. The lesion was resected, and histopathological analysis showed tissue containing nodules of chondromyxoid material with a coarsely fibrillar matrix and focal alveolar pattern. Palisading cells were noted around the edges as well as dystrophic calcifications and osseous metaplasia, consistent with CAPNON. Interestingly, the patient had a previous history of multiple brain abscesses and a mycotic aneurysm. At her four-month follow-up visit, the patient remained seizure-free and there were no indications of residual tumor or recurrence. In contrast to previous reports, intracranial CAPNONs may manifest as multiple lesions and clinicians should include these tumors in the differential diagnosis of intra-axial calcified masses. The previous history of brain abscesses raises the suspicion of an abnormal proliferative process following an insult to the brain tissue as the underlying origin of these lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.1044,PMC5360384,benign; calcified pseudoneoplasm; supratentorial; tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

A qualitative analysis of clinical situations could highlight the relevance of psychotherapy care. In January 2005, this 24-year-old patient sustained severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow at 4/15), with bilateral frontotemporal injury and temporal extradural hematoma. On the third day, a temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient's evolution showed severe neurobehavioral disorders, with agitation and aggressive behavior towards family members and medical caregivers. Maximum doses of antipsychotic drugs brought no improvement. Antidepressant medication improved social contact. Several stays in the psychiatric unit, where institutionalized and psychotherapy care were implemented, showed systematically a real improvement of the behavioral disorders, increased participation in group activities and the ability to walk around alone in a closed environment. Aggressive behavior can unveil organic brain injuries, depressive syndrome as well as iatrogenic nature of the environment. This clinical case is based on the fact that antipsychotic drugs, aside from their sedative effect, are not the proper treatment for agitation following traumatic brain injury. This case also highlights how management of behavioral disorders following TBI should not be based on pharmacological treatments only but instead should focus on multidisciplinary strategies of care.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine,10.1016/j.rehab.2011.04.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng; fre

This article describes the effectiveness of behavior interventions derived from the assessment of behavior in a community-based setting. The premise is that behavior, no matter how difficult, has function, purpose, and meaning for the individual. A therapeutic model of behavior assessment is presented that bases its strength on behavior assessment and well-trained staff. A well-formulated behavior management plan is developed, reinforcing alternative behaviors teaching skills, and reducing unwanted behaviors. Through the use of data collection methods, the treatment team identifies variables related to unwanted behavior and outcomes of consequences as they relate to the behavior. Illustrated through a case study, the behavioral treatment model is defined through behavior identification, initial assessments, treatment approaches, and tracking outcomes.",{},,The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation,10.1097/00001199-200008000-00006,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

If unrecognized, this delayed hematoma can lead to devastating consequences. A 30-year-old patient with no past medical history, was brought to the emergency after a severe brain injury secondary to an aggression, Glasgow coma scale was 6 (E1V1 M4) with a left anisocoria. The CT scan revealed a left acute subdural hematoma with midline shift superior than 10 mm, and a non-surgical contralateral EDH was also identified. The patient was operated on urgently. Post-operatively, the pupils became equal sized and reactive. A right anisocoria was noticed 12 h later, with a large contralateral EDH on CT scan associated to a gross midline shift. A second operation was performed immediately with a good recovery and the patient was extubated one week post-operatively. The most common surgical complications after a decompressive craniectomy for an acute subdural hematoma noted in literature are surgical site herniation, post-operative infections, epilepsy, and subdural effusions with or without hydrocephalus. Contralateral epidural hematoma (EDH) after decompressive craniectomy is also documented (Ban et al., 2010; Nadig and King, 2012) [3,15]<b>, however it's rare with only 100 cases, including the present one reported.</b> Delayed contralateral EDH after decompressive surgery should be anticipated in the presence of contralateral skull fracture and/or intraoperative brain swelling and immediate postoperative scan is indicated.

Lateral surgical routes are becoming increasingly used to approach ventrolaterally brainstem cavernoma. Surgical approach decision depends on the location of the cavernoma in the brainstem and a possible association with brainstem developmental venous anomalies (DVAs). DVA can affect the formation and clinical course of cavernous malformation (CM). CMs related to DVAs tend to have more aggressive behavior than isolated CM. In cases of DVAs associated with hemorrhage, CMs are most often the site of bleeding rather than DVAs themselves. In this case report, we present a 24-year-old woman with a pontomedullary CM and associated dorsally located DVA. BCM was operated through a far lateral suboccipital craniotomy. Brainstem entry point was at inferior olive with extension to the pontomedullary sulcus. This approach should be preferred as a safe surgical exposure to the central and paramedian pontomedullary cavernoma, especially in the cases with associated intraparenchymal brainstem DVA.

To date, very few cases have been reported in association football players. To describe the clinicopathological features of a case of CTE in an 84-year-old former football player who was clinically diagnosed as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A retrospective review of the patient's primary care and hospital medical records was performed along with a comprehensive neuropathological examination. This patient presented at age 84 with symmetrical parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that was exacerbated by prochlorperazine. His condition was rapidly progressive with recurrent falls within 1 year. Other features included headaches, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, disturbed sleep and aggression. He received a clinical diagnosis of DLB and died approximately 2 years after the onset of symptoms. A post-mortem examination revealed stage 4 CTE. While the contemporaneous onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms in the context of possible neuroleptic sensitivity is suggestive of DLB, the additional symptoms of aggressive behavior, depression and suicidality in a former football player are consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE. This case, which is notable for the late presentation, demonstrates that CTE may masquerade as other dementias and highlights the importance of seeking a history of repetitive head impacts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Movement disorders clinical practice,10.1002/mdc3.13829,PMC10525051,chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia with Lewy bodies; football; pathology; soccer,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

A 58-year-old patient with an unlabeled polymalformative syndrome was admitted to the Emergency department following a head injury secondary to a self-resolving tonic-clonic epileptic seizure. The initial CT-scan was interpreted as a minor subcutaneous and epidural hematoma initially deemed for conservative management. Within 4 days, the patient showed a progressive neurological deterioration culminating into a stuporous status which prompted a constrast-enhanced brain MRI. The scan revealed a multilayered solid lesion, extending from the subgaleal compartment to the subdural space, threatening the integrity of overlying skin and causing infiltration of the brain parenchyma. Following emergency neurosurgical excision a definitive histology diagnosis of central follicular lymphoma was made. A focused chemotherapy with high-dose Methotrexate with R-CHOP protocol led to disease control until the latest follow up at 2 years. To our knowledge, this case represents the first CCFL invading the brain parenchyma and the second extending to the dura.

However, few studies have examined the efficacy of specific intervention strategies to reduce the frequency and intensity of anger outbursts. We therefore performed a single-case study on this topic by administering two successive and complementary psychological interventions with an AB design with maintenance (first intervention) and an AC design with maintenance plus a one-month follow-up (second intervention) to a patient with a severe TBI. Whereas the first intervention focused on improving the recognition and expression of basic emotions, the second consisted of a self-regulation programme, including various features such as psychoeducation about self-control strategies, relaxation and assertiveness training that aimed to establish adequate behaviours, which were further promoted by an implementation intentions strategy in the patient's daily life. The results indicated that all interventions resulted in a reduced frequency and intensity of anger outbursts, and the data upheld the specificity of these effects. In addition, a meta-analytic integration of the effects of both interventions on the outcomes indicated a medium effect size. Further research is needed on other patients who experience long-standing anger outbursts to examine whether the observed gains can be replicated, sustained on a longer-term basis and improved.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2016.1270837,,Traumatic brain injury; anger; emotion recognition; implementation intentions; single-case,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

When a CS dAVF with aggressive behavior is encountered, a radical cure is required to avoid catastrophic deficits. However, conventional transvenous cavernous sinus (CS) embolization via the inferior petrosal sinus does not always achieve shunt obliteration. We herein report a case of surgical venous drainage disconnection in an 83-year-old woman with a CS dAVF. The patient presented with coma and anisocoria due to intracranial hemorrhage. Because of the patient's critical condition, we had no choice but to perform emergency decompressive craniectomy and hematoma evacuation without detailed preoperative hemodynamic information obtained by digital subtraction angiography. Postoperative digital subtraction angiography showed a CS dAVF with retrograde venous drainage of the deep middle cerebral vein (DMCV) and varix formation in the affected DMCV, causing hemorrhagic episodes. Five days after admission, the patient's neurologic state worsened because of rebleeding from the varix, which had increased in size. The percutaneous transvenous approach failed because of compartmentalization within the CS. Open surgery was performed; the deep vasculature was exposed by the transsylvian approach, and the arterialized DMCV was permanently clipped at its proximal segment with disconnection from the venous varix and fistulous point. Shunt obliteration was successfully achieved.

We opted for complete resection of the meningioma and reconstruction with anterior rectus abdominis muscle flap, as well as selective cervical ganglionectomy. Anatomical pathology showed neoplastic proliferation of meningothelial cells in syncytial cytoplasm, oval or spherical nuclei with slight anisocariosis and hyperchromasia, and intranuclear vacuoles, all compatible with anaplastic meningioma. Due to a lack of consensus on how to treat a metastatic malignant meningioma, this pathology requires a multidisciplinary approach, and treatment needs to be adapted to each particular case. Complete resection of the lesion is the primary goal, and this requires complex procedures involving endocranial as well as extracranial surgeries, which result in composite defects difficult to resolve.

Immunotherapy emerged as a promising treatment in this setting. Brain metastasis from UTUC is unusual, occurring most often in the presence of systemic metastases. Local therapies such as stereotactic radiosurgery, neurosurgical resection and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) remain the main therapeutic options for brain metastasis. We report a case of a 65-year-old male patient presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of multiple brain metastasis. During an evaluation for the primary, he was found to be having metastatic UTUC of the renal pelvis. The brain metastases were treated by hippocampal sparing WBRT with minimal neurotoxicity. The primary tumor was treated by pembrolizumab.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of surgical case reports,10.1093/jscr/rjaa126,PMC7365028,brain; metastasis; renal pelvis; urothelial carcinoma,Case Reports,England,eng
35773951,Diagnostic Puzzle of Acute Ischemic Stroke Mimics - Seizure Versus Post-Stroke Recrudescence: A Case Report.,"Akintomide, Femi Akindotun; Hosseini, Reza; Candale-Radu, Claudia; Khan, Khurshid",Akintomide,"BACKGROUND Focal seizure with impaired awareness, post-seizure Todd's phenomenon, and post-stroke recrudescence can all present with focal neurological deficits, mimicking stroke. As acute ischemic stroke mimics, they are distractors in the emergency setting where management is time-sensitive both for seizure and stroke. Nevertheless, a timely diagnosis can be made with exploration of the clinical features supported by investigation such as computerized tomographic perfusion. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 65-year-old woman who was known hypertensive, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous intracerebral hemorrhage with minimal right-sided residual deficits, but still able to ambulate independently. She was brought to the Emergency Department because 1 hour prior to presentation, she had sudden worsening of weakness of the right limbs, aphasia, aggression, and confusion. An initial impression of repeat acute stroke, focal seizure with impaired awareness, Todd's phenomenon, and post-stroke recrudescence was considered. While CT angiography was suggestive of left middle cerebral artery occlusion, CT perfusion revealed extensive hypoperfusion patterns beyond the region of the occlusion, thus suggesting a different etiology from acute ischemic stroke. In view of her previous left hemispheric lesion coupled with the presentation, our working diagnosis was seizure with Todd's phenomenon, and she was started on an anti-epileptic drug. Her condition returned to baseline within 24 h of admission and was subsequently discharged. CONCLUSIONS Our case demonstrates that adequate elucidation of clinical features in conjunction with CT perfusion, as a dual-purpose tool, can aid the diagnosis of both stroke mimics and acute ischemic stroke in the Emergency Department where rapid treatment is essential.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936826,PMC9253856,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here, we report a series of 4 cases of this rare event and discuss the relevant potential risk factors. We performed a retrospective review of patients treated for scalp metastases of meningiomas at our institution. A literature review was performed for the terms ""scalp meningioma,"" ""cutaneous meningioma,"" ""skin meningioma,"" ""extracranial meningioma,"" and ""subcutaneous meningioma."" Four patients showed scalp metastases of recurrent meningiomas with the following associated clinical features: multiple reoperations (n = 4), immunosuppression (n = 2), radiation therapy (n = 3), surgical wound complications with cerebrospinal fluid fistula (n = 2), and histologic grade progression (n = 2). The timescale for development of scalp metastasis was between 5 months and 13 years after intracranial meningioma surgery. In all cases, the metastases were located close to the surgical scalp incision for the craniotomy. Previously, 11 cases of meningioma with scalp metastasis, with similar features to those described here, were reported in the literature. Spreading of meningioma cells during surgery is a possible mechanism for scalp metastases of recurrent meningiomas. Factors associated with scalp metastases include reoperations, immunosuppression, radiation therapy, torpid course of the surgical wound with cerebrospinal fluid fistula, and histologic progression. Awareness of these features is advisable for neurosurgeons involved in the care of patients with similar profiles.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.02.041,,Cutaneous meningioma; Meningioma; Scalp meningioma; Skin meningioma; Subcutaneous meningioma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Approximately 45 cases have been reported in the literature concerning nail gun injuries penetrating the cranium. These cases pose a challenge for the neurosurgeon because of the uniqueness of each case, the dynamics of high pressure nail gun injuries, and the surgical planning to remove the foreign body without further vascular injury or uncontrolled intracranial hemorrhage. Here we present four cases of penetrating nail gun injuries with variable presentations. Case 1 is of a 33-year-old white man who sustained 10 nail gunshot injuries to his head. Case 2 is of a 51-year-old white man who sustained bi-temporal nail gun injuries to his head. Cases 3 and 4 are of two white men aged 22 years and 49 years with a single nail gun injury to the head. In the context of these individual cases and a review of similar cases in the literature we present surgical approaches and considerations in the management of nail gun injuries to the cranium. Case 1 presented with cranial nerve deficits, Case 2 required intubation for low Glasgow Coma Scale, while Cases 3 and 4 were neurologically intact on presentation. Three patients underwent angiography for assessment of vascular injury and all patients underwent surgical removal of foreign objects using a vice-grip. No neurological deficits were found in these patients on follow-up. Nail gun injuries can present with variable clinical status; mortality and morbidity is low for surgically managed isolated nail gun-related injuries to the head. The current case series describes the surgical use of a vice-grip for a good grip of the nail head and controlled extraction, and these patients appear to have a good postoperative prognosis with minimal neurological deficits postoperatively and on follow-up.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-016-0839-1,PMC4832548,Brain; Nails; Neurosurgery; Penetrating trauma,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

2521095,The nature and management of aggression in epilepsy.,"Fenwick, P",Fenwick,"Minor episodes of aggressive behavior are relatively common in some populations of patients with epilepsy. However, they are probably no more common than in populations who are socially disadvantaged or who have brain damage. The confusion that commonly follows seizures can lead to apparently aggressive behavior. Rarely, the seizure itself may lead to directed aggression; very rarely does it lead to murderous attacks. Although post-ictal psychotic aggression is usually not severe, when it is driven by prominent delusions and hallucinations, it can result in self-destructive acts or serious violence. Clearly, however, it is quite unfair to globally classify epileptics as aggressive, and the time has come to abandon this stereotype.",{},,The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1176/jnp.1.4.418,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Craniofacial impacts, even of low intensity, received during brawls may be associated with brain lesions ranging from a simple knock-out to fatal injuries. In criminal cases that are brought to court, even by autopsy it is still difficult to establish a direct link between the violence of the impact and the injuries that resulted in death. During a facial impact, the head undergoes a movement of violent forced hyperextension. Death may thus be secondary to the transmission of forces to the brain, either by a mechanism involving nerve conduction that may be termed a reflex mechanism (for example by vagal hyperstimulation) or by injury to the central nervous system (axonal damage). In such situations, autopsy does not make it possible to determine the cause of death, but only to suspect it in a context of voluntary violence in the presence of witnesses, with or without violent injury observed on external examination or on superficial incisions to determine the extent of bruises or hematoma. Systemic and comprehensive investigation involving pathology and toxicology is essential in any medicolegal case for positive interpretation and discrimination of other causes of death.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Morphologie : bulletin de l'Association des anatomistes,10.1016/j.morpho.2021.07.004,,Axonal injury; Brainstem; Forensic sciences; Head trauma; Mandibular impact; Sudden death,Case Reports,France,eng

He subsequently developed quickly generalizing partial complex seizures, associated with severe behavioural alterations and personality changes; the condition was left untreated.

The instituted anti-epileptic treatment reduced seizure frequency and severity, but did not affect psychiatric symptomatology, which even worsened. An association between anti-epileptic drugs with mood stabilizing properties and an atypical anti-psychotic dramatically improved psychiatric symptoms, but did not prevent the patient from needing long-term healthcare.

Additionally, despite advances in other cancers, immunotherapy has been ineffective in this disease thus far and treatment remains centered around cytotoxic chemotherapy. Here, we present a case of a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring both high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and <i>HER2</i> amplification. After an initial response to standard-of-care chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX followed by progression, she was treated with dual immune checkpoint blockade, which resulted in a period of disease control. This was complicated by the development of autoimmune hypophysitis and an incidental finding of brain metastasis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her extracranial disease progressed while receiving stereotactic radiosurgery, with findings of lymphangitic spread in her lungs, and her treatment was changed to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab. This resulted in a degree of extracranial disease control, though she experienced progressive brain metastases despite radiation and therapeutic switch to lapatinib and trastuzumab. Ultimately, the patient developed leptomeningeal disease which was not controlled by intrathecal trastuzumab. Given the rarity of central nervous system metastasis, <i>HER2</i> amplification, and MSI in pancreatic cancer, this patient's presentation represents a confluence of multiple unique features. This case highlights the clinical value of up-front next-generation sequencing in metastatic pancreatic cancer and the ability of pancreatic cancer with actionable molecular variants to develop atypical sites of disease and adaptive resistance.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,AME case reports,10.21037/acr-20-154,PMC8060150,HER2 amplification; Microsatellite instability (MSI); brain metastasis; case report; pancreatic cancer,Case Reports,China,eng

Most cases arise in the major salivary glands, especially the parotid gland. ACC is usually known as a low-grade malignant tumor; however, poorly differentiated and high-grade transformed variants have been reported and may tend to be late recurrence and metastasis. Our case was a 49-year-old woman with a history of a right parotid rapidly growing mass lesion, which was cytologically diagnosed as monomorphic adenoma on fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Finally, the diagnosis of ACC with dedifferentiated components was reported, followed by parotidectomy. After 30 sessions of radiotherapy, she presented with hemifacial paresis. An imaging examination of the brain showed intracranial hemorrhage, and she underwent a craniotomy. We performed histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) examinations and diagnosed metastatic ACC with dedifferentiated components. Few ACC cases with dedifferentiated components and with aggressive behavior have been reported in the literature , and to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first English report in Iranian population.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Iranian journal of pathology,10.30699/IJP.2021.530574.2645,PMC8794557,Acinic Cell Carcinoma; Dedifferentiation; Metastasis; Neoplasm; Salivary gland,Case Reports,Iran,eng

In a few cases, they may present aggressive behavior and invade the sphenoid sinus and nasal cavity, causing unusual symptoms. In this paper, we report an atypical case of pituitary adenoma presenting as a nasal mass. The patient was a 44-year-old woman who had had amenorrhea and galactorrhea for ten months, with associated nasal obstruction, macroglossia and acromegaly. Both growth hormone and prolactin levels were increased. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass originating from the lower surface of the pituitary gland, associated with sella turcica erosion and tumor extension through the sphenoid sinus and nasal cavity. Histopathological analysis demonstrated a chromophobe pituitary adenoma with densely packed rounded epithelial cells, with some atypias and rare mitotic figures. There was no evidence of metastases. Macroadenoma invading the nasal cavity is a rare condition and few similar cases have been reported in the literature. This study contributes towards showing that tumor extension to the sphenoid sinus and nasopharynx needs to be considered and investigated in order to make an early diagnosis when atypical symptoms like nasal obstruction are present.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,10.1590/1516-3180-2014-1326693,PMC10496777,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Brazil,eng

However, prolonged ""infantile-like"" behavior has received little attention in the literature, suggesting that this is a rare phenomenon. It is typically characterized by long-lasting childish, extremely dependent, and sometimes aggressive behavior, which is distinguished from the expected recovery process. The relevant theoretical framework lies in the field of disorders called ""Neuropathologies of the self"" (NPS). We report three cases of young adults who, following a severe TBI, developed continual regressive behavior. The Disability Rating Scale (DRS) was used to assess possible change in their condition. First, while admitted, which was performed in retrospect, and again 6 years later at the time stated. Inter-rater reliability for the scale items showed adequate correlation. Results showed no significant difference in patients' scores, indicating persistent functional difficulties. We conclude that this ""regressive syndrome"" presents an unusual form of behavior that is stable over time. It seems to be in line with other NPS disorders, and may stem from an interaction of organic factors and primary mental complexity. Nevertheless, further research is required to examine the factors affecting the emergence and recovery from this phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.826680,,Neuropathologies of the self; Personality change; Pre-morbid personality; Regressive states; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The use of such products remains popular among American youth as a whole, but is especially high among active duty service members. Supplements are minimally regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and unlike pharmaceuticals, supplements are often brought to market without any testing to show neither efficacy nor safety. Several case reports have documented serious adverse events and raise the question of whether supplement use was a causative factor. Reported events occurring after use of pre-workout supplements include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, hepatitis, and death. Here, we present the case of a healthy 25-year-old active duty male who experienced a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhagic stroke occurring shortly after taking a supplement named Animal Rage XL. Hemorrhagic stroke occurring in a healthy 25-year-old male with no risk factors is exceedingly rare. This is the first known case of stroke temporally associated with this particular supplement, which is currently available for purchase at military exchanges. Additionally, several of the active ingredients in this supplement have been shown to cause hypertension, tachycardia, and vasospasm. All of these effects could increase the likelihood and severity of a hemorrhagic stroke.

As in the eponymous Shakespearean tragedy, there is an unfortunate risk of violence. For patients with these symptoms, consultation-liaison psychiatrists may be asked to assist with evaluating the differential diagnosis, assessing safety, and developing treatment options. This study's objective was to solidify current knowledge of the clinical presentations and management of OS through a systematic review of the literature and description of 2 new cases. We conducted a literature search from the start of relevant databases through August 2023 to identify English language case reports of adults (≥18 years) with OS that described clinical evaluations, biological treatments, and outcomes. We extracted demographics, proposed etiologies, treatment choices and responses, duration of delusions, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, neuro-radiographic findings, and presence of physical violence. We reported clinical findings for 2 new cases. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we screened 705 abstracts and conducted full-text reviews of 118 articles to identify 73 cases published from 1983 to 2023 meeting inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58.2 years with male predominance (M:F = 1.88). Etiologies included primary psychiatric disorders (16, 22%), other medical conditions (38, 52%), and medications or other substances (19, 26%). Delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, and dopaminergic agonists were the most common etiologies, respectively, in these groups. Antipsychotics were the most common treatment (57, 78%). Symptom remission was reported in 51 (70%) cases. The average duration of OS was 39.5 months. Of 32 cases reporting brain imaging insults, 12 of 20 (60%) showed right-sided lesions, and 8 of 20 (40%) showed left-sided lesions, with 9 of 32 (28%) located in the frontal lobes. The most commonly co-existing psychiatric symptom was depression (14, 19%). Violence was reported in 25 cases (34%). Our 2 new cases were consistent with these findings. OS may be a manifestation of several neuropsychiatric conditions, primarily delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's dementia, and the use of dopaminergic agonists. One-third of cases include violent behaviors. It appears to respond to antipsychotic medications, but treatment is delayed more than 3 years on average.

Such a drainage pattern is associated with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and progressive focal neurological deficits. Patients with cranial dural AVF's often undergo surgical excision and/or endovascular embolization for elimination of the AVF. Since these lesions are frequently large and involve the skull base or adjacent dural sinuses, extensive surgery is often required. In contrast, spinal dural AVF's with only intradural venous drainage to the medullary venous system are treated successfully by simply interrupting the vein that drains the dural AVF as it enters the subarachnoid space. The authors identified a subgroup of patients with cranial dural AVF's in whom the AVF was drained only by leptomeningeal veins, and sought to establish whether simple interruption of the vein draining the blood from the AVF into the subarachnoid space is effective and lasting treatment in this subgroup of patients, as it is in patients with spinal dural AVF's. Four adult patients with symptomatic cranial dural AVF's (two petrotentorial, one middle fossa floor, and one posterior fossa base) were identified on arteriography as having fistulae that were supplied by the internal and/or external carotid arteries and drained only via leptomeningeal veins (two entered the petrosal vein, one a cerebellar hemispheric vein, and one a mesencephalic vein). All patients underwent interruption of the vein draining the dural AVF as it penetrated the dura to enter the subarachnoid space, and experienced neurological improvement after surgery. Repeat arteriography at 1 to 2 weeks (three patients), 3 months (3 patients), 12 to 15 months (three patients), and 4 years (two patients) revealed no residual AVF and no evidence of abnormal blood flow. Many cranial dural AVF's with leptomeningeal venous drainage (the type with the most aggressive behavior) are drained only by leptomeningeal veins. This subgroup of patients can be identified by selective arteriography and requires only interruption of the draining vein as it enters the subarachnoid space for successful, lasting elimination.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.1994.80.4.0617,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

During its short course in the neck, the carotid artery travels encased in the carotid sheath along with the vagus nerve and the internal jugular vein. During its course in the neck, the carotid artery is quite superficial, making it vulnerable to both penetrating and blunt traumatic injuries. We report here a case of a 40-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after sudden collapse and loss of consciousness a day after an attempted strangulation. Imaging revealed large hemorrhagic infarcts in the left anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territories as well as a smaller infarcts in the right anterior cerebral artery territory necessitating emergency decompressive hemicraniectomy.

Chordoid meningioma is an uncommon variant of meningioma and corresponds to grade II tumor in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Nervous System 2007 because of its more aggressive behavior and increased likelihood of recurrence. A 75-year-old female was referred to the neurosurgery department complaining of headache, syncope, and seizure. Radiological examination revealed a mass lesion in the neighbourhood of the frontal lobe that destructed bone and was associated with peritumoral edema. The patient underwent surgery. The tumor was totally excised with the dura beneath. Histopathological examination showed that the tumor was composed of clusters and cords of small polygonal cells with fine chromatin and eosinophilic vacuolated cytoplasm embedded in a myxoid matrix, and also focal whorls of spindle-shaped cells. Two mitoses were seen in 10 high power fields. Vascular proliferation was observed in some tumoral areas. Bone invasion was present. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells revealed widespread strong membranous and cytoplasmic expression of epithelial membrane antigen. The Ki67 labeling index was 6-8%. All of these findings were consistent with a diagnosis of chordoid meningioma, the neoplasm was identified as grade II based on the World Health Organization Classification, 2007.

Although several prior case studies have described outcome following acute onset of HSVE, this case presents a unique challenge for rehabilitation in several respects. First, EB's pre-morbid history is complicated; in contrast with prior HSVE case studies that have typically involved individuals with a relatively high level of pre-morbid functioning, EB presents with limited educational attainment and a prior history of several incarcerations for violent offenses. Post-injury, his presentation includes significant verbal aggression, threats of harm toward others, physical posturing and occasional physical aggression toward his caretakers. Third, EB presents with a fixed delusion that others are constantly taking advantage of him. These features are present in the context of global amnesia and relatively intact cognitive functioning in other domains. Following a brief review of prior HSVE case studies, this study reviews the outcomes of various pharmacological, cognitive, behavioural and integrative interventions designed for management of EB's aggression and agitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2014.954623,,Aggression; amnesia; encephalitis; neuropsychological; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

36081625,Case report: Fluctuating tumor markers in a boy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone-independent precocious puberty induced by a pineal germ cell tumor.,"Cattoni, Alessandro; Albanese, Assunta",Cattoni,"GnRH-independent precocious puberty (GIPP) can be the presenting clinical picture experienced by patients with secreting germ cell tumor (GCT). Indeed, as luteinizing hormone (LH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) share identical α-subunits and similar β-subunits, an increased secretion of β-hCG may result in a precocious activation of Leydig cells. Though the co-occurrence of raised β-hCG levels and signs of precocious virilization usually prompts a complete oncological work-up, the diagnostic and therapeutic management of GCT-induced GIPP may be challenging. We report the case of a 6.2 year-old boy presenting with clinical and biochemical findings consistent with GIPP (discrepancy between overt virilization and pre-pubertal testicular volume, suppressed gonadotropins and remarkably raised testosterone). Brain imaging detected a bilobed cyst of the pineal gland, while serum and cerebrospinal baseline assessment initially ruled out raised alpha-fetoprotein or β-hCG levels. Nevertheless, a strict biochemical follow-up highlighted a fluctuant trend of tumor markers, with a more aggressive behavior and recurrent erections occurring as a result of unpredictable phases of raised testosterone and serum/cerebrospinal β-hCG, followed by sudden spontaneous decrease. Accordingly, a secreting pineal GCT was suspected. Given the fluctuating trend of tumor markers, surgery was initially kept on hold and a combined treatment with bicalutamide (androgen receptor blocker) and anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor) was undertaken in order to prevent the patient from experiencing further virilization and excessive bone age maturation. Subsequently, a progression in the size of the pineal tumor prompted surgical resection and a diagnosis of secreting GCT was histologically confirmed. Accordingly, the patient was started on adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy. Antineoplastic treatment was followed by persistent and remarkable decrease of tumor markers and by a complete pubertal arrest. We reported the challenging diagnosis of a secreting pineal GCT in a patient with GIPP and a fluctuating trend of tumor markers, testosterone levels and associated clinical signs, hence prompting the indication for a systematic assessment and a strict monitoring whenever a patient with GnRH-independent precocious puberty shows clinical or radiological markers potentially consistent with a GCT.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in pediatrics,10.3389/fped.2022.940656,PMC9445167,anastrozole; aromatase inhibitors; bicalutamide; chorionic gonadotropin; germ cell and embryonal neoplasms; pineal cyst; precocious puberty,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We report on a patient showing behavior changes and degeneration of core neural tracts for emotional regulation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 51-year-old male patient suffered an in-car accident. The patient lost consciousness for approximately 30 days, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3. He underwent stereotactic drainage for traumatic intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhages. At approximately 6.5-year after onset, he began to show disinhibition behaviors such as shouting with anger, which worsened over time. At approximately 8-year after onset, he showed severe depression signs and disinhibition, including violence. The patient who showed delayed-onset behavioral changes (disinhibition and depression). Diffusion tensor imaging data were acquired at 3 months and 8 years after TBI onset. The patient showed degeneration of core neural tracts for emotional regulation that was associated with delayed behavioral changes following TBI.

Secondly, the rehabilitation environment in which treatment was conducted did not comprise a highly specialized neurobehavioural service, Instead, staff were specifically trained regarding the administration of the treatment programme, which was based on principles derived from behaviour modification and applied neuropsychology. Specific interventions used included those of differential reinforcement and graduated increase of expectations. Recordings made over the course of 85 weeks demonstrate a significant decrease in the frequency and severity of aggression.

21866405,Chordoma of the thoracic spine in an 89-year-old.,"Fontes, Ricardo; O'Toole, John E",Fontes,"Case report and literature review. Report the highly unusual presentation of thoracic spine chordoma in an 89-year-old and review existing literature as it impacts treatment in the elderly. Chordomas are infrequent tumors of the spine that commonly present during mid-adulthood at the spheno-occipital or sacrococcygeal junctions. The mobile spine is affected in 10-15% of cases but chordomas are extremely rare in the thoracic spine. Chordoma rarely enters the differential diagnosis of spinal tumors in elderly patients, for whom metastases and multiple myeloma are by far the most common. A case report is detailed of an 89-year-old male presenting with incapacitating pain and early signs of thoracic myelopathy. A lytic, expanding lesion of the T10 vertebral body with epidural spinal cord compression was identified. In the absence of evidence of other primary tumor, a CT-guided needle biopsy revealed chordoma. A literature review of reported thoracic spine chordomas was also performed. An intralesional posterolateral resection and reconstruction was performed with good results and no recurrence at 13 months' follow-up. 30 reports of thoracic spine chordomas were identified in the literature since 1902. Mean age of presentation at 35.7 years is earlier than for most chordomas. The oldest previously reported patient was 68-year-old. Neurological impairment at presentation is rare with the usual presenting symptom being pain. Response to radiation and chemotherapy is limited. 5-year survival rates range from 50 to 60%. Chordoma is a highly uncommon epidural neoplasm of the thoracic spine and is vanishingly rare in elderly patients.

Their surgical management is complicated and challenging. Herein, we present the case of a 30-years-old man who was a victim of aggression from a rake blow to the head. The rake's teeth were embedded in his cranium, crossing the midline. The surgery was delicate and had to be well studied because two of the rake's teeth plunged into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The patient recovered a perfect state of consciousness and was discharged with squealer right upper limb monoparesia. Penetrating intracranial foreign bodies are rare. Few studies have reported on the removal of such foreign bodies, particularly in cases where the foreign body is close to or penetrates the SSS. They cause spectacular cranial trauma and a greater volume of the object. The aim of surgery is to remove the object without worsening the parenchymal and vascular cerebral lesions. This maneuver was delicate. A craniectomy is recommended around the penetrating object before it is carefully extracted with or without opening the dura mater.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Korean journal of neurotrauma,10.13004/kjnt.2023.19.e8,PMC10083454,Foreign bodies; Nervous system; Trauma,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

MRI images revealed a large left orbital mass with optic nerve involvement and extension to the left maxillary sinus, pterygoid fossa and the dura in the floor of the anterior fossa. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass confirmed tumor recurrence. The patient first received radiotherapy due to the inoperable mass, and the tumor was resected 1.5 month later. Microscopic study showed meningotheliomatous meningioma with extensive involvement of the optic nerve and invasion of the optic disc, sclera and choroid. The interesting aspect of this case was the aggressive behavior of the tumor with intraocular invasion, despite its benign histopathological features, which led to wide exenteration of the eye together with resection of the upper and lower lids.",{},,"Orbit (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",10.1080/01676830601168835,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe the sequential development of Cushing's disease, apoplexy and aggressive pituitary tumor in the same patient. A 31-year old male presented with eutopic ACTH dependent Cushing's syndrome which failed initial pituitary surgery. He underwent subsequent bilateral adrenalectomy for control of hypercortisolism. An episode of pituitary apoplexy then occurred which was followed by the development of a null-cell pituitary tumor. This second tumor exhibited an aggressive behavior with invasion into the surrounding structures and systemic spread clinically. This case provides important evidence for the hypotheses of the pathogenesis of aggressive pituitary tumors which could have arisen from surviving adenoma cells following apoplexy or as a de novo development of pituitary carcinoma from cells which were not part of the original adenoma.

It is considered a subtype of non-seminoma germ cell tumor (NSGCT) that is presumed to have an aggressive behavior with high malignant potential, thus requiring multimodality treatment with resection and chemotherapy. Treatment is curative for the majority of patients, even the ones with relapse after a few years. Here, we describe for the first time an atypical case of YST recurrence 17 years after primary treatment of YST. This is a case of YST in a 32-year-old man who presented with a large cerebellar mass consistent with YST recurrence after being in remission for 17 years. He underwent suboccipital craniotomy and complete excision of the tumor, as evident on postoperative MRI with a plan for stereotactic radiosurgery with dose and fractionation determined by MRI at four weeks postoperatively. However, the four-week MRI postoperatively revealed a large mass that was engulfing the prior resection cavity, indicative of unusual rapid tumor recurrence despite evidence of complete resection. The highly aggressive nature of this tumor should prompt clinicians to consider chemotherapy and radiation earlier than four weeks postoperatively.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.17143,PMC8437004,brain and lung metastasis; conus medullaris; late testicular yolk sac tumor relapse; non-seminoma germ cell tumor; suboccipital craniotomy; uncommon metastasis,Case Reports,United States,eng

A 26-year-old man presenting with headache and visual field impairment was found to have a supratentorial mass mimicking meningioma. Craniotomy was performed for tumor resection, and postoperative histologic examination revealed atypical cells that were nonenlarged lymphocytes with irregularly shaped and enlarged nuclei; these cells were cluster of differentiation 30 and ALK-positive, leading to the diagnosis of a small cell variant of ALK-positive ALCL. In this case, the tumor exhibited an aggressive behavior with MTX resistance with metastases in the pelvis but responded well to cytarabine and etoposide (CYVE). In general, CNS ALK-positive ALCL responds well to MTX, but small cell variants show aggressive behavior and may be resistant to MTX.

The authors present two case reports of patients who developed the new onset of kleptomania after closed head trauma. Both patients had comorbid psychiatric symptoms associated with the kleptomania. Antidepressant monotherapy was not beneficial in reducing kleptomania in either patient. Kleptomanic behavior was successfully treated in both patients, however, through combination treatment using an antidepressant agent together with adjunctive cognitive behavioral therapy or adjunctive naltrexone. In one patient, single photon emission tomography showed a perfusion deficit in the left temporal lobe. Various hypotheses regarding this finding and the etiopathology of kleptomania are discussed.

It is often difficult for the patient to reconcile with their post-injury persona, and the memory of pre-injury personhood is particularly painful. Insight into one's cognitive deficits subsequent to injury can lead to an existential crisis and a sense of loss, including loss of self. Restoration of cognitive functions and reconciliation with loss of pre-traumatic personhood employing a holistic method of neuropsychological rehabilitation in a patient suffering from TBI. Ms. K.S, a 25-year-old female, presented with emotional disturbances following TBI. She reported both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. A multidimensional holistic rehabilitation was planned. Treatment addressed cognitive deficits through the basic functions approach. Cognitive behavioural methods for emotional regulation like diary writing helped reduce irritability and anger outbursts. Use of social media created new modes of memory activation and interactions. Compensatory strategies were used to recover lost skills, music-based attention training helped foster an individualised approach to the sense of one's body and self. As a result of these differing strategies, changes were reflected in neuro-psychological tests, depression score and the patient's self-evaluation. This helped generate a coherent self-narrative. Treatment challenges in such cases are increased due to patient's actual deficits caused by neuronal/biochemical changes. Innovative and multi-pronged rehabilitation strategies which involve everyday activities provided an answer to some of these problems. This method of rehabilitation may provide an optimistic context for future research.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-208017,PMC7613148,Traumatic brain injury; autobiographical memories; cognitive rehabilitation; holistic rehabilitation; music-based intervention; selfhood,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Intracranial meningiomas with heterogenous histopathology in the same lesion are common in low-grade meningiomas but less frequent in recurrent and high-grade variants. A 75-year-old male presented elsewhere a year ago with complaints of slurred speech. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left frontotemporal, dural-based, extraaxial, solid cystic lesion with doubtful infiltration into the adjacent brain parenchyma. A subtotal excision was done. A diagnosis of meningioma with an aggressive biological behavior was rendered on histology, but the grade was deferred, in view of a single focus of small cell formation and no adjacent brain parenchyma to comment on invasion. The patient presented here with recurrence of his original symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast revealed 2 dural-based, solid cystic enhancing lesions of sizes 29 mm × 25 mm × 24 mm and 25 mm × 16 mm seen at the left frontal region, indenting the adjacent brain parenchyma with diffuse meningeal thickening in the postoperative bed. Microscopy revealed a hypercellular meningeal neoplasm with increased mitosis and a pseudopapillary pattern with lipomatous changes. To date there are no case reports in current literature with such rare combinations in a recurrent meningioma. This highlights the multipotency of phenotypic transformation of primary meningothelial cells. The presence of papillary features, even if focal, should be quantified in the diagnosis. This is of importance because the most current literature suggests that meningioma harboring a papillary component has an increased risk of recurrence and progression to aggressive behavior.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.09.151,,Atypical; Elderly male; Lipomatous; Meningioma; Papillary; Recurrence,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

His family reported that the patient demonstrated increased irritability and aggressive behavior. A computed tomographic scan revealed a large mass of the left frontal convexity with edema and mass effect. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed a 5-cm homogeneously enhancing mass in the left posterior frontal lobe. Preoperatively, the patient underwent angiography and embolization of the tumor. The patient underwent gross total resection of tumor. The dural-based tumor invaded the cranium and scalp. Neuropathological findings were consistent with low-grade follicular lymphoma. The patient is currently undergoing radiation and chemotherapy. The current case represents the first report of extensive intracranial dural involvement by a follicular lymphoma that shows a classic immunophenotype by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The case illustrates the clinical and radiographic similarities between dural-based lymphoma and meningioma.

Its accuracy is quantitatively assessed using a publicly available gold standard. A patient case is used to illustrate the technique's clinical usefulness in image-guided neurosurgery. Before and after functional MRI (fMRI) acquisition, additional anatomical images were acquired at spatial locations identical to those of the functional images (5-10 slices) for the purpose of voxel-based image registration. Registration accuracy of the anatomical volumes and high-resolution 3D MRI volumes (MP-RAGE imaging) was quantified using adapted data (8 patients) originating from the Vanderbilt Retrospective Registration Evaluation Project (NIH project 1 R01 NS33926-02). Selecting three subsets of slices from that data (5 slices/6 mm slice distance, 10 slices/3 mm distance, and 10 slices/6 mm distance), the small number of images available from fMRI acquisition was taken into account. Accuracies in registering these sparse data sets were then compared to the accuracy achieved using complete data. For clinical patient data (16 patients), fMRI images were fused with MP-RAGE images, thereby integrating anatomical images with information about the locations of functional areas. The resulting images were used for planning and navigation during tumor resections using an operating microscope (MKM, Zeiss). Quantitative analysis showed no loss of registration accuracy due to a reduced number of slices, regardless of whether 5 or 10 slices were used. For small-volume coverage in the anatomical images (thickness 24 mm), registration of one patient failed, and this could easily be identified by visual inspection. No failures were experienced when 54 mm was covered. In the clinical environment, all 16 interventions using fused fMRI and MRI data were successful.

Dysphagia is the typical clinical complaint, although it is present only when most of the lumen is obstructed. Therefore, quite often, the metastatic disease is first diagnosed, which contributes to the patient's poor survival expectancy. The authors report the case of a 58-year-old man who looked for medical care complaining of a long-term history of scapular pain. The diagnostic work-up disclosed a cervical spine lytic lesion surrounded by a tumoral mass shown by computed tomography. The cervical tumor was sampled by fine needle aspiration, revealing an undifferentiated carcinoma. The outcome was unfavorable and the patient died. The autopsy findings revealed metastatic disease to the spine and central nervous system, and the primary tumor was found to be an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which had progressed without typical dysphagia.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Autopsy & case reports,10.4322/acr.2014.047,PMC4608171,"Brain; Carcinoma, Squamous Cells; Esophageal Neoplasm; Neoplasm Metastasis; Spine",Case Reports,Brazil,eng

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is usually associated with several tumors, including gastric cancer, but only a few cases have been reported in patients with AFPGC. This report describes a case of advanced-stage AFPGC associated with DIC in a 50-year-old White man. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old, White, non-smoker man was hospitalized for a recent left hemiparesis associated with anorexia and loss of weigh. Clinically, we had multiple, hard, irregular, subcutaneous nodules, left supraclavicular lymph nodes, and a left, complete hemiparesis. Laboratory tests showed a DIC. A whole-body CT scan documented multiple lymph node, liver, subcutaneous, bone, and muscular metastases, a right femoral venous thrombosis, a left popliteal arterial thrombosis, and splenic and renal infarcts. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of a subcutaneous lesion. Histology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasis from a high-grade AFPGC. Before starting any systemic treatment, the patient presented a massive intraventricular brain hemorrhage, quickly leading to his death.

23071466,Optic nerve sheath meningioma in the first decade of life: case report and review of the literature.,"Monteiro, Mário L R; Gonçalves, Allan Christian P; Siqueira, Sheila Aparecida C; Gebrim, Eloísa M M",Monteiro,"Tumors of the optic nerve are mostly either optic nerve gliomas or optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSMs). While gliomas occur in children, most meningiomas are slow-growing tumors affecting middle-aged individuals with progressive visual loss, proptosis, disc edema and optociliary veins on fundus examination. ONSMs are extremely rare in children, with only 14 cases reported in children under the age of 10 years. The purpose of this study is to describe an additional case and review clinical, radiologic and histopathological findings that can help differentiate such tumors in children and allow an early and accurate diagnosis. An 8-year-old girl had a 2-year history of progressive proptosis and total visual loss on the right side. A computed tomography scan revealed a well-defined intraconal mass with perioptic calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor surrounding the optic nerve and extending intracranially, with enhancement following gadolinium injection. The patient was submitted to fronto-orbital craniotomy for complete tumor excision. Histological studies identified the neoplasm as ONSM. Though unusual, ONSMs may occur in children and, in these cases, present a much more aggressive behavior than in adults. ONSM should therefore be differentiated from optic glioma in children because of its aggressive behavior and need for different treatment modalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Case reports in ophthalmology,10.1159/000342261,PMC3457045,Benign optic nerve sheath neoplasm; Meningioma; Optic nerve neoplasms,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

SCM is optimal when attempting to meet highly individual presentations or to trial innovative solutions. Portable biofeedback is a potentially effective means of helping persons with brain injury to recognise and regulate emotional states. Emotional dysregulation, associated with disinhibition on tests of executive function, is hypothesised to underpin aggressive challenging behaviour and may be amenable to feedback on heart rate variability, a marker for stress. Two case studies of a novel biofeedback intervention, emWave2, to address aggression directed towards the self and towards others are presented. Data from two A-B designs were analysed using the non-overlap all pairs (NAP) statistical method. Clinical significance of outcome is reported in both cases but only Case 2 reached statistical significance. The discussion highlights limitations of the methodology. Results are discussed in relation to the device helping participants differentiate the physiological state associated with stress.

These symptoms were then followed by hyperactivity, bouts of anger, and difficulty sleeping. The patient was seen by a psychiatrist, and he was diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) initially and treated with little to no improvement. He was then recommended to see a neurologist by his psychiatrist and underwent a series of investigations, which included the following: brain MRI with contrast, magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) routine, CSF N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody analysis, and a CSF meningitis multiplex polymerase chain reaction, thyroid function, ammonia, lactate, creatine kinase, liver function, and metabolic screening of urine organic acids (UOAs), all of which revealed no abnormalities. Vitamin D was low at 38 ng/ml (>50). An electroencephalogram (EEG) done under standard conditions and provocative stimulation was abnormal with bilateral central and frontal discharge and more activity on the right side, revealing a background activity of moderately organized alpha waves (8-13 Hz) and bursts of sharp and slow wave activities that were accentuated by photic stimulation. Polysomnography showed poor sleep efficiency of 84.7%, and rapid eye movement (REM) stage was not reached due to interrupted sleep. He was then diagnosed with epileptic encephalopathy and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). The patient was prescribed sodium valproate, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and pulse steroids, with no major improvement, risperidone was added but was poorly tolerated, and the dose tapered off and eventually discontinued. Methylphenidate was the prescribed starting at 5 mg, and the dose was gradually increased to 20 mg/day given separately as 10 mg twice a day. A week later, melatonin 2 mg was added. Three months, later the EEG was repeated and was normal, and sodium valproate was tapered off and eventually discontinued. Later on that year, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and developed acute myositis as a complication, methylphenidate was stopped, and only sertraline and melatonin were continued. MRI was repeated only this time, showing evidence of viral/autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) sequela, and IV corticosteroids were given alongside IVIG.

The psychopharmacological treatment of patients with acquired brain injury frequently includes numerous trials of psychotherapeutic drugs such as antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and lithium, in an effort towards affective and behavioural improvement. In this report we describe and graphically depict the striking efficacy of valproic acid in reducing and improving destructive and aggressive behaviours in five patients with acquired brain injury. In all cases valproic acid was effective after other pharmacological interventions were not. Also, the addition of valproic acid was followed by neurobehavioural improvement rather quickly, often within 1-2 weeks. Advantages of valproic acid, in addition to its possible unique efficacy, include a lower propensity towards sedation and cognitive impairment, and thus a more robust potential for rehabilitation participation. Behaviours associated with affective disorders ranging along the affective spectrum from depression to dysphoric mania may be particularly amenable to valproic acid.

An artificially low natural baseline resulted from staff reluctance to deliver instructions and corrective feedback needed for rehabilitation of self-care skill because these were frequently followed by aggression. A subsequent structured baseline presented these antecedents at the higher rates that were necessary for progress in the patient's rehabilitation. This resulted in an increase in aggressive behaviour, but also gave a more accurate representation of what his behaviour would be like under effective rehabilitation conditions. Intervention was based on data from the structured baseline, and included providing clear expectations, social reinforcement, and decelerative procedures. After reduction of aggression to zero, regular staff were reintroduced and presented instruction and corrective feedback as required. No further aggressive behaviour was noted, and self-care improved so that only minimal assistance was needed. Six months following reintroduction of regular staff, both baseline conditions were replicated. No aggressive behaviour was observed during either, suggesting that maintenance of gains could not be attributed to an artificially reduced rate caused by staff avoiding trigger antecedents.",{},,Brain injury,10.3109/02699059409151011,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,England,eng

Since patients with other personality disorders also exhibit impulsive aggressive behavior, we conducted a preliminary open-label trial of divalproex sodium as a treatment for irritability and aggression in patients with a variety of personality disorders. Ten patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for at least one personality disorder were treated with divalproex sodium in an 8-week open clinical trial. All patients had failed a trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Divalproex sodium was increased as tolerated using a flexible dosing schedule. Clinician ratings for impulsive aggressive behavior and irritability were made every 2 weeks using the modified Overt Aggression Scale (OAS-M). Six of 8 completers reported significant decreases in irritability (p = .003) and impulsive aggressive behavior (p = .019). For the entire sample, improvement on OAS-M irritability and overt aggression scores was noted by the end of 4 weeks and continued to occur through week 8. This study suggests that divalproex sodium is an effective treatment for impulsive aggressive behavior in some patients with personality disorder who fail to respond to other antiaggressive agents (i.e., SSRIs).

Upon examination we later diagnosed him with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome based on clinical and radiological findings that are characteristic for this rare autosomal dominant syndrome. His psychiatric manifestations included irritability, aggressive behavior, labile mood, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and transient cognitive impairment. His past history indicated surgical excision of pigmented lesion in the left lower eyelid which turned out to be a basal cell carcinoma. His past visits to dermatology clinics indicated pitted keratosis involving hands, callosities, and seborrheic dermatitis. There were numerous palmar pits, and Brain CT Head scan revealed extensive calcification along falx cerebri and around the cerebellar vermis. He had low (20 ng/L) vitamin D level and high parathyroid hormone level.

Recognizing the particular form of catastrophic reaction is important both to determine proper behavioral management and to help patients accept the effects of the brain injury. Applying Kohutian theory and self psychology constructs, the authors present several case studies to show how the patients shared the same underlying experience of shame and anxiety over their injury-related impairments. These patients participated in an outpatient, milieu-oriented rehabilitation program intended to increase their independence at home and to facilitate their return to productive work. The rehabilitation therapist's role was to help patients move from a state of being unable to accept their deficits to one of setting and pursuing attainable goals.

Using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), we report on a patient with severe disinhibition and injuries of the amygdala, OFC, and ACC following TBI. A 27-year-old male patient suffered an in-car accident. Since the onset of the TBI, the patient showed severe disinhibition including violence, as follows: 1) he sometimes attacked therapists and nurses with no provocation, 2) while he was laying on a bed, he shouted and kicked the bed when asked questions, and 3) during therapy with a difficult task, he behaved violently to a therapist. The subscale of disinhibition in Neuropsychiatric Inventory scored three points for severity and for distress. N/A. On 10-month DTT, the connectivity of amygdala to the prefrontal cortex including the medial prefrontal cortex and OFC had decreased in both hemispheres. In the prefronto-thalamic tracts, the orbitofronto-thalamic tractshad narrowed (the right hemisphere), and were non-reconstructed (the left hemisphere). Discontinuations of both anterior cingulums were observed in both hemispheres. Using DTT, concurrent injuries of the amygdala, OFC, and ACC were demonstrated in a patient with severe disinhibition following TBI.

The importance of a multidisciplinary approach: a case report.,"Puentes, Katerina; Ribeiro, Cristina; Jardim, Patrícia; Santos, Agostinho; Magalhães, Teresa",Puentes,"According to Portuguese law, if a case of intimate partner violence is noticed or suspected by a professional working in public services, reporting it to the police, medico-legal services or directly to the public prosecutor is mandatory. However, in most cases, reporting does not take place, despite its vital importance in triggering the multidisciplinary intervention that will ensure the correct and timely diagnosis and protection of the victim. In the present case, the victim, a 37 year-old woman, was sexually and physically abused by her husband in their home, and was physically abused again at the victim's mother's house. The victim mentioned that her husband struck her in the head with a hammer and shot a handgun while in her mother's house. However, she denied having a gunshot wound. The couple's daughter was also slapped in the face by her father. The police took the victim to the emergency room of a central hospital to receive medical attention, while the medical examiner on duty was called to the same emergency room to perform a medico-legal evaluation in the context of the intimate partner violence reported to the police. Medico-legal assessment revealed scalp injuries that had not been detected during the first inspection by the emergency room attending physicians who had performed a neurological examination, which revealed no neurological dysfunction. A cranial computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstitution and virtual dissection, requested by the medical examiner, revealed two projectiles trapped in between the inner and the outer table of the cranium, with linear fractures only in the inner table and no brain injuries. Gynecological examination with the collection of biological evidence, also performed by the medical examiner, made it possible to identify a male DNA profile matching her husband's. The victim was subjected to neurosurgery and a follow-up, and was released one month after the traumatic event. A forensic psychological evaluation, performed one month after the traumatic event, revealed the presence of reactive symptoms to the occurrence. This multidisciplinary intervention and the use of modern diagnosis imaging techniques allowed for a timely diagnosis and treatment, adequate protection of the victim and her family, as well as the identification of the aggressor, who was arrested.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,10.1016/j.jflm.2011.04.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

1622325,Anger management training for brain injured patients and their family members.,"Uomoto, J M; Brockway, J A",Uomoto,"Anger dyscontrol is a common occurrence after brain injury. The anger problems of brain injured persons create a burden for their caretakers who most frequently are their family members. Two single-case design studies are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of behavioral interventions for the control of anger problems in brain injured adults. Anger control was accomplished by training the patients in skills to control their own anger, and teaching family members behavior modification principles. In each case, the patient was taught to implement a self-talk method to decrease tension during the escalation period of an anger episode and to execute a time-out when aware of increased anger. Family members were trained in ways to monitor such problems and to identify antecedents to an outburst. They were given feedback and suggestions to modify their communication style with the patient so as to reduce patient irritability, and were taught ways to use a verbal cue to remind the patient to use pretrained self-control methods. Patients and family members were also asked to increase the number of pleasant events in which they engaged as a general means to decrease the patients' anger outbursts. These cases showed evidence that the treatment program reduced the frequency of anger outbursts and, in one case, increased the social participation by the patient immediately after treatment and at one-month and three-month follow-up assessments.

Nonetheless, they rarely penetrate the optic pathway completely. To our knowledge, no previous reports have dealt with the complete penetration of the optic chiasm by unruptured aneurysms of the ophthalmic segment. A 70-year-old woman presented with visual dysfunction in her left eye that she had experienced for several months. Her left visual acuity had rapidly deteriorated to the level of finger counting and visual field testing demonstrated nasal hemianopsia in the left eye and upper temporal quadrant hemianopsia in the right eye. Left internal carotid angiograms and three-dimensional digital subtraction angiograms showed an aneurysm of the ophthalmic segment projecting superomedially. Intraoperative findings revealed complete penetration of the optic chiasm by the fundus of the aneurysm. The optic pathway adjacent to the dome had become remarkably thin and dark yellow. After clipping was completed, the fundus of the aneurysm was punctured to decompress the optic chiasm. Postoperatively, patient's visual acuity in the left eye gradually recovered, but the visual field deficit persisted after the operation. This rare case demonstrates the potentially aggressive behavior of unruptured aneurysms of the ophthalmic segment.

Because the drastic change of the tumor was observed after omental flap transposition, we investigated the effect of the omentum on tumor cells and performed histopathological analyses of meningiomas using a mouse model. We found that meningioma cells have a high affinity to the omentum and show a growth advantage when co-cultured with adipocytes. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that meningioma cells adjacent to the omentum strongly expressed fatty acid-binding protein 4, a lipid transfer protein, in both mouse and human. Our results suggest that tumor cells can receive lipid supply from omental adipocytes, and the surrounding tissues may induce tumor progression. We conclude that although omental tissue is an ideal material for reconstruction surgery, close follow-up is recommended in meningioma patients when used for cranioplasty.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Brain tumor pathology,10.1007/s10014-014-0190-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Japan,eng

Nine of the 14 patients operated on remained seizure-free over the 20-30-year period of follow-up. Between 6 months and one year following temporal lobectomy, two women, previously healthy from a psychiatric standpoint, developed psychoses, and the previous psychiatric problems of four other patients worsened. Two patients, one with incapacitating paranoid personality disorder and the other with explosive rage attacks preoperatively, had marked improvement in their psychiatric status following temporal lobectomy. The remaining six patients, all psychiatrically healthy prior to surgery, have had no change in psychiatric status following surgery. Development of psychosis or deterioration in psychiatric status after surgery was more common in patients with later age of onset, unreality or déjà vu rather than epigastric aura, pre-operative evidence of bilateral brain damage, and persistence of EEG or clinical seizure activity. Development of a chronic psychosis in psychiatrically healthy individuals many months after temporal lobectomy, even when seizures are arrested or ameliorated, suggests that anomalous synaptic regeneration may follow the surgery in these cases. Careful analysis of histories and outcomes may contribute to better understanding of the pathophysiology and anatomical substrates of psychoses.",{},,Psychological medicine,10.1017/s0033291700017049,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the 3rd month, despite significant hippocampal structural damage on imaging, only a milder degree of retrograde and anterograde amnesia persisted on detailed neuropsychological examination. On systematic testing of recognition of facial and vocal expression of emotion, we found an impairment of the vocal perception of fear, but not that of other emotions, such as joy, sadness and anger. Such selective impairment of fear perception was not present in the recognition of facial expression of emotion. Thus emotional perception varies according to the different aspects of emotions and the different modality of presentation (faces versus voices). This is consistent with the idea that there may be multiple emotion systems. The study of emotional perception in this unique case of bilateral involvement of hippocampus suggests that this structure may play a critical role in the recognition of fear in vocal expression, possibly dissociated from that of other emotions and from that of fear in facial expression. In regard of recent data suggesting that the amygdala is playing a role in the recognition of fear in the auditory as well as in the visual modality this could suggest that the hippocampus may be part of the auditory pathway of fear recognition.",{},,European neurology,10.1159/000113394,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

An interim unit based on the principles of neurobehavioural rehabilitation was opened in the grounds of Lidcombe Hospital, and in January 1995 the first patient (SA) was admitted. Following intervention weekly aggression decreased from a peak of 159 incidents to zero after ten months. Other maladaptive behaviours also decreased markedly. Simultaneous attempts to improve adaptive behaviours were successful. At 11 months follow-up in the community, these gains were all noted to have been maintained.

The treatment goal is to occlude the fistula totally. However, transarterial or venous access may not be possible because of complex angioarchitecture. A woman in her late 70s presented with progressive respiratory failure and rapid deterioration of limb muscle power. Imaging studies showed an isolated CSDAVF with exclusive venous drainage to the deep venous system leading to venous hypertension as well as ischemic changes in the brain stem, left thalamus and basal ganglia. Transvascular access of the cavernous sinus (CS) failed. The fistula was eventually occluded by transorbital direct puncture of the posterior CS through the internal carotid artery (ICA) with coils delivered into the CS. The holes in the walls of the ICA created by the puncture needle were sealed by detachable coils and the patient was discharged with mild paresis. Although more invasive than the transvascular route and possibly associated with the risk of loss of visual acuity and occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, transorbital direct puncture of the posterior CS through the ICA is an alternative and feasible method to treat isolated aggressive CSDAVFs when access by the transvascular route fails.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,10.1136/neurintsurg-2011-010130,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
16464481,Sequential ordering of morphed faces and facial expressions following temporal lobe damage.,"Graham, Reiko; Devinsky, Orrin; LaBar, Kevin S",Graham,"A card ordering task was developed to evaluate the role of the temporal lobe in perceiving subtle featural displacements of faces that contribute to judgments of facial expression and identity. Individuals with varying degrees of temporal lobe damage and healthy controls were required to manually sort cards depicting morphs of facial expressions or facial identities so that the cards were sequentially ordered from one morph endpoint to another. Four morph progressions were used--three emotion morphs (neutral-to-anger, neutral-to-fear, and fear-to-anger) and an identity morph. Five exemplars were given per morph type. Debriefing verified that participants were using feature-level cues to sort the cards. A patient with bilateral amygdala damage due to epilepsy did not differ in her sorting abilities from unilateral temporal lobectomy patients or controls. In contrast, a post-encephalitic patient with widespread left temporal lobe damage showed impairments that were most marked on the fear-to-anger and identity sorts. These results show that amygdala-damaged individuals can use information contained in facial expressions to solve tasks that rely on feature-level analysis, which recruits processing in other temporal lobe regions involved in making fine featural distinctions.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.12.010,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

Survivors of traumatic brain injury constitute a heterogeneous population amongst whom problems with increased irritability and aggression are characteristic. There is a clear need to determine what treatment approaches might be helpful in reducing aggressive behaviour. Whilst single-case experimental methodologies including reversal and multiple baseline designs seem ideal for this purpose, the compelling need to minimize risk can compromise their deployment, especially when aggression takes the form of physical assaults on others. When this is the case, there are difficulties in assessing whether a change in aggressive behaviour represents a successful response to treatment or is simply a function of reduced demand in the environment. The contributions made to understanding the relationship between aggression and expectations made on patients participating within rehabilitation will be explored here. A possible means of quantifying demands using the Neurobehavioural Expectations Scale will be described.

A 45-year-old man with no prior psychiatric history, sustained subarachnoid hemorrhage. After initial stabilization for 2 days, he underwent craniotomy and clipping of anterior cerebral communicating artery aneurysm. Treatment was continued with labetalol, nimodipine, and levetiracetam. Beginning postoperative day 4, patient developed episodes of confusion and agitation/aggression. Switching of Levetiracetam to valproate did not show any improvement. Psychiatry team tried to manage him with intense nursing intervention and different medications like olanzapine, valproate, lorazepam, and haloperidol. However, patient continued to be agitated and aggressive. Switching from labetalol to metoprolol resulted in dramatic improvement within 3 days. Discussion. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often not sufficiently effective in the control of agitation/aggression in patients with traumatic brain injury and similar conditions.

RM exhibits a striking histological resemblance to other rhabdoid tumors and strong tendency towards local recurrences, CSF dissemination, and/or remote metastasis. The majority of reported cases are of secondary rhabdoid transformation in recurrent meningiomas. We present two unusual cases of rhabdoid meningiomas diagnosed as a primary intracranial lesion in adults that were associated with extensive necrosis and an aggressive clinical course. On histological examination, the majority of the tumor mass was composed of necrotic tissue with focal clusters of neoplastic cells, often localized around blood vessels. Most tumor cells exhibited typical rhabdoid morphology with large, vesicular, often eccentrically located nuclei with distinct nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm containing eosinophilic hyaline inclusions. Classical meningothelial features with focal whorl formation were scarce and seen only in one case; in the second case the tumor was entirely rhabdoid. The differential diagnosis with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) and other neoplasms, particularly metastatic carcinoma, was considered. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic study were critical for the accurate diagnosis of the rhabdoid subtype of meningiomas. Rhabdoid cells stained diffusely positive for vimentin and S-100 protein and showed focal but strong expression of epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratins. The rhabdoid areas of the tumors exhibited high mitotic activity with a MIB-1 labeling index of 80 - 90%. The diagnosis of rhabdoid meningioma was supported by evidence of SNF5 (INI1) protein expression. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated the presence of interdigitating cell processes joined by numerous desmosomes and paranuclear whorls of intermediate filaments typical of the rhabdoid phenotype. Our two cases of rhabdoid meningiomas were associated with lethal outcome within a few months of initial diagnosis. Extensive necrosis in rhabdoid meningioma might be considered an additional predictor of aggressive clinical behavior.",{},,Clinical neuropathology,10.5414/npp29307,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
