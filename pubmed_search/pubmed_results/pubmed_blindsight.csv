29100949,Plasticity of the human visual brain after an early cortical lesion.,"Mikellidou, K; Arrighi, R; Aghakhanyan, G; Tinelli, F; Frijia, F; Crespi, S; De Masi, F; Montanaro, D; Morrone, M C",Mikellidou,"In adults, partial damage to V1 or optic radiations abolishes perception in the corresponding part of the visual field, causing a scotoma. However, it is widely accepted that the developing cortex has superior capacities to reorganize following an early lesion to endorse adaptive plasticity. Here we report a single patient case (G.S.) with near normal central field vision despite a massive unilateral lesion to the optic radiations acquired early in life. The patient underwent surgical removal of a right hemisphere parieto-temporal-occipital atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the right lateral ventricle at four months of age, which presumably altered the visual pathways during in utero development. Both the tumor and surgery severely compromised the optic radiations. Residual vision of G.S. was tested psychophysically when the patient was 7 years old. We found a close-to-normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity within the central 25° and a great impairment in form and contrast vision in the far periphery (40-50°) of the left visual hemifield. BOLD response to full field luminance flicker was recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) and in a region in the residual temporal-occipital region, presumably corresponding to the middle temporal complex (MT+), of the lesioned (right) hemisphere. A population receptive field analysis of the BOLD responses to contrast modulated stimuli revealed a retinotopic organization just for the MT+ region but not for the calcarine regions. Interestingly, consistent islands of ipsilateral activity were found in MT+ and in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) of the intact hemisphere. Probabilistic tractography revealed that optic radiations between LGN and V1 were very sparse in the lesioned hemisphere consistently with the post-surgery cerebral resection, while normal in the intact hemisphere. On the other hand, strong structural connections between MT+ and LGN were found in the lesioned hemisphere, while the equivalent tract in the spared hemisphere showed minimal structural connectivity. These results suggest that during development of the pathological brain, abnormal thalamic projections can lead to functional cortical changes, which may mediate functional recovery of vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.033,,Contrast sensitivity; Cortical reorganization; DTI; Early brain lesion; Hemianopia; Neural plasticity; Retinotopic map; Visual cortex; fMRI; pRF,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
32735814,Grip Constancy but Not Perceptual Size Constancy Survives Lesions of Early Visual Cortex.,"Whitwell, Robert L; Sperandio, Irene; Buckingham, Gavin; Chouinard, Philippe A; Goodale, Melvyn A",Whitwell,"Object constancies are central constructs in theories of visual phenomenology. A powerful example is ""size constancy,"" in which the perceived size of an object remains stable despite changes in viewing distance [1-4]. Evidence from neuropsychology [5], neuroimaging [6-11], transcranial magnetic stimulation [12, 13], single-unit and lesion studies in monkey [14-20], and computational modeling [21] suggests that re-entrant processes involving reciprocal interactions between primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate visual areas [22-26] play an essential role in mediating size constancy. It is seldom appreciated, however, that object constancies must also operate for the visual guidance of goal-directed action. For example, when reaching out to pick up an object, the hand's in-flight aperture scales with size of the goal object [27-30] and is refractory to the decrease in retinal-image size with increased viewing distance [31-41] (Figure 1), a phenomenon we call ""grip constancy."" Does grip constancy, like perceptual constancy, depend on V1 or can it be mediated by pathways that bypass it altogether? We tested these possibilities in an individual, M.C., who has bilateral lesions encompassing V1 and much of the ventral visual stream. We show that her perceptual estimates of object size co-vary with retinal-image size rather than real-world size as viewing distance varies. In contrast, M.C. shows near-normal scaling of in-flight grasp aperture to object size despite changes in viewing distance. Thus, although early visual cortex is necessary for perceptual object constancy, it is unnecessary for grip constancy, which is mediated instead by separate visual inputs to dorsal-stream visuomotor areas [42-48].","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Current biology : CB,10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.026,,V1; blindsight; dorsal stream; grasping; grip constancy; neuropsychology; object constancy; re-entrant processing; size constancy; ventral stream,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
32117028,Rapid Recovery From Cortical Blindness Caused by an Old Cerebral Infarction.,"Shibuki, Katsuei; Wakui, Ichiro; Fujimura, Takeo; Tomikawa, Masaru; Hasegawa, Shin",Shibuki,"When the primary visual cortex (V1) is damaged, cortical blindness results. However, visual information obtained from the superior colliculus (SC) or direct thalamic afferents to higher visual cortices produces unconscious visual functions called blindsight. Alarming visual stimuli suggesting the approach of a predator are known to trigger escape behaviors via visual information mediated by the SC and amygdala in small animals, and salient and dynamic visual stimuli also produce some conscious visual experience even in patients with blindsight. Fresh cortical blindness sometimes recovers spontaneously in patients with fresh cerebral damages, and recovery can be accelerated by early rehabilitation. However, the mechanisms underlying recovery are not well-known. We analyzed a patient with cortical blindness caused by an old cerebral infarction. After repeated presentation of alarming visual stimuli, the ability to detect visual stimuli in the impaired visual field showed behavioral short-term improvement (STI) within a few minutes. Repeated behavioral STI induction was followed by behavioral long-term improvement (LTI) lasting more than several days. After behavioral LTI, the patient partially recovered the ability to read letters presented in the impaired visual field. The behavioral STI experiment, which can be performed within 10 min, may serve as a clinical screening test for anticipating recovery from cortical blindness.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.00069,PMC7020609,amygdala; blindsight; long-term potentiation; looming stimulus; short-term potentiation; superior colliculus; visual cortex,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
38492041,A clinico-anatomical dissection of the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in a patient with the Riddoch syndrome.,"Beyh, Ahmad; Rasche, Samuel E; Leff, Alexander; Ffytche, Dominic; Zeki, Semir",Beyh,"The Riddoch syndrome is thought to be caused by damage to the primary visual cortex (V1), usually following a vascular event. This study shows that damage to the anatomical input to V1, i.e., the optic radiations, can result in selective visual deficits that mimic the Riddoch syndrome. The results also highlight the differential susceptibility of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual systems to injury. Overall, this study offers new insights that will improve our understanding of the impact of brain injury and neurosurgery on the visual pathways. The Riddoch syndrome, characterised by the ability to perceive, consciously, moving visual stimuli but not static ones, has been associated with lesions of primary visual cortex (V1). We present here the case of patient YL who, after a tumour resection surgery that spared his V1, nevertheless showed symptoms of the Riddoch syndrome. Based on our testing, we postulated that the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) inputs to his V1 may be differentially affected. In a first experiment, YL was presented with static and moving checkerboards in his blind field while undergoing multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural, functional, and diffusion, acquired at 3 T. In a second experiment, we assessed YL's neural responses to M and P visual stimuli using psychophysics and high-resolution fMRI acquired at 7 T. YL's optic radiations were partially damaged but not severed. We found extensive activity in his visual cortex for moving, but not static, visual stimuli, while our psychophysical tests revealed that only low-spatial frequency moving checkerboards were perceived. High-resolution fMRI revealed strong responses in YL's V1 to M stimuli and very weak ones to P stimuli, indicating a functional P lesion affecting V1. In addition, YL frequently reported seeing moving stimuli and discriminating their direction of motion in the absence of visual stimulation, suggesting that he was experiencing visual hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights the possibility of a selective loss of P inputs to V1 resulting in the Riddoch syndrome and in hallucinations of visual motion.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-024-02774-8,PMC11004049,Blindsight; Magnocellular; Optic radiations; Parvocellular; Statokinetic dissociation; V5/MT + ,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Although the patient did not produce intentional responses to visual stimuli in the blind fields, he showed reduced reaction times to stimuli presented in the inferior visual fields when they were primed by identical stimuli in the superior blind fields. Furthermore he showed left extinction to the double stimulation and delayed reaction times for left unprimed stimuli in the inferior fields. Based on these findings we discuss the possibility that blindsight and right hemisphere damage might be both necessary conditions for denying bilateral blindness.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.3233/BEN-2012-110224,PMC5214380,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
22272260,Preservation of auditory P300-like potentials in cortical deafness.,"Cavinato, Marianna; Rigon, Jessica; Volpato, Chiara; Semenza, Carlo; Piccione, Francesco",Cavinato,"The phenomenon of blindsight has been largely studied and refers to residual abilities of blind patients without an acknowledged visual awareness. Similarly, ""deaf hearing"" might represent a further example of dissociation between detection and perception of sounds. Here we report the rare case of a patient with a persistent and complete cortical deafness caused by damage to the bilateral temporo-parietal lobes who occasionally showed unexpected reactions to environmental sounds despite she denied hearing. We applied for the first time electrophysiological techniques to better understand auditory processing and perceptual awareness of the patient. While auditory brainstem responses were within normal limits, no middle- and long-latency waveforms could be identified. However, event-related potentials showed conflicting results. While the Mismatch Negativity could not be evoked, robust P3-like waveforms were surprisingly found in the latency range of 600-700 ms. The generation of P3-like potentials, despite extensive destruction of the auditory cortex, might imply the integrity of independent circuits necessary to process auditory stimuli even in the absence of consciousness of sound. Our results support the reverse hierarchy theory that asserts that the higher levels of the hierarchy are immediately available for perception, while low-level information requires more specific conditions. The accurate characterization in terms of anatomy and neurophysiology of the auditory lesions might facilitate understanding of the neural substrates involved in deaf-hearing.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0029909,PMC3260175,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

By using mainly forced-choice procedures, similar to those previously used for testing hemianopic subjects, we were able to demonstrate the reappearance of some visual capacities, even though the patient still behaved as if completely blind in everyday life and the lesion remained as it was first seen. First, an ability to detect moving stimuli reappeared then bright flashes could be detected. At last, the patient could localize flickering spots approximately, by pointing with his hand, despite the fact that he did not really see them. As was hypothesized in cases of unilateral occipital lesions, such residual vision would likely to be subserved by extrageniculostriate pathways.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(80)80007-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The absence of the striate cortex was confirmed with anatomic and functional MRI and high-resolution EEG. His cortical visual impairment was severe, but he retained a remarkable ability to see fast-moving stimuli. Horizontal optokinetic nystagmus could be elicited from either eye. Resolution acuity was close to normal providing the patient was allowed to move his head and eyes. The direction of motion in random-dot patterns could be discriminated with perfect accuracy at speeds above 2 deg/s, and the patient reported that he could 'see' the motion at fast but not at slow speeds. This conscious residual vision for motion is known as Riddoch's phenomenon, but it has never been reported in the complete absence of the striate cortex. Functional neuroimaging revealed activation that was outside the motion-responsive regions of the extrastriate cortex. This case demonstrates remarkable plasticity in the human visual system and may have implications for understanding the functional organization of the motion pathways.",{},,Developmental medicine and child neurology,10.1111/j.1469-8749.2003.tb00888.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
28993236,Affective blindsight relies on low spatial frequencies.,"Burra, Nicolas; Hervais-Adelman, Alexis; Celeghin, Alessia; de Gelder, Beatrice; Pegna, Alan J",Burra,"The human brain can process facial expressions of emotions rapidly and without awareness. Several studies in patients with damage to their primary visual cortices have shown that they may be able to guess the emotional expression on a face despite their cortical blindness. This non-conscious processing, called affective blindsight, may arise through an intact subcortical visual route that leads from the superior colliculus to the pulvinar, and thence to the amygdala. This pathway is thought to process the crude visual information conveyed by the low spatial frequencies of the stimuli. In order to investigate whether this is the case, we studied a patient (TN) with bilateral cortical blindness and affective blindsight. An fMRI paradigm was performed in which fearful and neutral expressions were presented using faces that were either unfiltered, or filtered to remove high or low spatial frequencies. Unfiltered fearful faces produced right amygdala activation although the patient was unaware of the presence of the stimuli. More importantly, the low spatial frequency components of fearful faces continued to produce right amygdala activity while the high spatial frequency components did not. Our findings thus confirm that the visual information present in the low spatial frequencies is sufficient to produce affective blindsight, further suggesting that its existence could rely on the subcortical colliculo-pulvino-amygdalar pathway.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.009,,Affective blindsight; Amygdala; Facial expressions; Fear emotion; Hemianopia; Spatial frequency,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Blinded color recognition was assessed with a computerized experimental paradigm and the patient reported the degree of confidence in the response exactness on a visual percent scale. Color recognition was accurate and above chance (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.002). The degree of confidence in the answers showed a significant correlation with recognition scores (Spearman rank order correlation, p < 0.0001). These findings constitute the exceptional condition of what we called color anopsognosia (not knowing of seeing colors) and recall the theoretic figure of the 'philosophical zombie'.

A dissociation between colour and motion in blindsight.,"Chabanat, E; Jacquin-Courtois, S; Havé, L; Kihoulou, C; Tilikete, C; Mauguière, F; Rheims, S; Rossetti, Y",Chabanat,"Blindsight has been primarily and extensively studied by Lawrence Weiskrantz. Residual visual abilities following a hemispheric lesion leading to homonymous hemianopia encompass a variety of visual-perceptual and visuo-motor functions. Attention blindsight produces the more salient subjective experiences, especially for motion (Riddoch phenomenon). Action blindsight illustrates visuo-motor abilities despite the patients' feeling that they produce random movements. Perception blindsight seems to be the weakest residual function observed in blindsight, e.g. for wavelength sensitivity. Discriminating motion produced by isoluminant colours does not give rise to blindsight for motion but the outcome of the reciprocal test is not known. Here we tested whether moving stimuli could give rise to colour discrimination in a patient with homonymous hemianopia. It was found that even though the patient exhibited nearly perfect performances for motion direction discrimination his colour discrimination for the same moving stimulus remained at chance level. It is concluded that easily discriminated moving stimuli do not give rise to colour discrimination and implications for the 3 levels of blindsight taxonomy are discussed.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.006,,Attention-blindsight; Colour; Cortical blindness; Dorsal stream; Motion; Perception-blindsight; Vision,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

21763441,Awareness-related activity in prefrontal and parietal cortices in blindsight reflects more than superior visual performance.,"Persaud, Navindra; Davidson, Matthew; Maniscalco, Brian; Mobbs, Dean; Passingham, Richard E; Cowey, Alan; Lau, Hakwan",Persaud,"Many imaging studies report activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortices when subjects are aware as opposed to unaware of visual stimuli. One possibility is that this activity simply reflects higher signal strength or the superior task performance that is associated with awareness. To find out, we studied the hemianope GY who has unilateral destruction of almost all primary visual cortices. He exhibits 'blindsight', that is, he claims to have no conscious visual phenomenology (i.e., no visual qualia), for stationary stimuli presented to his right visual field (the blind field), although he can press keys to distinguish between different stimuli presented there. We presented to him a visual discrimination task, and equated performance for stimuli presented to the left or right visual field by presenting low contrast stimuli to his normal (left) field and high contrast stimuli to his blind (right) field. Superior accuracy can be a serious confound, and our paradigm allows us to control for it and avoid this confound. Even when performance was matched, and the signal strength was lower, visual stimulation to the normal (conscious) field led to higher activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortices. These results indicate that the activity in the prefrontal and parietal areas that has been reported in previous studies of awareness is not just due to a (signal strength or performance) confounds. One possibility is that it reflects the superior 'metacognitive' capacity that is associated with awareness, because GY was better able to distinguish between his own correct and incorrect responses for stimuli presented to his normal field than to his blind field.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,NeuroImage,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.081,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

No studies, however, have investigated blind smell - the hypothetical olfactory counterpart of blindsight (Weiskrantz et al., 1974). In this report, free and cued olfactory identification of suprathreshold odorants varying in irritancy (i.e., low or no irritant odours versus irritant odours), and taste identification abilities, were examined in patient MB who had undergone surgery for a meningioma. Post-operative imaging revealed encephalomalacia in the left gyrus rectus, with ablation of the left olfactory bulb and damage to the right, subcortical abnormality on the left near the orbital cortex, and damage to a small section of the right gyrus rectus. On free identification MB, while denying a capacity to smell the odours, still correctly identified some and detected others significantly above chance. In contrast, awareness always accompanied correct detections of irritant odours. Cued odour identification was at chance and no taste impairments were observed.

7597090,Parameters affecting conscious versus unconscious visual discrimination with damage to the visual cortex (V1).,"Weiskrantz, L; Barbur, J L; Sahraie, A",Weiskrantz,"When the visual (striate) cortex (V1) is damaged in human subjects, cortical blindness results in the contralateral visual half field. Nevertheless, under some experimental conditions, subjects demonstrate a capacity to make visual discriminations in the blind hemifield (blindsight), even though they have no phenomenal experience of seeing. This capacity must, therefore, be mediated by parallel projections to other brain areas. It is also the case that some subjects have conscious residual vision in response to fast moving stimuli or sudden changes in light flux level presented to the blind hemifield, characterized by a contentless kind of awareness, a feeling of something happening, albeit not normal seeing. The relationship between these two modes of discrimination has never been studied systematically. We examine, in the same experiment, both the unconscious discrimination and the conscious visual awareness of moving stimuli in a subject with unilateral damage to V1. The results demonstrate an excellent capacity to discriminate motion direction and orientation in the absence of acknowledged perceptual awareness. Discrimination of the stimulus parameters for acknowledged awareness apparently follows a different functional relationship with respect to stimulus speed, displacement, and stimulus contrast. As performance in the two modes can be quantitatively matched, the findings suggest that it should be possible to image brain activity and to identify the active areas involved in the same subject performing the same discrimination task, both with and without conscious awareness, and hence to determine whether any structures contribute uniquely to conscious perception.",{},,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.92.13.6122,PMC41654,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Computerized perimetry indicated a left visual field defect only although MRI and 18FDG-PET scans showed abnormalities in both occipital lobes. The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.",{},,NeuroImage,10.1006/nimg.1998.0390,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

There are two main types of restorative rehabilitation in hemianopia: ""border training"" which involves exercising vision at the edge of the damaged visual field, and ""blindsight training,"" which is based on exercising the unconscious perceptual functions deep inside the blind hemifield. Only border effects have been shown to be facilitated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This pilot study represents the first attempt to associate the modulatory effects of tDCS over the parieto-occipital cortex to blindsight treatment in the rehabilitation of the homonymous hemianopia. [Subjects and Methods] Patients TA and MR both had chronic hemianopia. TA underwent blindsight treatment which was combined with tDCS followed by blindsight training alone. MR underwent the two training rounds in reverse order. [Results] The patients showed better scores in clinical-instrumental, functional, and ecological assessments after tDCS combined with blindsight rehabilitation rather than rehabilitation alone. [Conclusion] In this two-case report parietal-occipital tDCS modulate the effects induced by blindsight treatment on hemianopia.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of physical therapy science,10.1589/jpts.29.1700,PMC5599849,Hemianopsia; Stroke; Visual field,Case Reports,Japan,eng

In each case, the cause was bilateral infarction of the occipital lobes. Five patients had total blindness, and four had residual rudimentary vision (RRV), characterized by homonymous areas of light perception in the peripheral field and ability to detect moving objects. Only three patients had the ability to read; two of these had spared macular vision, and the other had spared left homonymous hemimaculae and spared temporal crescent. Neuroimaging and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) correlated with the extent of the visual dysfunction. Total destruction of area 17 bilaterally was associated with total permanent visual loss. The larger the amount of spared visual cortex, the better the vision. Positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated retained metabolic activity in islands of preserved area 17 in patients with some residual vision. VEPs were present in totally blind individuals. We conclude that, in humans, useful visual function is preserved only when a critical amount of area 17 is spared.

We provide a detailed case report of a patient with the Riddoch phenomenon, MC. MC has extensive bilateral lesions to occipitotemporal cortex that include most early visual cortex and complete blindness in visual field perimetry testing with static targets. Nevertheless, she shows a remarkably robust preserved ability to perceive motion, enabling her to navigate through cluttered environments and perform actions like catching moving balls. Comparisons of MC's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to a probabilistic atlas based on controls reveals that MC's lesions encompass the posterior, lateral, and ventral early visual cortex bilaterally (V1, V2, V3A/B, LO1/2, TO1/2, hV4 and VO1 in both hemispheres) as well as more extensive damage to right parietal (inferior parietal lobule) and left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VO1, PHC1/2). She shows some sparing of anterior occipital cortex, which may account for her ability to see moving targets beyond ~15 degrees eccentricity during perimetry. Most strikingly, functional and structural MRI revealed robust and reliable spared functionality of the middle temporal motion complex (MT+) bilaterally. Moreover, consistent with her preserved ability to discriminate motion direction in psychophysical testing, MC also shows direction-selective adaptation in MT+. A variety of tests did not enable us to discern whether input to MT+ was driven by her spared anterior occipital cortex or subcortical inputs. Nevertheless, MC shows rich motion perception despite profoundly impaired static and form vision, combined with clear preservation of activation in MT+, thus supporting the role of MT+ in the Riddoch phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.05.008,PMC6991136,Blindsight; FMRI; Middle temporal area (MT+); Motion perception; Riddoch phenomenon; Vision,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng
12757903,Spatial and temporal processing in a subject with cortical blindness following occipital surgery.,"Trevethan, Ceri T; Sahraie, Arash",Trevethan,"Blindsight subjects are typically better at discriminating rapid, transient visual events than those with gradual on/off-sets. Surprisingly, the detailed investigation of temporal characteristics of mechanisms mediating blindsight is only reported in one subject (GY). It is of interest to establish whether these characteristics are similar to those in other cases of blindsight. Here, we report on a systematic study of spatio-temporal properties of mechanisms mediating blindsight in a subject VN. VN has a lower right quadranopia following surgical removal of the left occipital cortex above the calcarine sulcus, therefore, there are no remaining islands of intact visual cortex within this area. Similar to GY, the blindsight mechanisms in VN have narrowly tuned band-pass temporal characteristics with a peak sensitivity at 20Hz and above chance performance at temporal frequencies >/=10 and </=33Hz. The spatial channel in VN has low-pass characteristics with an upper cut-off <3.5c/ degrees. There is extensive spatial summation in the blindfield whereas no temporal summation was found in the time range tested (50-1600ms). In agreement with our previous reports, pupillary responses can predict the existence of residual vision within the field defect and show similar spatial characteristics to those obtained psychophysically. The spatio-temporal characteristics of blindsight in VN reported here are similar to those reported in subjects with ischaemic lesions, suggesting that such visual capacities need not necessarily be attributed to spared areas of visual cortex.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00049-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

When pupillometrically effective stimuli such as equiluminant gratings or coloured patches with an abrupt onset and offset are presented to the 'blind' hemifield, a hemianopic subject with damage largely restricted to striate cortex (V1) sometimes reports being 'aware' of the transient onset/offset, although without 'seeing' as such. The question addressed here is whether the pupil still responds in the condition of blindsight in its strict sense--i.e. discriminative capacity in the absence of acknowledged awareness--when stimuli are deliberately designed to eliminate awareness. This was accomplished by making stimulus onset and offset slow and gradual. The results with a well-studied hemianope, G.Y., demonstrate that there is still a pupillary constriction to isoluminant achromatic gratings and red-coloured stimuli, although reduced in size, in the absence of acknowledged awareness.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/122.8.1533,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Skeptics have argued that this is no different from the behavior of normal subjects at the lower limits of conscious vision, at which such dissociations could arise trivially by using different response criteria during clinical and forced-choice tests. We tested this claim explicitly by measuring the sensitivity of a hemianopic patient independently of his response criterion in yes-no and forced-choice detection tasks with the same stimulus and found that, unlike normal controls, his sensitivity was significantly higher during the forced-choice task. Thus, the dissociation by which blindsight is defined is not simply due to a difference in the patients' response bias between the two paradigms.

It tested whether extrageniculate pathways mediate inhibition of return (IOR)-a phenomenon characterized by slowed target detections at recently stimulated locations (Posner & Cohen, 1984). Because hemianopic subjects cannot overtly respond to stimuli presented within their hemianopic field, we utilized a spatial cueing paradigm that capitalized on the fact that IOR operates in spatiotopic coordinates. Subjects moved their eyes so that a cue and a target presented at the same spatial location were imaged successively onto blind and seeing portions of their retinas. One hemianopic patient showed a similar IOR effect from cues presented within both the seeing and the hemianopic fields. With a second hemianopic patient, only presentations of the cue to the subject's seeing field produced IOR. The explanation for this discrepancy is not evident.

Most of this research uses single case studies, most famously patient GY. We examined a patient (DC) after surgical resection of V1 who demonstrated robust but reversed blind field target localisation, mislocalising midline blind field targets to the periphery and vice versa. This pattern was reliable across multiple sessions and was not because of extraocular light scatter. We then used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural responses to blind field motion stimuli with no evidence of motion-selective activation in DC's extrastriate cortex in the damaged hemisphere, in stark contrast to GY who showed robust bilateral activation in response to blind field stimuli. This suggests that DC's blind field performance may not represent true blindsight. Follow-up testing with the target--background contrast reversed (i.e., black targets/white background), eliminated DC's reversed localisation, strongly suggesting that she was employing an unusual decision criterion based on intraocular light scatter.

Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of brain MR images showed no evidence of damage beyond area 18. The patient could not see his hand during reaching movements, providing a unique opportunity to test the role of peripheral visual cues in limb control. Optoelectronic recordings of upper limb movements showed normal hand paths and trajectories to fixated extrinsic targets. There was no slowing, tremor, or ataxia. Self-bound movements were also preserved. Analyses of limb orientation at the endpoints of reaches showed that the patient could transform an extrinsic target's visual coordinates to an appropriate upper limb configuration for target acquisition. There was no disadvantage created by blocking the view of the reaching arm. Moreover, the patient could not locate targets presented in the hemianopic fields by pointing. Thus, residual nonconscious vision or 'blindsight' in the aberrant fields was not a factor in our patient's reaching performance. The findings in this study show that peripheral visual cues on the position and velocity of the moving limb are not critical to the control of goal directed reaches, at least not until the hand is close to target. Other cues such as kinesthetic feedback can suffice. It also appears that the visuomotor transformations for reaching do not take place before area 19 in humans.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(96)00053-x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

To show that intensive training with flicker stimulation in the chronic stage of stroke can reorganise visual cortices of an adult patient. A 61-year-old patient with homonymous hemianopia was trained with flicker stimulation, starting 22 months after stroke. Changes in functioning during training were documented with magnetoencephalography, and the cortical organisation after training was examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both imaging methods showed that, after training, visual information from both hemifields was processed mainly in the intact hemisphere. The fMRI mapping results showed the representations of both the blind and the normal hemifield in the same set of cortical areas in the intact hemisphere, more specifically in the visual motion-sensitive area V5, in a region around the superior temporal sulcus and in retinotopic visual areas V1 (primary visual cortex), V2, V3 and V3a. Intensive training of a blind hemifield can induce cortical reorganisation in an adult patient, and this case shows an ipsilateral representation of the trained visual hemifield in several cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2006.099374,PMC2117784,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The strength of bimodal-cell response to a visual stimulus depends on its proximity to the hand. We tested the hypothesis that hand proximity to a visual stimulus would influence unconscious residual vision in the blind field. MB is a 26-year-old man with a dense upper-left quadrantanopia following surgical treatment that severed Meyer's loop, and SB is a 35-year-old man with a dense left hemianopia following childhood meningitis. Testing for ""hand-assisted"" blindsight in MB allowed us to evaluate whether phenomena related to hand proximity are dependent on information relayed through the optic radiations. We presented target objects of different sizes to the blind fields of these gentlemen, and asked them to estimate target size with their right hand by adjusting thumb-finger distance or reaching and grasping the object. Concurrently, we varied the location of the resting left hand. In the hand-far condition, the left hand rested on their lap, and in the hand-near condition, it was placed just to the left of the target object. In the hand-far condition, both patients showed no scaling of either size-estimation aperture (SEA) or peak grip aperture (PGA) to object size. In the hand-near condition, however, both PGA and SEA were scaled to object size. Additional studies of MB suggest that hand proximity effects cannot be attributed solely to changes in spatial attention. These results imply that if bimodal cells are recruited when the hand is placed nearby the visual target, they must receive information from cortical areas that do not depend on the integrity of the optic radiations.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.10.006,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Little is known on the possibility that unconscious vision is influenced by visual cues that have access to consciousness [9]. Here we report a 'blind' letter discrimination induced through a semantic interaction with conscious color processing in a patient who is agnosic for visual shapes, but has normal color vision and visual imagery. In seeing the initial letters of color names printed in different colors, it is normally easier to name the print color when it is congruent with the initial letter of the color name than when it is not [10]. The patient could discriminate the initial letters of the words 'red' and 'green' printed in the corresponding colors significantly above chance but without any conscious accompaniment, whereas he performed at chance with the reverse color-letter mapping as well as in standard tests of letter reading. We suggest that the consciously perceived colors activated a representation of the corresponding word names and their component letters, which in turn brought out a partially successful, unconscious processing of visual inputs corresponding to the activated letter representations.",{},,Current biology : CB,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)80089-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Behavioural contrast sensitivity, using the method of adjustment, and averaged visually evoked cortical potentials were measured to sinusoidally modulated chromatic and achromatic gratings in an achromatopsic patient and a normal observer. Eye movements were measured in the patient using a Skalar infrared monitoring system. The patient's chromatic contrast sensitivity was normal, indicating that despite his dense colour blindness his occipital cortex still processed information about spatial variations in hue. His sensitivity to achromatic gratings was depressed particularly at high spatial frequencies, possibly because of his jerk nystagmus. These behavioural results were reinforced by the nature of visually evoked responses to chromatic and achromatic gratings, in which total colour blindness coexisted with an almost normal cortical potential to isoluminant chromatic gratings.

Pursuit of an imagined target using peripheral cues showed reduced variance but not increased gain with blind-field cues. Preceding blind-field prompts shortened reaction times to visible targets by about 10 msec, but there was no attentional crowding of visible stimuli by blind-field distractors. A similar efficacy of indirect blind-field optic flow modulation was found in a second patient with residual vision after focal striate damage, but not in a third with more extensive medial occipito-temporal damage.

Surgery often results in postoperative blindness in the affected eye and thus has been abandoned as a treatment option for most patients. When these tumors are left untreated, however, progressive visual impairment ensues, which also leads to blindness. Recently, radiation therapy has gained wider acceptance in the treatment of these lesions. Experience with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in the treatment of ONSMs is limited because of the rare incidence of this tumor. We present a series of patients with ONSM who were treated with SRT. Five patients (three women, two men), ranging in age from 40 to 73 years, presented with progressive visual loss with decreased visual field, visual acuity, and color vision affecting six eyes (one patient had tumor involving both optic nerves). One patient also presented with proptosis and diplopia. Five eyes had functional residual vision (range, 20/20 to 20/40), and one eye was completely blind. All five patients were diagnosed clinically and radiographically to have an ONSM. Three were intraorbital, one was intracanalicular as well as intraorbital, and one was a left ONSM extending through the optic foramen into the intracranial space and involving the right optic nerve. The five functional eyes were treated with SRT by use of 1.8-Gy fractions to a cumulative dose of 45 to 54 Gy. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 7 years, and serial magnetic resonance imaging revealed no changes in the size of the tumor in all five patients. Four patients experienced dramatic improvement in visual acuity, visual field, and color vision within 3 months after SRT. One patient remained stable without evidence of visual deterioration or disease progression. None had radiation-induced optic neuropathy.

We examined specimens of striate cortex obtained postmortem from a 79-year-old woman with a history of amblyopia in her left eye (20/800) since age 2 from accommodative esotropia. Four years prior to her death, she suffered an ischemic infarct of the left optic disc. This injury to the left optic disc made it possible to label the ocular dominance columns using cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. The pattern of ocular dominance columns was reconstructed throughout most of the right striate cortex. No shrinkage of columns was found. In the left cortex only half the column mosaic was labelled, because the patient had some residual vision in the temporal retina of her left eye. The columns within the labelled portion of the overall mosaic appeared normal. These findings indicate that shrinkage of ocular dominance columns does not occur in humans with amblyopia caused by accommodative esotropia.

Both CT and structural MRI scans confirmed lesions in both territories of the posterior cerebral artery. No visual evoked potentials could be detected confirming complete cortical blindness. During fear conditioning, a visual cue predicted the occurrence of an aversive electric shock. Acoustic startle probes were presented during and between the conditioned stimuli. Relative to the control condition, startle reflexes were substantially potentiated when elicited in the presence of the conditioned stimuli. No such potentiation was observed prior to conditioning.

Preoperative neurological examination showed bilateral papilledema, but no visual disturbance. Cerebral angiography revealed that the aneurysm originated from the ambient segment of the PCA, and the posterior temporal, calcarine, and parieto-occipital arteries were all branched from the aneurysmal dome. Clipping of the feeding PCA trunk was performed via a left subtemporal approach. As a result of left occipital lobe infarction due to calcarine artery occlusion, right upper quadrant hemianopsia appeared after surgery, as confirmed by Goldman's perimetry. Other cerebral infarctions were identified in the junction between the left posterior internal capsule and thalamus, in the left posterior corpus callosum, and in the posterior base of the left temporal lobe due to the occlusion of the posterolateral thalamoperforating, posterior pericallosal, and posterior temporal arteries, respectively. The aneurysm was thrombosed and headache and papilledema subsided. The patient was able to detect the motion of a subject in a blind field, but consciousness of sight was absent. She was able to unconsciously move her finger toward a small penlight, and insert a paper into a slot with variable angles in the blind field. These phenomena disappeared within 4 months of the surgery.

Although responses were at chance level in the two latter conditions, motor responses were systematically influenced by both orientation and size of the stimulus. These data provide further evidence for two dissociable modes of visual information processing dealing respectively with 'what""' the object is vs 'how' to grasp it.

10811708,Intact verbal description of letters with diminished awareness of their forms.,"Suzuki, K; Yamadori, A",Suzuki,"Visual processing and its conscious awareness can be dissociated. To examine the extent of dissociation between ability to read characters or words and to be consciously aware of their forms, reading ability and conscious awareness for characters were examined using a tachistoscope in an alexic patient. A right handed woman with 14 years of education presented with incomplete right hemianopia, alexia with kanji (ideogram) agraphia, anomia, and amnesia. Brain MRI disclosed cerebral infarction limited to the left lower bank of the calcarine fissure, lingual and parahippocampal gyri, and an old infarction in the right medial frontal lobe. Tachistoscopic examination disclosed that she could read characters aloud in the right lower hemifield when she was not clearly aware of their forms and only noted their presence vaguely. Although her performance in reading kanji was better in the left than the right field, she could read kana (phonogram) characters and Arabic numerals equally well in both fields. By contrast, she claimed that she saw only a flash of light in 61% of trials and noticed vague forms of stimuli in 36% of trials. She never recognised a form of a letter in the right lower field precisely. She performed judgment tasks better in the left than right lower hemifield where she had to judge whether two kana characters were the same or different. Although dissociation between performance of visual recognition tasks and conscious awareness of the visual experience was found in patients with blindsight or residual vision, reading (verbal identification) of characters without clear awareness of their forms has not been reported in clinical cases. Diminished awareness of forms in our patient may reflect incomplete input to the extrastriate cortex.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.68.6.782,PMC1736980,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
9804291,Investigating form and colour perception in blindsight using an interference task.,"Danckert, J; Maruff, P; Kinsella, G; de Graaff, S; Currie, J",Danckert,"Patients with striate cortical damage causing a hemianopic field defect can nevertheless demonstrate residual visual capacities in their blind field. Previous research investigating blindsight required patients to respond explicitly to stimuli appearing in the blind field by making forced choice judgements. We present data from a patient with a left occipital lesion resulting in a homonymous hemianopia, using the flanker task. This patient displayed a significant flanker congruency effect (FCE) for colour and letter stimuli even when they appeared in the blind field. A control patient with a lesion of the right thalamus showed no FCE in the blind field. This suggests that thalamo-extrastriate neural pathways are necessary for residual functioning in blindsight.",{},,Neuroreport,10.1097/00001756-199809140-00001,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
2395303,[Moschcowitz syndrome and retinal neovascularization with retinal detachment].,"Wiedemann, P; Heimann, K",Wiedemann,"The authors examined a patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (Moschcowitz's disease). Six months after the patient was first seen with massive bilateral vascular occlusion, she presented with advanced retinal neovascularization in both eyes and traction retinal detachment in the left eye. While traction retinal detachment is a very rare sequela of this hematologic disorder, patients with Moschocowitz's disease should be carefully examined for early signs of ocular neovascularization in order to prevent loss of residual vision.",{},,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,10.1055/s-2008-1046244,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger
