34334283,Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.,"Salehi, Parnia; Clark, Mark; Pinzon, Jeffer; Patil, Abhijit",Salehi,"Being considered among the most fatal neurological conditions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy characterized by its unknown etiology and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative symptoms that often lead to a mean survival of 6 to 12 months. The accumulation of the prionic protein causes brain matter degeneration, which leads to a set of clinical findings that include rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, tremors, cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. This clinical presentation is non-specific, which makes CJD a very difficult condition to diagnose, due to the low level of clinical suspicion. However, combining this clinical presentation with neuroimaging, a lumbar puncture and an encephalogram will help us make the correct diagnosis. We present the case of a 57-year-old male presenting to the Emergency department with complaint of personality change and intermittent memory loss. The patient's physical exam was significant for resting pill roll tremor, bilateral cogwheel rigidity, dysmetria, and shuffling gait. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed symmetric bilateral diffusion signal abnormality involving the cortex, bilateral caudate heads and putamina. Continuous electroencephalogram revealed multiple bifrontal delta discharges with triphasic morphology. Lumbar puncture was significant for presence of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid. The multiple examinations performed in conjunction with the previous findings supported the diagnosis of acute encephalopathy secondary to sporadic CJD.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.ajem.2021.07.038,,Creutzfeldt-jakob disease; Neurology; Parkinsonism,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
24398867,Extrapyramidal syndrome.,"Panda, Akhila Kumar; Bala, Kiran; Bhirud, Lomesh",Panda,"Organophosphate (OP) poisoning is a common occurrence in the rural areas of developing countries like India. Acute cholinergic crisis is one of the important causes of mortality related to OP poisoning. Delayed peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal syndromes and neuropsychiatric manifestations are the major consequences of secondary neuronal damage. This case illustrates a 14-year-old girl who ingested 50 mL of OP pesticide and developed extrapyramidal symptoms in the form of parkinsonism and hand dystonia in spite of immediate medical attention. MRI of the brain with T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences revealed bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities. Further follow-up revealed a significant clinical improvement with marked resolutions of the brain lesions. The reversible extrapyramidal symptoms with disappearance of neuroimaging findings without neuropathy or neuropsychiatric manifestations are unusual in OP poisoning.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2013-009752,PMC3903097,,Journal Article; Case Reports,England,eng

Patients may be unnecessarily treated with anti-parkinsonian drugs while their underlying vascular disease is ignored. We investigated 250 parkinsonian patients seen in our Movement Disorders Clinic for a possible vascular etiology. After excluding those with a known secondary cause such as drug-induced parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy and hyperparathyroidism, brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were performed on those who showed poor or no response to levodopa. In those with an ischemic lesion demonstrated on neuroimaging, anti-parkinsonian drugs were stopped and the patients were reassessed. Eleven patients (4.4%) had ischemic brain lesions accounting for their parkinsonism. All were initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease because of the prominence of bradykinesia and rigidity. Gait disturbance was also common, but resting tremor was distinctly absent. Three anatomical patterns with different prognosis were identified. Three patients with basal ganglia lacunar infarct recovered spontaneously, three with frontal lobe infarcts remained static and five with periventricular and deep subcortical white matter lesions had progressive deterioration. Autopsy in one patient confirmed bilateral frontal lobe watershed infarcts and the absence of brain stem Lewy bodies.

In this report, we present a rare and interesting case of parkinsonism secondary to dengue encephalitis in a young female. A 25-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with high-grade fever, generalized weakness, and altered sensorium for two days. Meningoencephalitis workup was negative but she tested positive for dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen. MRI brain showed a ""double doughnut sign"" consistent with viral encephalitis. She was managed with neuroprotective measures, a short course of steroids, and invasive mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. During the course of her treatment, she developed left upper limb rigidity, involuntary movements, and gait abnormalities with generalized bradykinesia suggestive of dengue-associated parkinsonism. She responded well to trihexyphenidyl and levodopa with significant neurological recovery and was discharged from the hospital in a condition where she could independently walk with significant improvement in dystonia. Central nervous system involvement has been well documented in arboviral illnesses caused by neurotropic viruses.

We herein report a case of parkinsonism caused by DAVF with review of previous literature. An 87-year-old woman with parkinsonism and dementia was admitted to our hospital with disturbance of consciousness and aggravated parkinsonism symptoms. Plain CT revealed low-density areas in the brainstem and left cerebellar peduncle. Magnetic resonance images revealed hyperintense lesions on FLAIR, which had elevated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, in the same lesion of plain CT. However, no edematous change was detected. CT angiograms revealed obstruction of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Dilations of the left superior petrosal sinus, left petrosal vein, and pontine veins were also noted. A low-density area on plain CT had a contrast effect. Cerebral angiography revealed a DAVF involving the left transverse sinus and fed by the left occipital and left middle meningeal arteries. Transarterial embolization (TAE) with Onyx obliterated the DAVF, and parkinsonism symptoms gradually improved. We reviewed 21 DAVF-derived parkinsonism cases, most of which were treated by TAE. Recent cases were treated with Onyx. In many cases, parkinsonism improved after endovascular treatment. DAVF-derived parkinsonism is rare but treatable by endovascular therapy.

Meningiomas, being the most common benign intracranial neoplasms, have a notable research gap regarding their association with seizures and motor deficits. This patient, who had a history of depressive disorder, persistent cephalalgia syndrome, and ataxic gait, initially presented with symptoms including ataxic gait, confusion, and headache. Imaging revealed a large, hyperdense right frontal meningioma with a significant mass effect. Following surgical resection, the patient experienced notable neurological improvement. However, in 2023, the patient re-presented with bradypsychia, bradykinesia, and memory disorders, indicating a recurrent meningioma. This case exemplifies the recurrence and complex management of meningiomas, particularly in elderly patients, and highlights the importance of individualized treatment strategies. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment approach, supplemented by radiotherapy in cases of recurrence or incomplete resection. The case underscores the need for advancements in therapeutic approaches to mitigate recurrence risks and enhance patient outcomes in meningioma management. This is especially pertinent given the tumor's predilection for older females and its varied neurological manifestations, such as ataxic gait and seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.50826,PMC10797656,ataxic gait; intracranial neoplasms; meningothelial meningioma; neurological complications; radiotherapy; seizure management; surgical resection; tumor recurrence,Case Reports,United States,eng

Here, we report a case of autoimmune basal ganglia encephalitis without retinal lesions or malignancy harboring anti-recoverin antibodies. The patient was a 67-year-old Japanese woman who developed anorexia, parkinsonism, and disturbance of consciousness 7 days before admission. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense bilateral basal ganglia lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showed no malignancy in the trunk, and dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography with dopamine transporters revealed reduced radiotracer uptake in the basal ganglia. Further, anti-recoverin IgG antibodies were detected in serum immunoblot. Based on the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune basal ganglia encephalitis with anti-recoverin antibodies and administered high-dose immunoglobulins (HD-IVIG), which led to an improvement in clinical symptoms. Anti-recoverin antibodies are paraneoplastic antibodies that explicitly bind to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins in the retina and cause retinopathy. This pathological sequence is defined as cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). However, in our case, autoimmune basal ganglia encephalitis developed without CAR syndrome or malignancy. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of autoimmune basal ganglia encephalitis showing anti-recoverin antibodies but no CAR syndrome or malignancy, which should be treated with HD-IVIG therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,eNeurologicalSci,10.1016/j.ensci.2021.100382,PMC8628202,Anti-recoverin antibodies; Autoimmune basal ganglia encephalitis; Autoimmune encephalitis; High-dose immunoglobulin; Parkinsonism,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

A history of paresthesias and self-induced trauma to the area further support the diagnosis. Neurological deficits causing trigeminal trophic syndrome may result from surgical trigeminal ablation, vascular disorders and infarction of the brainstem, acoustic neuroma, postencephalitic parkinsonism, and syringobulbia. The following etiologies of nasal ulceration should be excluded: postsurgical herpetic reactivation and ulceration, syphilis, leishmaniasis, leprous trigeminal neuritis, yaws, blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, lethal midline granuloma, pyoderma gangrenosum, Wegener's granulomatosis, and basal cell carcinoma.

A follow-up MRI did not show progression of the subdural lesion and the patient was discharged 14 days after admission without focal deficits. A 44-year-old female patient with two years of seronegative RA was admitted for severe headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting. Brain MRI showed subtle supra and infratentorial leptomeningeal involvement and a left cerebellar acute infarct. A meningoencephalitis due to etanercept was initially thought and treated with dexamethasone. The patient was discharged but had to be admitted again and a new MRI showed a progression of the leptomeningeal involvement. She worsened and required endotracheal intubation.

34776506,Video Representation of Dopamine-Responsive Multiple System Atrophy Cerebellar Type.,"Doan, Jonathan; Sheikh, Irfan; Elmer, Lawrence; Rashid, Mehmood",Doan,"BACKGROUND Multiple system atrophy cerebellar type (MSA-C) is a subtype of MSA that presents with predominant ataxia along with lesser signs of parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. Previous studies have shown benefits from carbidopa/levodopa therapy for the MSA parkinsonian subtype but few studies have focused on the MSA-C subtype. We present a video case of MSA-C that demonstrated significant improvement with carbidopa/levodopa therapy. CASE REPORT A right-handed 61-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic microvascular ischemia, mild lower extremity neuropathy, and lumbar and cervical stenosis status after decompression presented with progressive worsening gait changes over several months with acute deterioration before admission. The initial neurological workup demonstrated bilateral cogwheel rigidity; difficulty with movement initiation. including standing up from a seated position; slow saccadic eye movements; masked facies (hypomimia); right ankle clonus; bilateral upper and left lower limb ataxia; and hyperreflexia. A follow-up workup was negative for metabolic, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes, but magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy along with a ""hot cross bun sign"" suggestive of probable MSA-C according to consensus criteria, and the patient was started on carbidopa-levodopa. He subsequently demonstrated improvement in key motor domains, including his cogwheel rigidity and gait testing, and was discharged shortly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Through this case report, we highlight a significant response to L-dopa therapy beyond what is normally expected according to diagnostic criteria for MSA. MSA treatment responsiveness can vary significantly across patients, which warrants additional studies into appropriate treatment choices for patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.933995,PMC8607029,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

28424147,Treatment of Leukoencephalopathy With Calcifications and Cysts With Bevacizumab.,"Fay, Alex J; King, Allison A; Shimony, Joshua S; Crow, Yanick J; Brunstrom-Hernandez, Jan E",Fay,"Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts is a rare, autosomal recessive cerebral microangiopathy that causes progressive white matter disease, calcifications, and cysts within the brain. It is typically associated with slowly progressive psychomotor regression, seizures, and movement disorders. Although leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts affects only the central nervous system, it demonstrates remarkable neuropathologic and radiologic overlap with Coats plus, a disorder of small vessels of the brain, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and bone. Coats disease without extraocular involvement, a genetically distinct disorder from Coats plus, is characterized by retinal telangiectasias and exudative retinopathy, accompanied by neovascularization. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling with the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab can improve retinal edema and exudates in Coats disease. Given these observations, we reasoned that VEGF inhibition might also be effective in treating leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts and Coats plus, neither of which has any known therapy.

We report two cases of brain metastasis in which tumor cells were restricted to the vascular lumina without parenchymal involvement, resulting in ischemic lesions. The first patient is a previously healthy young woman who presented with symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia and progressed to respiratory failure. Computed tomography of the brain showed infarcts of differing ages. At autopsy, she was found to have widely metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma and cerebral tumor emboli with multifocal infarcts, mainly microinfarcts. The second patient is an elderly man with cognitive impairment and mild Parkinsonism who presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed atrophy and changes suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Postmortem examination demonstrated prostatic adenocarcinoma and cerebral tumor emboli with multifocal infarcts. These cases illustrate that this pattern of intracranial metastasis may rarely be a cause of cerebral ischemic lesions and emphasize the importance of thorough pathologic examination of the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain tumor pathology,10.1007/s10014-020-00367-x,,Autopsy; Cerebral intravascular carcinomatosis; Cervical squamous cell carcinoma; Infarct; Prostatic adenocarcinoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng
34788867,Acute Parkinsonism in a Patient with Spinal Cord Injury: A Case Report.,"Perrotta, Francesco; Perrini, Marco Paolo; Cantatore, Lea Pia",Perrotta,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism, a clinical syndrome that includes bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability. Secondary causes of parkinsonism include chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, clear physiopathologic association between spinal cord injury (SCI) and PD has not been well described yet. We describe a rare/unusual case of a patient with C7-D1 fracture/listhesis who, 12 days after the trauma, developed a progressive cognitive impairment together with mandibular tremor. Seven days after the onset of symptoms, because of the persistence of mandibular tremor and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4, therapy with L-DOPA/benserazide was started, which resulted in gradual reduction of symptoms and complete recovery of consciousness. This could be the first report of PD appearing only 12 days after an SCI in the acute stage. Early differential diagnosis on the first manifestations of this kind of symptoms should be considered in patients with SCI to set up the right therapy essential for improving the outcome and preventing devastating consequences. This might also provide insights into the potential pathophysiologic responses of the brain after primary (immediate) and secondary (delayed) damages.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,"Journal of neurological surgery.

Antecedent clinical insult could rarely unmask latent neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an autopsy-proven case of corticobasal degeneration which was preceded by a lacunar infarction. A 58-year-old man presented with acute ataxia associated with a lacunar infarction in the right paramedian pons. His ataxia persisted with additional progressive gait difficulty and left arm clumsiness. Six months later, a follow-up neurological examination showed asymmetrical bradykinesia, apraxia, dystonic posturing, postural instability, and mild ataxia of the left limbs. Cognitive examination revealed frontal executive dysfunction and visuospatial difficulties. Dopamine transporter imaging scan demonstrated bilateral reduced uptakes in mid-to-posterior putamen, more prominent on the right side. Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, asymmetric limb dystonia, and ideomotor apraxia became more conspicuous, while limb ataxia gradually vanished. The patient became unable to walk without assistance after 1 year, and died 4 years after the symptom onset. Autopsy findings showed frontoparietal cortical atrophy, ballooned neurons, and phosphorylated tau-positive astrocytic plaques and neuropil threads with gliosis and neuronal loss, confirming the corticobasal degeneration. The case illustrates that precedent clinical events such as stroke might tip a patient with subclinical CBS into overt clinical manifestations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02178-9,PMC8022434,Autopsy; Case report; Corticobasal degeneration; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The patient presented with a mixed cerebellar and parkinsonian syndrome, incomplete levodopa response, and autonomic failure. The clinical diagnosis was multiple system atrophy (MSA). Supportive features of MSA according to the consensus diagnostic criteria included postural instability and early falls, early dysphagia, pyramidal signs, and orofacial dystonia. Multiple exclusion criteria for a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) were present. Neuropathological examination of the left hemisphere and the whole midbrain and brainstem revealed LBD, neocortical-type consistent with iPD, hippocampal sclerosis, and widespread neoplastic infiltration by an anaplastic astrocytoma without evidence of a space occupying lesion. There were no pathological features of MSA. The classification of atypical parkinsonism was difficult in this patient. The clinical features and disease course were confounded by the coexistent tumor, leading to atypical presentation and a diagnosis of MSA. We suggest that the initial features were due to Lewy body pathology, while progression and ataxia, pyramidal signs, and falls were accelerated by the occurrence of the astrocytoma. Our case reflects the challenges of an accurate diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism, the potential for confounding co-pathology and the need for autopsy examination to reach a definitive diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12848,PMC10084019,Lewy body disease; anaplastic astrocytoma; atypical parkinsonism; multiple system atrophy; neuropathology,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Manifestations of DPHL are diverse and include dementia, gait disturbance, incontinence, pyramidal tract signs, parkinsonism, chorea, mood and thought disorders, akinetic mutism, and rarely catatonia. We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL. The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL. No treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psychotropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT. There are 7 case reports of neurologic decompensation during ECT treatment after a cerebral hypoxic event. Caution is advised when considering ECT for catatonia when delayed sequelae of cerebral hypoxia are on the differential diagnosis, as there is a dearth of evidence to support this treatment approach.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Psychosomatics,10.1016/j.psym.2014.03.010,PMC4182149,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

After correcting the metabolic disturbances and evading the identified toxic substances, magnetic resonance imaging showed regression of the lesions, and the patient returned to a normal state. The functions of the basal ganglia are complex, requiring increased use of glucose and oxygen, therefore presenting a high metabolic activity, which makes them vulnerable to various metabolic changes. We report a rare case affected by symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and presenting an acute onset of altered mental status with behavioral alterations, related to hyperglycemia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and exposure to toxic substances (smoke from bonfires and/or toxic chemical components).

Other disorders can mimic MSA, but it is unknown whether cerebrovascular pathology, so-called ""vascular parkinsonism,"" can mimic MSA. This study aimed to determine the clinicopathological features and red flags for vascular parkinsonism masquerading as MSA. Using a brain bank database, we screened 270 patients with an antemortem diagnosis of MSA, who did not have pathologic evidence of MSA, but rather cerebrovascular pathology, including leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, and microinfarcts. Histologic sections from the neocortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed to characterize the clinical features. The probability of a clinical diagnosis of MSA was assigned retrospectively, guided by current consensus criteria. Four patients had cerebrovascular pathology without neurodegenerative processes. Chronic ischemic changes in periventricular white matter, subcortical leukoencephalopathy, lacunar infarcts, or microinfarcts were detected in basal ganglia of all patients. Cerebrovascular pathology that might contribute to autonomic failure was not identified. Clinically, two patients were diagnosed with possible MSA-parkinsonism, one with probable MSA-parkinsonism, and one with possible MSA-cerebellar type; however, they also had one or more non-supporting features of MSA (e.g., onset >75-years of age, dementia), vascular risk factors, and other etiologies (e.g., autonomic neuropathy) that could cause autonomic failure.

Contrast-enhanced MRI showed a well-defined tumor in the left frontal lobe convexity with extensive perilesional edema. A tumor excision was done and histopathology studies revealed an angiomatous meningioma subtype. This case is reportable because angiomatous meningioma is a recognized rare entity. It is important to share this entity with other medical professionals and start to consider this condition in differential diagnosis when diagnosing a patient with an intracranial mass with an extensive peritumoral edema. Furthermore, the patient's unusual presentation of parkinsonian features and its occurrence with colorectal cancer history suggest a possible association between these conditions.",{},,Brain tumor research and treatment,10.14791/btrt.2022.0029,PMC10172010,Angiomatous meningioma; Central nervous system neoplasms; Colorectal neoplasm; Neoplasms; Research,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

She had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement 1 year prior. Before VPS placement, brain imaging showed ventriculomegaly and chronic infarction of the right putamen and claustrum. A lumbar drain trial resulted in modest improvement of gait dysfunction. She underwent VPS placement for suspected NPH, but her symptoms remained unchanged. Examination revealed mild cognitive impairment, left-sided and lower body predominant parkinsonism, as well as disproportionately prominent postural instability. Gait analysis showed increased gait variability, reduced velocity and shortened step length bilaterally. Motor and gait abnormalities did not change after administration of levodopa. Her symptoms have remained stable for up to 52 months since symptom onset.

Although it usually occurs in acute intoxication with high doses of disulfiram, late onset encephalopathy has also been reported. Some authors propose the inhibition of dopamine beta-hydroxylase mediated by toxic metabolites of disulfiram as the main responsible, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this report was to describe the clinical and neuroimaging findings in an unusual case of acute encephalitis due to disulfiram toxicity associated to chronic intranasal consume. A chronic alcoholic who referred snorted use of a very high dose of disulfiram without simultaneous alcohol intake developed an acute encephalopathy with a rapidly progressive respiratory failure. A characteristic neuroimage finding consisting in extensive bilateral symmetric involvement of both pallidal nuclei was described. Recovery and neurologic improvement were slow. Two months after the intoxication, the patient still had slight intentional tremor and a scheduled magnetic resonance imaging. showed evolution of symmetrical areas of cytotoxic edema to necrosis. Disulfiram-induced neurotoxicity must be suspect during chronic therapy with disulfiram or after acute ingestion of high doses. Symptoms such as symmetric sensory and motor neuropathy, confusion, catatonia, parkinsonism, ataxia, choreoathetosis, seizures and encephalopathy should make us rule out this disorder. A brain imaging test should be performed in these patients since a characteristic involvement of both nuclei pallidus has been described, but it is not present in all patients.",{},,Revista de neurologia,10.33588/rn.7511.2021415,,,Case Reports,Spain,eng; spa

The early assessment and timely diagnosis of post-stroke disorders is essential for influencing long-term outcomes. Localizing lesions and determining the underlying etiology is vital in targeting appropriate therapy. New and sudden onset of hemiparkinsonism with hemiparesis, rigidity, and tremor following an acute ischemic stroke is described here. This presentation was clinically diagnosed as acute post-stroke parkinsonism (APSP). The patient's level of impairment was significant enough to compromise his activities of daily living (ADL), physical therapy (PT), and occupational therapy (OT) in an inpatient rehabilitation center. In the inpatient rehabilitation center, the patient received a trial of levodopa for suspected APSP. After levodopa therapy was initiated, we observed an improvement of his parkinsonian features with a sustained response and reached the conclusion that the clinical recognition of post-stroke parkinsonism treated with a targeted trial with levodopa may improve the quality of life.

These criteria were further assessed in a cohort of patients referred to a neurobehavior clinic with or without a history of TBI. Without a CTE biomarker, the current criteria were of limited utility when applied to the two patient and the Neurobehavior cohort. Six items were extracted as potentially improving the clinical diagnosis of CTE: length of exposure to head impacts, a progressive course, specific psychiatric symptoms, frontal-executive dysfunction, parkinsonism and tremors, and targeted findings on neuroimaging. The prevention and neurorehabilitation of CTE depends on clinical diagnosis, but, without a biomarker, the clinical diagnosis of CTE remains difficult. This report suggests that clinical criteria for CTE may be greatly improved with emphasis on several critical historical and clinical correlates of CTE.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-182452,,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

It is usually bilateral, non-tremulous, and frequently associated with pyramidal signs. Classically VP is described as lower body parkinsonism affecting predominantly the legs. A 67 years old lady presented with a history of acute onset jaw tremor, with tremor predominantly in both upper limbs. Neurological examination revealed hypomimia of the face with cogwheel rigidity and bradykinesia bilaterally, predominantly in the upper limbs without pyramidal signs. She had a marked tremor of the jaw at rest. When she was asked to open her mouth the tremor was re-emergent. Non contrast CT scan of her brain revealed an infarction in the region of putamen on the left with no evidence of diffuse subcortical white matter ischemia or extension to the caudate nucleus. She was treated with levodopa and responded well to medication. This case describes atypical clinical features which could be associated with VP including jaw tremor. This case also stresses the importance of initiating a trial of levodopa as certain patients may respond well to medication.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-018-1093-5,PMC6026506,Jaw tremors; Unilateral lenticular infarction; Vascular parkinsonism,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Asymmetric parkinsonism and cortical dysfunctions are classical features of CBD. However, symmetric parkinsonism, frequent falls, and supranuclear gaze palsy are key features of PSP. Despite biochemically classified as 4R tauopathies, tufted astrocytes of PSP and astrocytic plaque of CBD show pathologically important differences. Herein, we report a 68-year-old man with pathologically confirmed CBD. He was clinically suspected to have PSP because of progressive gait disturbances, frequent falls, and vertical saccade limitation. Neurological examination performed at age 71 revealed symmetrical bradykinesia, axial rigidity, and postural instability with worsening of early existing symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain taken at age 70 detected midbrain and left frontotemporal atrophy and right middle cerebral artery infarction. Left frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism and asymmetrically decreased fluoro-propyl-carbomethoxy-iodophenyl-tropane uptake in the basal ganglia were observed. The autopsy was performed at the time of his death (at age 72), which revealed severe pallor of the substantia nigra and mildly hypopigmented locus ceruleus. AT8 immunohistochemistry and Gallyas staining revealed tau-positive neuronal and glial inclusions, astrocytic plaques, ballooned neurons, and numerous threads in both gray and white matter. No abnormal inclusions were revealed by beta-amyloid, α-synuclein and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. In our case, cerebral infarction, periventricular and deep white matter ischemic changes, and midbrain atrophy were likely to produce PSP-CBD overlapping symptoms. However, our patient was finally confirmed to have CBD based on pathological findings such as astrocytic plaques.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of Korean medical science,10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e183,PMC9171350,Astrocytic Plaques; Corticobasal Degeneration; Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; Tuft Astrocytes,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

A 69-year-old man, with a history of hypertension and diabetes, was admitted to our hospital because of parkinsonism and dementia. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) revealed a thrombus in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and marked dilation of the medullary vein suggestive of the presence of comorbid DAVF. A single-photon emission CT (SPECT) showed widespread hypoperfusion in the bilateral frontal lobes. Selective cerebral angiography revealed a DAVF in SSS. These symptoms were significantly ameliorated following transvenous embolisation of the venous sinus at the shunting point. Reversible parkinsonism and dementia after embolisation was correlated with decreased dilation of medullary vein on SWI and improved cerebral blood flow on SPECT in the frontal lobes. Differentiation of parkinsonian and dementia symptoms due to DAVF from those associated with neurodegenerative disease is of great importance because DAVF-associated deficits may be reversed by endovascular therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2014-203921,PMC4054405,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Rarely, PLS may present with clinical features resembling parkinsonism resulting in occasional misdiagnosis as one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Here we describe five patients initially referred with a diagnosis of levodopa-unresponsive atypical parkinsonism (n = 4) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 1), but subsequently found to have features consistent with PLS instead. Onset age varied from 49 to 67 years. Unilateral limb slowness or clumsiness was the initial complaint in four, and bulbar symptoms in one. Repeated finger/foot tapping was slow in all five, but without fatiguing or decrement. Spasticity with hyperreflexia, exaggerated jaw jerk and extensor plantar responses were eventually seen in all patients. Anterior horn cell involvement developed in three cases. Early gait disturbances resulting in falls were seen in all patients and none of them responded to dopaminergic medications. Two patients underwent dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT scanning with normal results. Other features included emotional lability (n = 5) and cognitive impairment involving frontal subcortical systems (n = 1). In conclusion, these cases represent a subgroup of PLS patients in whom pyramidal slowness may be mistaken for akinesia, and spasticity misconstrued as rigidity, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism. However, the absence of fatiguing and decrement on repeated finger/foot tapping should help to distinguish these patients from the true atypical parkinsonian syndromes.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.21645,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Encephalitis manifested with persistent hiccups, seizures and impairment of consciousness. After 2 weeks, the initial neurologic symptoms subsided and the patient progressively developed movement disorders (rigidity and bradykinesia, resistant to L-DOPA), lethargy and behavioral hypersomnia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thalamic and hippocampal signal abnormalities, immunohistochemistry on a mouse brain substrate revealed serum autoantibodies binding to the brainstem neuropil. Polysomnographic monitoring was consistent with a very severe disruption of sleep: the sleep-wake cycle was fragmented, and the NREM-REM ultradian cycle was irregular. Intravenous immune globulin therapy resulted in the complete reversal of the movement and the sleep disorders. Our observation confirms that parkinsonism and sleep disorders may be consequences of encephalitis, that an immune-mediated pathogenesis is likely, and, consequently, that immunotherapy can be beneficial in these patients. The polysomnographic monitoring suggests that lethargia, rather than a mere hypersomnia, is the result of a combination between sleep disruption and altered motor control.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059416645706,,encephalitis; encephalitis lethargica; hypersomnia; immunoglobuline; polysomnography; post-encephalitic parkinsonism; sleep,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-021-10560-3,PMC8059684,COVID-19; FDG-PET/CT; Neuroimaging; Neurological complications; Parkinsonism; Parkinson’s disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Due to its rarity, it is often diagnosed as a late complication of an advanced tumor. This report presents a case study of a 72-year-old nonsmoking female with multiple comorbidities with two-week rapidly progressive cognitive decline and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). She presented with speech difficulties, tension headaches, and episodes of inattention. On examination, she had a masked face, mild bradykinesia, mild rigidity more apparent in the limbs than axially, and slight hyperreflexia in the lower limbs with a normal plantar reflex (down-going). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium showed diffuse leptomeningeal dissemination. CT of the right lower lobe showed lobe apical segment mass lesion with air bronchogram extension to the hilum, which raised the suspicion that the patient had lung cancer. The microscopic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology showed poorly differentiated malignant cells favoring adenocarcinoma. Based on these investigations, leptomeningeal dissemination on the MRI led to a wide differential diagnosis; however, given the findings in the CT scan and CSF, the patient was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis secondary to metastatic lung cancer. Although LC is a rare terminal complication that presents with a wide range of symptoms, typically including headache, altered mental status, diplopia, back pain, cerebral signs, and leg weakness, our patient presented with an uncommon presentation, which was EPS.

The substantia nigra (SN) is one of the important degenerative areas in tauopathies with parkinsonism. Nigral tau pathology is usually reported as neuronal predominant with less prominent astrocytic involvement. We aimed to identify cases with prominent astrocytic tau pathology in the SN. We use the term nigral tau-astrogliopathy (NITAG) to describe cases showing an unusually high density of ARTAG with less neuronal tau pathology in the SN. We collected clinical information and studied the distribution of tau pathology, morphological features and immunostaining profiles in three cases. Three cases, all males with parkinsonism, were identified with the following clinicopathological diagnoses: (i) atypical parkinsonism with tau pathology reminiscent to that in postencephalitic parkinsonism (69-year-old); (ii) multiple system atrophy (73-year-old); (iii) traumatic encephalopathy syndrome/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (84-year-old). Double-labelling immunofluorescence confirmed co-localization of GFAP and phosphorylated tau in affected astrocytes. Staining profiles of NITAG revealed immunopositivity for various phosphorylated tau antibodies. Some astrocytic tau lesions were also seen in other brainstem regions and cerebral grey matter. We propose NITAG is a rare neuropathological feature, and not a distinct disease entity, in the frame of multiple system ARTAG, represented by abundant tau-positive astrocytes in various brain regions but having the highest density in the SN. The concept of NITAG allows the stratification of cases with various background pathologies to understand its relevance and contribution to neuronal dysfunction.",{},,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,10.1111/nan.13000,,ageing‐related tau astrogliopathy; astrocyte; substantia nigra; tau; tauopathy,Journal Article; Case Reports,England,eng

Rare symptomatology of secondary parkinsonism attributed to pineal lesions has been previously reported in the literature. We describe an unusual case of a pineal cyst in a patient with the presenting sign of a resting tremor. We report an 18-year-old Caucasian female who presented with a 1-month history of a new-onset progressive, unilateral low-frequency right-hand resting tremor with associated headache, nausea, vomiting, and excessive diarrhea. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an atypical appearance with enhancement of a mildly prominent pineal gland, possibly representing a pineal cyst. The patient did not exhibit radiographic signs of hydrocephalus. Based upon the radiographic appearance, one could not exclude with absolute certainty the presence of a malignancy. The patient ultimately underwent a bilateral suboccipital craniotomy with gross total resection of the lesion. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited immediate resolution of her preoperative resting tremor and continues to be symptom free at 1 year. A new-onset, resting tremor and/or other secondary parkinsonism symptoms should raise clinical suspicions of pineal lesions. Treatment can be guided based on tissue type and the presence or absence of hydrocephalus.

While it has been previously studied with antemortem neuroimaging, clinicopathologic features of corticobasal syndrome associated with cerebrovascular pathology (vascular CBS) have yet to be reported. To identify vascular CBS, we searched the database of the CurePSP Brain Bank for patients with a clinical diagnosis of CBS who failed to meet neuropathologic criteria for corticobasal degeneration (CBD) or other neurodegenerative disease processes, but who had significant cerebrovascular pathology. Hemibrains were assessed macroscopically and processed for histological assessment. Medical records were reviewed to characterize clinical features of vascular CBS. Of 217 patients with an antemortem diagnosis of CBS, we identified three patients with vascular CBS. Multiple infarcts in the watershed regions (frontal lobe and motor cortex), periventricular white matter, thalamus, and basal ganglia were observed in two patients. One patient had no cortical infarcts, but had multiple white matter infarcts and corticospinal tract degeneration. All were clinically thought to have CBS based on progressive asymmetric motor symptoms, including rigidity and apraxia, as well as cognitive impairment. Antemortem imaging studies showed findings of chronic cerebrovascular disease, with infarcts or white matter pathology. This autopsy study of vascular CBS shows that, while rare, cerebrovascular pathology involving the frontal lobe, white matter tracts, basal ganglia, thalamus, and corticospinal tract can underlie clinical features suggestive of CBS. When neuroimaging suggests an alternative explanation, including chronic infarcts in critical regions, caution is merited in considering CBD as the underlying pathology.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2019.09.001,PMC7141792,Cerebrovascular pathology; Corticobasal syndrome (CBS); Corticospinal tract degeneration; Vascular parkinsonism; Wallerian degeneration,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A new kind of manganese poisoning associated with drug abuse has been reported in Eastern European countries. We present an adult patient with neurological abnormalities secondary to manganese intoxication related to the abuse of psychoactive substances. High serum levels of manganese, hyperintense lesions on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and parkinsonism in this case confirmed the diagnosis. MRI results showed accumulation of manganese in the basal ganglia which caused an increased signal in this area of the brain on T1 weighted sequence. This is the second case reported with diffuse high signal intensity of the entire white matter due to manganese and ephedron neurointoxication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such extensive pathological changes to cerebellar white matter, located near the fourth ventricle, have been described. We suggest that chronic exposure to manganese and ephedron damaged the white matter in the cerebral hemispheres and continued to affect the periventricular area of the fourth ventricle, causing continuous changes to the white matter.",{},,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,,,Parkinson’s syndrome; ephedron; hypermanganesemia; manganese intoxication; methcathinone; movement disorders,Case Reports; Journal Article,Poland,eng

Dysfunction of the extrapyramidal system and the thalamus, due to venous congestion of the Galenic system with subsequent parenchymal edema, is likely to represent an important pathophysiological mechanism. Here, we report a case of a 57-year-old man with a cDAVF of the straight sinus (Borden type III; DES-Zurich bridging vein shunt [BVS] type with direct, exclusive, and strained leptomeningeal venous drainage [LVD]) and subsequent edema of both thalami, the internal capsule, the hippocampi, the pallidum, and the mesencephalon. Several attempts at venous embolization were unsuccessful, and the neurological condition of the patient further deteriorated with progressive parkinsonism and intermittent episodes of loss of consciousness (KPS 30). A suboccipital mini-craniotomy was performed and the culminal vein was disconnected from the medial tentorial sinus, achieving an immediate fistula occlusion. Three-month follow-up MRI revealed complete regression of the edema. Clinically, parkinsonism remitted completely, allowing for tapering of dopaminergic medication. His cognition markedly improved in further course. The purpose of this report is to highlight the importance of rapid and complete cDAVF occlusion to reverse venous hypertension and prevent progressive clinical impairment. The review of the literature underlines the high morbidity and mortality of these patients. Microsurgical disconnection of the fistula plays an important role in the management of these patients and, surprisingly, has not been reported so far.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cerebrovascular diseases extra,10.1159/000510597,PMC7670372,Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula; Parkinsonism; Shunt; Venous hypertension; Venous sinus thrombosis,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

Although it is well known that anoxic or hypoxic injury produces acute neurologic deficits, DPL typically manifests days to weeks after apparent recovery from an obtunded state, and patients with DPL demonstrate cognitive impairment, high brain dysfunction, parkinsonism, or psychosis. MRI findings of the brain demonstrate deep white matter abnormalities. We report 2 cases of DPL after hypoxia due to benzodiazepine overdose. Both of our patients had normal arylsulfatase A activity. Although DPL is seen in carbon monoxide poisoning, pseudodeficiency of arylsulfatase A activity, or drug overdose with heroin or morphine, there are only some previous studies of DPL caused by an overdose with benzodiazepine. It is unclear whether neurotoxicity from the drug in addition to hypoxia alone is involved, however, it is important to note that overdose of common drugs as sleeping medicine can cause DPL. Since DPL may often be misdiagnosed and be subjected to unnecessary treatments, it is also important to understand its unique clinical course and MRI findings. With prompt recognition of DPL, we expect that more cases of DPL caused by overdose with benzodiazepine will be diagnosed, because benzodiazepine overdoses are common.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.52.672,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Acute cerebellar syndrome may occur, which can be explained by the extremely high accumulation of the drug in the cerebellum. However, presentation mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome similar to our case has never been reported. Here, we describe a 68-year-old Thai male presenting with advanced-stage cecal adenocarcinoma, as well as symptoms and signs indicative of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. He received two doses of intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg 6 hours before his symptoms occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral white matter. Further evaluation showed that his thiamine level was extremely low. Thus, he was diagnosed with fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The concomitant fluorouracil-induced thiamine deficiency eventually leads to rapid depletion of thiamine and was considered a risk factor for fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy is believed to be caused by insult causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown, but our finding suggests that thiamine deficiency plays a crucial role in fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Diagnosis is usually delayed due to a lack of clinical suspicion and results in significant morbidity requiring unnecessary investigations.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-03814-3,PMC9993653,5-FU; Chemotherapy; Leukoencephalopathy; Neuroleptic malignant syndrome; Neurotoxicity,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We highlight the clinicoradiological changes in a patient with PA and central nervous system (CNS) metastases of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL). A 68-year-old man with stage IVB extranodal NKTL developed a gait disturbance. Neurological examination of his gait revealed freezing, start hesitation, short step, forward flexion posture, festination and postural instability. Mild facial hypomimia and micrographia were observed. There was no rigidity or tremor in any of the four extremities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed T2-hyperintense lesions in the dorsal brainstem, cerebellum and periventricular white matter. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) revealed hyperintensity in these regions. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology revealed CD56-positive cells on immunohistochemical staining. The patient's neurological deficits did not respond to L-dopa treatment and intrathecal administration of methotrexate (MTX). Two weeks later, he displayed confusion and generalized convulsions. T2-hyperintense lesions spread to the basal ganglia and the infratentorial regions. Gadolinium enhancement was observed in the cerebellum and frontal subcortex. DWI and the ADC revealed diffusion-restricted lesions in the middle cerebellar peduncles, left internal capsules and cerebral white matter. MTX pulse therapy and intrathecal administration of cytosine arabinoside and MTX were performed. Two months later, his ambulatory state was normalized. Brain MRI also revealed marked alleviation of the infratentorial and supratentorial lesions.

Some patients have 2 coincidental diseases, whereas others have a Parkinsonian syndrome symptomatic to demyelinating lesions. We describe a 42-year-old female patient who developed left akinetic-rigid Parkinsonian syndrome at the age of 38 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple white matter hyperintense T2-weighted lesions. DaTSCAN revealed reduced uptake of dopamine transporter in the right striatum. Intravenous corticosteroids were inefficacious. She had major clinical improvement with levodopa and 6 months later developed peak-dose dyskinesias. At the age of 41 years, she presented with a brainstem attack, with complete symptom resolution after intravenous corticosteroids. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imagings disclosed new inflammatory lesions. Immunomodulatory treatment was started with β-interferon. In this patient, the presence of an asymmetrical Parkinsonian syndrome, with good response to levodopa, peak-dose dyskinesias, and abnormal DaTSCAN, supports the diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson disease.

To describe a married couple who were both affected by CO poisoning, but only 1 of whom developed CO-induced parkinsonism, and to discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanism of CO-induced parkinsonism by comparing the neuroimaging findings of these patients. Case report from a clinical neurology department. A married couple experienced CO poisoning simultaneously. One month later, only the husband gradually developed delayed sequelae, including parkinsonism and intellectual impairment. On detailed neurological examination, the husband showed mild but definite rigidity and bradykinesia, while no parkinsonian signs were observed in the wife. Neuropsychological examination revealed impaired memory and attention in both patients, but they were more severe in the husband than in the wife. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the patients' brains disclosed diffuse high-intensity white matter signals in both patients and bilateral pallidal necrosis in the wife. Dopamine transporter imaging showed that the degree of dopamine neuronal loss was comparable between these patients. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed more severe white matter damage in the husband than in the wife. Thirteen months later, neurological and neuropsychological examinations showed complete recovery from parkinsonism as well as intellectual impairment. Follow-up magnetic resonance spectroscopy also suggested remarkable improvements in white matter damage. These results support the role of white matter damage in producing parkinsonism after CO poisoning and highlight the possible usefulness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy in predicting delayed sequelae in patients after CO poisoning.

The background pathology of CBS is commonly a variety of proteinopathies, but association with cerebrovascular disease has also been reported. Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (FCMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by facio-pharyngo-glossal diplegia with automatic-voluntary movement dissociation presenting with bilateral paresis of the facial, lingual, pharyngeal and masticatory muscles. FCMS is commonly attributable to stroke. Transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) proteinopathy is also known as the pathological background of FCMS, while the pathological background of the majority of CBS cases consists of diverse tauopathies instead of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this report, we describe a case mimicking FCMS that was finally diagnosed as CBS with suggested 4-repeat tauopathy. A 68-year-old female started experiencing difficulty speaking followed by difficulty writing, and especially texting, several years before her visit. Her impairment had been gradually worsening, and she came to our hospital. On neurological examination, she demonstrated the facial apraxia, frontal lobe dysfunction, and upper motor neuron signs. She presented some characteristics suggestive of FCMS. Her symptoms exhibited rapid progression and myoclonus, parkinsonism, and left-side dominant cortical sensory deficit occurred, resulting in the fulfillment of diagnostic criteria for CBS after 9 months. Tau PET imaging displayed notable ligand uptake in the brainstem, subthalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, and bilateral subcortical frontal lobe, suggesting that her pathological background was 4-repeat tauopathy. As a result of her progressive dysphagia, she became unable to eat and passed away after 12 months. We hereby present an atypical case of CBS showing clinical features mimicking FCMS at first presentation.

Her past medical history was significant for a craniopharyngioma resection four months prior. The postoperative course was complicated by severe delirium, panhypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus. Notably, she was taking haloperidol and aripiprazole daily for four months to manage her delirium and psychotic episodes. Her preoperative brain MRI showed a compressive effect of the craniopharyngioma on the midbrain and nigrostriatum. Drug-induced Parkinsonism was initially suspected given extended treatment with antipsychotics. Haloperidol and aripiprazole were stopped, and benztropine was started with no improvement. Consequently, the patient was treated with carbidopa/levodopa with symptomatic improvement. A dopamine transporter (DaT) scan was done after starting carbidopa/levodopa and showed asymmetric decreased uptake in dopamine transporter in the striatum. Only one other case of Parkinsonism following craniopharyngioma resection was found in the literature review. Unlike our example, the symptoms resolved following surgical intervention and did not require a long-term treatment with carbidopa/levodopa.

Reactivation of latent Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) infections can cause neurological sequalae, including cerebellitis, post-herpetic neuralgias, meningo/encephalitis, vasculopathy and myelopathy. We propose a syndrome caused by auto-immune reactivity triggered by molecular mimicry between VZV and the brain, culminating in a post-infectious psychiatric syndrome with childhood VZV infections. Two individuals, a 6-year-old male and 10-year-old female developed a neuro-psychiatric syndrome 3-6 weeks following a confirmed VZV infection with intrathecal oligoclonal bands.

We encountered a rare case of cavernoma located in the anterior-mesencephalic region presented as parkinsonism tremor. A 42-year-old woman had a resting tremor for 10 years. This tremor involved the left shoulder and the proximal and distal limb, which was exacerbated by any attempted movement and became grossly uncontrollable. She showed a partial right ophthalmoplegia with mydriasis. Her right upper and lower extremities had normal strength, but her left extremities had three-fifth strength. Her sensation was intact. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a popcorn-like rounded lesion in the right ventral midbrain adjacent to the medial cerebral peduncle. To access this anterior-medial portion of the midbrain, we chose a frontotemporal transsylvian route via an orbitozygomatic craniotomy. With a longitudinal pial incision between the frontopontine fibers and the pyramidal tracts in the peduncle, the cavernoma was totally removed en bloc. After the operation, the tremor dramatically disappeared. The muscle strength of her left lower extremity improved to four fifths, whereas the upper extremity was still the same. The preoperative left oculomotor palsy seemed to have no improvement. Clinically manifested cavernoma due to repeated hemorrhage needs surgical intervention.

36769288,Fluphenazine-Induced Neurotoxicity with Acute Almost Transient Parkinsonism and Permanent Memory Loss: Lessons from a Case Report.,"De Masi, Roberto; Orlando, Stefania; Toni, Vincenzo; Costa, Maria Carmela",De Masi,"We report the singular case of a 31-year-old woman who developed very serious Fluphenazine-induced parkinsonism over a few days due to a doubly incongruent drug prescription by indication and dosage having been applied to a healthy subject over one week instead of seven months. Unlike gradual drug-induced parkinsonism, our patient experienced acute extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS), reaching significant motor and sphincter disability in just a few days, followed by a gradual incomplete recovery over more than six months. In fact, after drug discontinuation, hypomimia and slight left hemi-somatic rigidity with bradykinesia remained, as well as stable non-progressive memory disturbances. Despite bio-humoral and instrumental investigations and DaTScan were negative, MRI post-analysis evidenced a 6.5% loss in brain volume. Specifically, irreversible cortical and sub-cortical grey matter reduction and cerebrospinal fluid space enlargement with spared white matter were found. Our observations suggest that the sudden availability of Fluphenazine results in a kind of plateau effect of parkinsonism presentation, partially reversible due to the neurotoxic drug effect on the cortical and sub-cortical grey matter, resulting in asymmetric EPS and stable memory loss, respectively. Our report confirms the debated neurotoxicity of first-generation neuroleptics and the postulated theory of differential susceptibility to the cytotoxic stressors on the central nervous system.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,International journal of molecular sciences,10.3390/ijms24032968,PMC9917624,Fluphenazine; extrapyramidal syndrome; memory loss; neuroleptics; neurotoxicity; parkinsonism,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Parkinsonian features include bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, postural instability and poor levo-dopa response. Neuropathologically, MSA-P is characterized by selective neuronal loss and gliosis mainly affecting the putamen and caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, olivopontocerebellar pathway and intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Therefore, the target of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is focused on signal changes or volume reduction on putamen, including putaminal slit, gliosis by diffusion studies and reduction of putaminal volume. There have been no reports describing clinical manifestations of MSA-P with imaging abnormalities over globus pallidus. Here, we describe three patients with typical presentations of MSA-P with autonomic dysfunction and disturbances of axial motor function with minimal appendicular symptoms, including postural instability and gait difficulties. MRI showed symmetrical hyperintensity over the center of globus pallidus surrounded by a mild low-signal rims at T2-weighted image that is similar to that of eye of the tiger sign except for the marked hypointense rims. Dopamine transporter scans showed symmetric reduction of uptake over bilateral basal ganglia. This is the first report concerning these unusual imaging findings in MSA-P patients and we believe there is a subgroup of MSA-P with clinical presentation of axial impairment and symmetrically abnormal signal changes of globus pallidus in MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",10.1007/s00702-009-0234-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

A DAVF presenting with parkinsonism is rare, and is therefore easily misdiagnosed. Therefore, early consideration of DAVF in the differential diagnosis of reversible parkinsonism is necessary. We present the case of a 51-year-old male with progressive parkinsonism. He was diagnosed as straight sinus occlusion. Imaging studies revealed a DAVF associated with cerebral hypoperfusion of the lenticular nuclei and frontal lobe white matter. Endovascular embolization was performed through his left occipital artery. Treatment resulted in marked clinical improvement that a major improvement of parkinsonism was observed concomitant with no evidence of early venous drainage of this patient. DAVF should always be considered as a potential cause of progressive parkinsonism on account of its potential reversibility. Our case suggests a concomitant role of basal ganglia degeneration and frontal white matter hypoperfusion in the pathology of parkinsonism due to DAVF. However, the precise pathophysiology remains to be investigated.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000009005,PMC5728895,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It can manifest as hemiparesis, cortical blindness, speech changes, Parkinsonism, confusion, seizure, and coma. Most of the reported CIE cases have been transient and reversible. Irreversible fatal CIE cases have been rarely reported. All the fatal CIE cases reported involved the use of ionic high osmolar contrast agents. Here, we document a heretofore unreported fatal CIE after digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using iopamidol, which is a type of non-ionic monomer low osmolar contrast agent. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our Department of Neurology for tinnitus in the head. The cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) detected atherosclerotic cerebral arteries and bilateral stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries. The patient underwent DSA for further diagnostic work-up. The total amount of iopamidol used during the procedure was 110 ml. The patient experienced headache during the procedure, followed by dizziness with nausea and vomiting. Despite treatment with anti-oedema medications, her clinical status was gradually deteriorating and ended up with deep coma due to irreversible cerebral oedema which was confirmed by cerebral computed tomography (CT). Finally, the patient died 56 days after the procedure due to irreversible fatal cerebral oedema.

31147176,Why do neurologists miss catatonia in neurology emergency? A case series and brief literature review.,"Anand, Sucharita; Kumar Paliwal, Vimal; Singh, Laxmi S; Uniyal, Ravi",Anand,"Catatonia is a well-described clinical syndrome characterized by features that range from mutism, negativism and stupor to agitation, mannerisms and stereotype. Causes of catatonia may range from organic brain disorders to psychiatric conditions. Despite a characteristic syndrome, catatonia is grossly under diagnosed. The reason for missed diagnosis of catatonia in neurology setting is not clear. Poor awareness is an unlikely cause because catatonia is taught among conditions with deregulated consciousness like vegetative state, locked-in state and akinetic mutism. We determined the proportion of catatonia patients correctly identified by neurology residents in neurology emergency. We also looked at the alternate diagnosis they received to identify catatonia mimics. Twelve patients (age 22-55 years, 7 females) of catatonia were discharged from a single unit of neurology department from 2007 to 2017. In the emergency department, neurology residents diagnosed none of the patients as catatonia. They offered diagnosis of extrapyramidal syndrome in 7, meningitis in 2, and conversion reaction, acute psychosis/encephalopathy and non-convulsive status epilepticus in one each. Their final diagnosis at discharge was catatonia due to general medical condition in 6 (progressive supranuclear palsy in 2, post-status epilepticus, uremic encephalopathy, glioblastoma multiforme and tuberculous meningitis in one each), catatonia due to major depression in 4, schizophrenia and idiopathic catatonia in one each. Extrapyramidal syndrome appeared as common mimic of catatonia. The literature reviewed also revealed the majority of organic catatonia secondary to causes that are usually associated with extrapyramidal features. Therefore, we suggest that neurologists should consider catatonia in patients presenting with extrapyramidal syndromes.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2019.105375,,Catatonia; Extrapyramidal disorder; Major depression; Parkinsonism; Schizophrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng

24390157,Parkinsonian syndrome and ataxia as a presenting finding of acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.,"Miletić, Vladimir; Ozretić, David; Relja, Maja",Miletić,"The term ""acquired hepatocerebral degeneration"" (AHD) was coined to describe clinical entity distinct from genetically defined Wilson's disease. AHD is chronic neurological disorder, characterized by extrapyramidal and neuropsychiatric symptoms accompanied with advanced liver disease with portosystemic shunts. In majority of AHD cases, extrapyramidal symptoms appear in the presence of known liver disease. Here we present a patient with subacute onset of bilateral, asymmetric, hypokinetic-rigid syndrome and ataxia as initial presentation of liver cirrhosis. Manganese toxicity have major role in AHD pathogenesis. Failure of liver detoxification and presence of portosystemic shunting enables neurotoxic substance of manganese to avoid hepatic metabolism and to enter and accumulate in central nervous system. Predilection brain regions for manganese deposits are globus pallidum (GP) and substantia nigra (SN). Characteristic MRI findings of bilateral, symmetrical hyperintensities of GP and SN on T1-weighted sequences supported the diagnosis of AHD in our patient. In addition, increased T2 signal in dendate nuclei seen in our patient is rare radiological finding. So far, no consensus guidelines regarding medical treatment of AHD exist. We initiated low-dose levodopa treatment, but failed to provide beneficial effect. In conclusion, AHD is distinct clinical entity that should be included in differential diagnosis of both typical and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Furthermore, our case highlights the importance of performing MRI in patients with atypical parkinsonism.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Metabolic brain disease,10.1007/s11011-013-9478-z,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Accordingly, we performed a pathoanatomical analysis on serial thick sections stained for lipofuscin granules and Nissl substance through the thalami of two genetically confirmed cases: one an SCA2 patient, the other an SCA3 patient. During this systematic study, we detected severe destruction of the reticular (RT), fasciculosus (FA), ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), ventral posterior lateral (VPL), ventral posterior medial (VPM), cucullar (CU) and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei (MD), the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and inferior nucleus of the pulvinar (PU i) in the SCA2 case, and a severe neuronal loss in the RT, FA, VA and PU i of the SCA3 case. In the SCA2 patient, additional obvious neuronal loss was observed in all nuclei of the anterior and rostral intra laminar groups, in the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), the lateral (PU l) and the medial subnuclei of the pulvinar (PU m), whereas in the SCA3 patient only two of the nuclei that belong to the anterior thalamic group, the VL, VPL, VPM, LP, LGB, PU l and PU m, displayed marked neurodegeneration. These novel findings indicate that thalamic involvement in SCA2 and SCA3 patients has been underestimated in the past. In view of what is known about the functions of the affected thalamic nuclei, the present findings provide an appropriate pathoanatomical explanation for some of the disease-related symptoms seen in both of our and other SCA2 and SCA3 patients: gait, stance, truncal and limb ataxia, dysarthria or anarthria, falls, dysdiadochokinesia and bradykinesia, problems with writing, somatosensory deficits, saccadic dysfunctions, executive dysfunctions and abnormalities of visual evoked potentials.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awg234,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

There are also a few reports on metformin-induced encephalopathy, which is clinically similar to diabetic uremic syndrome. Because some patients with each of these diseases also have metabolic acidosis, it is speculated that these two diseases may have the same pathology. Recently, the term ""extrapyramidal syndromes of chronic kidney disease and dialysis"" (EPS-CKDD), with associated diagnostic criteria, has been proposed to describe these conditions, and metformin use is considered a risk factor for developing these syndromes. We report a case of a patient on maintenance hemodialysis for diabetic nephropathy who was taking metformin and developed subacute parkinsonism and bilateral basal ganglia lesions that rapidly improved after discontinuation of metformin with continued maintenance hemodialysis. We should ascertain whether patients with EPS-CKDD are taking metformin because it may be inappropriately prescribed for end-stage renal disease.

Brain atrophy and infarcts were not observed, and pigmentation in the substantia nigra was preserved. Histologically, there was a slightly lesser degree of neuronal loss with astrocytosis in the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, and dorsal vagal nucleus. Lewy bodies were not found. In the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia, Alzheimer Type II astrocytes, which are abundant in hepatic encephalopathy, had deposition of electron-dense materials within the lysosomes and mitochondrial matrices.

Clinical spectrum includes a wide range of movement disorders such as acute parkinsonism. Imaging studies show reversible (with hemodialysis) bilateral lesions in the lenticular nuclei. DUS pathophysiology has not been entirely clarified yet. Our case study shows certainly that LN lesions are characterized with increased lactate peak with MR spectroscopy and decreased perfusion in computerized tomography perfusion along with increased diffusion with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping in the subacute phase of the syndrome. Abnormalities were almost normalized quickly after metabolic control by hemodialysis. Together with reports indicating that a deficit of glucose use exacerbated with acute increase of uremic toxins in bilateral LN, observed changes (lactate peak and hypoperfusion) led us to state that a primary metabolic depression may cause this syndrome. Metabolic depression is probably due to uncompensated uremic toxin accumulation related mitochondrial supression and/or dysfunction. This definition fits well to the other elements of DUS such as ADC evolution and marked lesion regression. Our single case study is not supportive of other previously credited mechanisms such as microvascular dysfunction related focal ischemia or hypoperfusion, prolonged uremic toxin related histotoxic hypoxia, central pontine myelinolysis-like demyelination and posterior leukoencephalopathy spectrum disorder related vasogenic edema.",{},,Metabolic brain disease,10.1007/s11011-013-9427-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Both cases had no motor, sensory, cerebellar, or autonomic involvement. The pathophysiology of central nervous system (CNS) infections in scrub typhus is attributed to three major mechanisms of vasculitis, direct invasion, and immune-mediated. CNS involvement in scrub typhus is a significant marker for risk of mortality or morbidity. The most common CNS manifestations in scrub include meningitis, encephalitis, and seizures.

Neuro-imaging revealed compression and distortion of the basal ganglia by large tumours which were identified histopathologically as meningiomas in four patients and as an epidermoid, a fibrillary astrocytoma, an anaplastic oligodendroglioma and a glioblastoma. Six patients underwent tumour removal by craniotomy, in two the histopathology was obtained by stereotactic biopsy. Four patients were free of Parkinsonian symptoms and signs on long-term follow-up. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved are discussed. Since some of these patients closely resemble cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and the movement disorder can precede other symptoms and signs or will remain isolated in the further course, the diagnosis of an intracranial neoplasm was generally delayed in these patients. Increased awareness of this rare entity may lead to an earlier diagnosis.

A 72-yr-old, right-handed man, came to our observation because of a disabling tremor affecting his upper limbs, refusing any invasive surgical procedure and already treated by tcMRgFUS left Vim thalamotomy. However, clinical benefit had brief duration, as a progressive recurrence of tremor on the right upper limb was observed after a few months from the first treatment. Thus, the patient underwent a new left-sided tcMRgFUS procedure 6 mo after the former treatment. After the second procedure, an immediate and complete relief from tremor on the right upper limb was achieved with clinical benefit that persisted up to a 6-mo follow-up. Since tcMRgFUS doesn't use ionizing radiations and it is incision-less, repeated and staged treatment procedures have always been hypothesized. Our report suggests that tcMRgFUS retreatment might actually be a feasible, safe, and effective option in selected patients in whom an optimal clinical outcome is not achieved after the first treatment session.

12549720,Multiple sclerosis and parkinsonism: a case report.,"Ozturk, Vesile; Idiman, Egemen; Sengun, Ihsan S; Yuksel, Zafer",Ozturk,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a well-known disease characterized by the distribution of plaques in the periventricular and subcortical white matter. Although plaques can also be found in the striatum, pallidum and thalamus, extrapyramidal symptoms are very rare in MS. However, the association of MS and parkinsonism is still a controversial topic as it has not been established whether these two conditions occur coincidentally or causally. In the literature, eleven cases of parkinsonism associated with MS have been described. Here, we report a patient with clinically definite MS and signs of parkinsonism. Our patient had slow progressive bradykinesia, static tremor and bradymimia that were not associated with exacerbation or progression of the MS. This rare and interesting association of multiple sclerosis with parkinsonism is discussed in the light of literature reports.",{},,Functional neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
11383733,Implantation of a reservoir for refractory chronic subdural hematoma.,"Sato, M; Iwatsuki, K; Akiyama, C; Kumura, E; Yoshimine, T",Sato,"Recurrence of chronic subdural hematoma is not rare. Among patients who experience recurrence, severe background disease may adversely influence the prognosis of chronic subdural hematoma. We treated patients with these refractory hematomas with an Ommaya cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reservoir and analyzed the effectiveness of the treatment. Sixteen patients with refractory chronic subdural hematoma were studied. These patients had severe diseases that adversely influenced the clinical course of chronic subdural hematoma, including cerebral infarction, liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, severe Parkinsonism, severe heart disease, psychiatric disease, and spinocerebellar degeneration. All patients were treated initially in the standard fashion: evacuation of the hematoma followed by irrigation and drainage of the hematoma cavity. In each patient, an Ommaya CSF reservoir was implanted after the hematoma recurred. Whenever the volume of the hematoma either decreased very slowly or increased, the reservoir was punctured. The hematoma size decreased to less than 3 mm a median of 60 days after introduction of the reservoir. Postoperatively, 13 patients returned to their condition before the onset of hematoma. One patient died of myocardial infarction, and two patients with Parkinson's disease could not maintain their previous functional level; both remained in a partially dependent state. Complications consisted of minor bleeding in two patients and occlusion of the reservoir in two other patients. By use of this method, reoperation was avoided and the patients were mobile early in the postoperative period. This method was suitable for refractory chronic subdural hematoma accompanied by severe disease that adversely influenced the clinical course.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1097/00006123-200106000-00023,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
9354260,Use of carbidopa-levodopa in a patient with hydrocephalus and frozen movement.,"Aggarwal, S; Childers, M K; Jimenez, D",Aggarwal,"While movement disorders are frequently encountered after brain injuries, and may create a host of complicated problems for the clinician, only a few cases of Parkinsonism associated with hydrocephalus have ever been described in the literature. Parkinsonism-like syndrome complicating hydrocephalus is a rare disorder, especially when associated with nontumoral aqueductal stenosis. Yet as this case report discusses, hdyrocephalus-induced Parkinsonism may be responsive to levodopa-carbidopa administration. This report describes a perplexing case of persistent akinesis following corrective surgery for aqueductal stenosis and the subsequent response to levodopa-carbidopa administration. We present the case of a 28-year-old male with a history of non-tumoral aqueductal stenosis diagnosed at age 12. As a child, he underwent a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus followed by multiple shunt revisions over the next several years. Sixteen years after his initial shunt placement, the patient presented with a decline in mental status. A third ventriculocisternostomy was performed rather than another shunt revision. Following surgery, the patient remained obtunded, and displayed profound hypokinesis, best described as freezing in movement. Upon admission to a rehabilitation unit 2 weeks later, he had made only minimal progress. A SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) brain scan revealed decreased basal ganglia perfusion. Levodopa/carbidopa therapy was initiated and within 2 weeks, the patient showed improvement in speed of movement, facial expression and verbal output. Eight weeks later, the patient could independently complete his basic activities of daily living and demonstrated little, if any, disordered movement. This report illustrates how dopaminergic agents may be useful in cases of hypokinesis following corrective surgery for aqueductal stenosis. SPECT may further aid in the diagnosis and management of Parkinsonism-like syndromes in brain injuries.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/026990597123043,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In symptomatic oculopalatal tremor the ataxia frequently is delayed in onset. Progressive ataxia is a defining clinical feature of superficial siderosis. We report 5 cases with palatal tremor and ataxia. Four cases had evidence of intraparenchymal hemosiderin deposition on T2-gradient-echo imaging. Three cases had a brainstem vascular malformation. In two cases the hemosiderin deposition was likely due to prior trauma. The significance of these associations and possible similarities between ataxia related to superficial siderosis and ataxia and intraparenchymal hemosiderin is discussed.,"DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2011.04.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The pathogenic mechanisms of diffuse encephalopathy are unclear, although vasculopathy and toxic demyelination have been proposed. Recently, we have encountered a patient who developed headache, limb tremors, gait disturbance, dysarthria, memory impairment, and emotional lability after long-term exposure to CS(2). The brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed diffuse hyperintensity lesions in T(2)-weighted images in the subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and brain stem. The brain computed tomography perfusion study revealed a diffusely decreased regional cerebral blood flow and prolonged regional mean transit time in the subcortical white matter and basal ganglion. To our knowledge, there have been few reports demonstrating diffuse white matter lesions in chronic CS(2) encephalopathy using brain MRI. In addition, the (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography showed a normal uptake of the dopamine transporter, indicating a normal presynaptic dopaminergic pathway. We conclude that diffuse white matter lesions may develop after chronic exposure to CS(2), possibly through microangiopathy. In addition, CS(2) poisoning can be considered as one of the causes of chronic leukoencephalopathy.",{},,European neurology,10.1159/000073863,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

28457650,Orthostatic myoclonus after brain tumor radiation: Insights from two lesional cases.,"Cutsforth-Gregory, Jeremy K; Hammack, Julie E; Matsumoto, Joseph Y",Cutsforth-Gregory,"Orthostatic myoclonus (OM) is a recognized syndrome of gait unsteadiness accompanied by lower limb myoclonus provoked by the assumption of an upright posture. OM typically affects the elderly and is often associated with neurodegenerative disease. We sought to review the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of OM due to brain tumor treatment, the first reported lesional cases of this rare disorder. The database of the Mayo Clinic Rochester Movement Disorders Laboratory was searched for all patients diagnosed with OM from January 2007 to December 2016. All available clinical, radiographic, and surface electromyographic data were reviewed, and patients with a history of primary or metastatic brain tumor were analyzed. Two patients with OM and brain tumor were identified; both had undergone tumor resection and targeted brain radiation. Both patients complained of unsteadiness while walking and recurrent falls. Tumor pathology (atypical meningioma, gliosarcoma) was centered in the frontal lobe and extended to the supplementary motor area (SMA), pre-SMA, or prefrontal cortex. Medications did not improve gait. Two cases of brain tumor-related OM suggest that degeneration of frontal motor programming circuits underlies the pathophysiology of OM.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2017.04.015,,Brain radiation; Brain tumor; Gait unsteadiness; Orthostatic myoclonus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The level of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid was low (49 pg/mL). This observation illustrates that REM sleep behavior disorder and narcoleptic features are 2 REM-sleep abnormalities that (1) may share the same autoimmune-mediated origin affecting the brainstem, limbic, and diencephalic structures and (2) may occur in the setting of the paraneoplastic anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis.",{},,Sleep,10.1093/sleep/30.6.767,PMC1978347,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image of brain MRI demonstrated hyperintensities at the parenchyma around the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image demonstrated enhancement along the whole wall of the ventricle. Biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes established a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient died of multiple organ failure about 5 months after the onset. Autopsy disclosed periventricular dissemination of lymphoma cells that was most severe around the lateral ventricle.

8749990,Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration: case reports and new insights.,"Jog, M S; Lang, A E",Jog,"Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD) is a heterogeneous disorder that can occur with a primary neurologic, hepatic, or combined presentation. Little has been added to the understanding of this disorder since the detailed, early clinical and pathological descriptions. The spectrum of clinical presentations can be neuropsychiatric (apathy, lethargy, excessive somnolence), a movement disorder (ataxia, tremor, chorea, parkinsonism, myoclonus, dystonia), or both. Cortical laminar necrosis and polymicrocavitation in the cortex and basal ganglia are combined with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Microscopically, Alzheimer type II astrocytes and cytoplasmic glycogen granules are characteristic. Recent neuroradiological observations in patients with liver failure have shown a specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance with a hyperintense T1 signal in the pallidum, putamen, and, rarely, mesencephalon. Using clues from a similar MR appearance in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition as well as animals given parenteral manganese, and the knowledge that manganese is cleared by the hepatobiliary system, deposition of manganese in the brain is postulated in patients with CAHD. In this review we describe three cases of CAHD with detailed clinical and radiological documentation and discuss the aforementioned pathogenetic mechanisms.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.870100604,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Some survivors of CO poisoning develop, after a lucid interval, a potentially permanent encephalopathy in the form of cognitive impairment and movement disorders, such as Parkinsonism. One of the most frequent neuroimaging findings is a cerebral white matter damage, but so far its precise cause and specific therapy are still debated. We here report the case of a 33-year-old woman with severe carbon monoxide poisoning who, after a period of lucid interval, presented symptoms of declining motor and cognitive functions. She was treated with 40 sessions of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT). The therapeutic use of oxygen at supraphysiological pressures might either increase systemic oxidative stress or cause an overproduction of oxygen free radicals as drawbacks. Concurrent use of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs may prevent the side effects of oxygen therapy at supraphysiological pressure due to oxidative stress. For this reason, the patient was also treated with high-dose N-Acetylcysteine and glucocorticoids. Here, we describe the longitudinal monitoring of patient's cognitive abilities and leukoencephalopathy associated with her positive clinical outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2019/9360542,PMC6541979,,Case Reports,United States,eng
