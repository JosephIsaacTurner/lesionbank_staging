7191497,Visual allesthesia.,"Jacobs, L",Jacobs,"A patient with a right parietooccipital arteriovenous malformation experienced paroxysmal illusory left homonymous transpositions of objects viewed in the right homonymous field. The illusory images were palinoptic, persisting for up to 15 minutes after the real objects were no longer in view. She had left homonymous hemiachromatopsia and a right parietooccipital epileptogenic focus. Episodes of visual allesthesia were accompanied by other manifestations of seizures. Administration of anticonvulsant medications resulted in cessation of electroencephalographic epileptogenic activity and disappearance of all clinical manifestations of seizures, including visual allesthesias. Cerebral irritation and seizures, a defective but not blind half-field of vision, and experience of palinoptic images are essential components of some cases of visual allesthesia. The phenomenon may result from interhemispheric transfer of a visual percept from a normal to an irritated parietooccipital lobe, which then retains it as a palinoptic image.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.30.10.1059,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
3596922,Palinopsia and visual allesthesia.,"Ardila, A; Botero, M; Gomez, J",Ardila,"Two cases of palinopsia are reported. The first patient had palinopsia and visual allesthesia secondary to an occipital calcified cysticercus. Symptoms were more prominent during treatment for his parasitic infection. The second case was a patient with long standing vascular headaches associated for many years with episodes of visual persistence; he had a right occipital lobe infarct; he reported deformation of images, illusion of movement and macropsia in his left homonymous hemianoptic visual field. Different hypotheses for explaining palinopsia have been proposed. An analysis of our cases does not prove or disprove any of the current hypotheses. However, the current hypotheses do not necessarily contradict each other. Implications of the two cases reported are analyzed.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207458709043332,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
22089541,B치lint syndrome and visual allochiria in a patient with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.,"Walsh, Ryan D; Floyd, Jessica P; Eidelman, Benjamin H; Barrett, Kevin M",Walsh,"B치lint syndrome (simultagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular apraxia) is typically caused by pathology affecting the parietal-occipital regions bilaterally. Visual allochiria is an uncommonly reported symptom associated with parietal lobe pathology in which visual stimuli presented to one hemispace are transposed to the opposite side. We describe a patient with B치lint syndrome and visual allochiria whose initial brain MRI demonstrated acute infarction of the right parietal-occipital region. Repeat imaging 9 days later revealed bilateral parietal-occipital infarctions consistent with the observed clinical syndrome. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is introduced as a novel cerebrovascular etiology of B치lint syndrome.",{},,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0b013e3182359f4a,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
15259330,"Left on the right or viceversa: a case of ""alternating"" constructional allochiria.","Grossi, Dario; Di Cesare, Gabriella; Trojano, Luigi",Grossi,"We describe a patient with an ischemic right frontal lesion and mild left neglect who showed a systematic tendency to transpose drawings on one side of the page, which varied depending on the starting point (left or right) of his graphic productions. When not specifically cued, the patient started to draw in the ipsilesional (right) side and tended to show allochiria on the right, but occasionally, or under specific instructions, the patient started drawing from the left side and then showed a complete reversion of his spatial transpositions. To clarify the basic mechanisms underlying such a peculiar constructional phenomenon, we performed a series of experimental investigations, including extended copying tasks, a clock-marking test (to mark the position of single hours on a clock-face), and a line bisection task with progressive left-toright or right-to-left stimulus presentation. Findings suggested that ""alternating"" allochiria in copying and drawing from memory tasks is an epiphenomenon of a basic inability to move attention and action away from the starting point of graphic productions. The present case study, contrasted with observations on other brain-damaged patients, demonstrates that allochiria may have different neuro-cognitive bases and offers new insights for theoretical interpretations of unilateral spatial neglect.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70143-6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Her bisections of horizontal lines were displaced significantly to the right of true centre. On drawing and copying tasks, she sometimes omitted features on the left (neglect) and sometimes transposed them to right space (allochiria). This co-occurrence of neglect and allochiria has been observed previously but has provoked little theoretical comment.

11968817,[A case of falcotentorial meningioma with visual allesthesia].,"Arai, Takao; Irie, Koreaki; Akiyama, Masahiko; Kamikubo, Takeshi; Nakajima, Masato; Sakai, Haruo; Abe, Toshiaki",Arai,"Visual allesthesia, in which visual images are transposed from one homonymous half-field of visual field to another, is a rare phenomenon. Palinopsia is the persistence or recurrence of visual images after the exciting stimulus object has been removed. Some authors have reported these phenomena, but these pathophysiology has not been understood. We report a right-handed 63-year-old woman, with a right falcotentorial meningioma. She paroxysmally experienced illusory transpositions of objects viewed in the right homonymous visual field into the left, and she recognized her face in it. The illusory images were palinoptic, persisting for up to a few minutes after the real objects were no longer in view. Administration of anticonvulsant medications resulted in the decrease of frequency of this phenomenon. Radiological and surgical findings revealed that the tumor was compressing the very localized visual cortex, especially the Brodmann's area 18 and 19. After resection of the tumor, visual allesthesia and palinopsia completely disappeared. These areas are associated with memory and recognition of visual images as visuopsychic area. This case provides some insight into the mechanisms of this phenomenon, and we consider that it could be caused by seizure activity in this lesion.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
6537247,Visual allesthesia in manual pointing: some evidence for a sensorimotor cerebral organization.,"Joanette, Y; Brouchon, M",Joanette,"The authors of this paper first summarize some of the theoretical frames put forward to account for allesthesia. Then, pointing performances in a case of visual allesthesia is reported; unexpectedly, pointing behavior for identical targets was different according to hand. The most salient feature was that a same visual target elicited relatively short RTs with adequate pointing using the left hand versus much longer reaction times with allesthesic pointing using the right hand. Discussion is focused on the presented theoretical frames. In view of the results, authors are led to hypothesize that, in sensorimotor cerebral organization, some aspects of signal processing are dependent upon some premotor aspects of response elaboration.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(84)90014-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
1799515,[A case of visual allesthesia].,"Nakajima, M; Yasue, M; Kaito, N; Kamikubo, T; Sakai, H",Nakajima,"A case of visual allesthesia is reported. A thirty-year-old right-handed man with a right temporo-occipital arteriovenous malformation underwent the surgery for extirpation of the lesion. Postoperatively he had left homonymous hemianopsia. Approximately 6 months after the surgery, he experienced the initial spell of generalized convulsion, followed by the episodes of visual allesthesia. He experienced illusory left hemonymous transpositions of objects viewed in the right homonymous field. The transposition occurred from normal to the defective visual field. The illusory image was palinoptic, persisting for up to several minutes after the real object was no longer in view. It was equal in shape with the original, and caused monocular diplopia. MRI showed a large area of postoperative changes. The lesion was located from the posterior half of the middle and inferior gyri of the right temporal lobe to the occipital and a part of the parietal cortex. And it extended into the right fusiform and lingual gyri. The right lateral geniculate body and the posterior part of thalamus were also involved. We speculated that this phenomenon may result from irritation of the affected brain and its surrounding areas, since the episode took place following the seizure.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
19062276,Phantom tactile sensations modulated by body position.,"Medina, Jared; Rapp, Brenda",Medina,"Bilateral activation of somatosensory areas after unilateral stimulation is assumed to be mediated by crosshemispheric connections. Despite evidence of bilateral activity in response to unilateral stimulation, neurologically intact humans do not experience bilateral percepts when stimulated on one side of the body. This may be due to active suppression of ipsilateral neural activity by inhibitory mechanisms whose functioning is poorly understood. We describe an individual with left fronto-parietal damage who experiences bilateral sensations in response to unilateral tactile stimulation-a rarely reported condition known as synchiria (previously described in visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities). Presumably, the phantom sensations result from normal bilateral crosshemispheric activation, combined with a failure of inhibitory mechanisms to prevent bilateral perceptual experiences. Disruption of these mechanisms provides a valuable opportunity to examine their internal functioning. We find that the synchiria rate is affected by hand position relative to multiple reference frames. Specifically, synchiria decreases as the hands move from right (contralesional) to left (ipsilesional) space in trunk- and head-centered reference frames and disappears when the hands are crossed. These findings provide novel evidence that mechanisms that inhibit bilateral percepts operate in multiple reference frames.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Current biology : CB,10.1016/j.cub.2008.10.068,PMC2701404,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",England,eng
15780455,Canceling out both the real and the spectral lines.,"Toraldo, Alessio; Gandola, Martina; Loffredo, Simona; Rancati, Anna; Zanardi, Gabriele; Bottini, Gabriella",Toraldo,"Neglect patients typically show motor perseveration while canceling targets on the ipsilesional side. This behavior can be influenced by the presence vs. absence of targets on the (neglected) contralesional side (). As alternative explanations, the authors proposed (i) directional hypokinesia--the patient cannot perform reaching movements towards detected left-sided targets, and thus carries on canceling on the right side, and (ii) allochiria--the patient misperceives left-sided targets as located on the right side, and cancels them there. We report here data from a patient (EZ) that might confirm the second hypothesis. EZ was presented with 19 displays in which the number and position of cancellation targets on both sides were varied systematically. EZ showed motor perseveration while canceling, but this tendency did not vary across conditions. Interestingly though, EZ also drew cancellation marks in the empty space between the ipsilesional targets, and this phenomenon was significantly more intense when there were more targets on the neglected side. As EZ's comments suggested, such a behavior might reflect the attempt to cancel out delusional targets. Our speculation is that those objects were generated by allochiria.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.051,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
9024194,False lateralization of seizure perceived by a patient with infarction of the right parietal lobe who showed the neglect syndrome.,"Heo, K; Kim, S J; Kim, J H; Kim, O K; Cho, H K",Heo,"A 66-year-old right-handed man developed seizures characterized by an electric sensation and convulsive movements involving the left arm, which sometimes secondarily generalized. The patient, however, reported that the seizures occurred in his right arm. Neurological examination showed many features of left hemineglect, including allesthesia, secondary to acute infarction of the right parietal lobe. Although allesthetic response was not documented during the seizure, it is likely that sensory symptoms of the seizures were localized inappropriately or that he had false memory for lateralization of seizures. In this case, the neglect syndrome caused by infarction of the right parietal lobe extended to symptoms of the seizure itself.",{},,Epilepsia,10.1111/j.1528-1157.1997.tb01087.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
2791414,"[""My hand"" sign associated with tactile extinction in two patients with callosal lesion].","Satomi, K; Kinoshita, Y; Goto, K; Sakai, N; Ito, H",Satomi,"Two patients with ""my hand"" sign in association with tactile extinction from callosal lesion, one due to left anterior cerebral artery occlusion, the other due to right anterior cerebral artery aneurysm rupture, were reported. The examination of ""my hand"" sign was performed with the methods proposed by Brion et al. Our patients correctly responded when they grasped their own or the examiner's thumb with their left hand. But they replied ""my finger""when they grasped not only their own but also the examiner's thumb with their right hand. Left tactile extinction was observed after a routine extinction test in one patient, and it was observed in the other after the following method: both patient's index fingers were disposed in his midline position. In these methods of extinction test, they made errors in saying ""right"" when both fingers were touched simultaneously. However, they said ""both"" when their right index finger alone was touched (synchiria) during an extinction test using the following method: both index fingers of patients were approached by examiner to touch each other or for one of them to touch the examiner's finger. When they were asked whose finger they touched in this method (whose finger test), they made the same errors as seen in ""my hand"" sign test. These test results suggest that there is a common underlying mechanism in the ""my hand"" sign and extinction, because the sense of double stimulations felt when only one stimulation is given (synchiria), is a possible explanation for the ""my hand"" sign and the pathogenesis of synchiria appears to be related to extinction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
