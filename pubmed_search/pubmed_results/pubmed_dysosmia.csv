34922127,Stellate ganglion block reduces symptoms of Long COVID: A case series.,"Liu, Luke D; Duricka, Deborah L",Liu,"After recovering from COVID-19, a significant proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals develop Long COVID. Fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, brain fog, anosmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia in Long COVID resemble ""sickness behavior,"" the autonomic nervous system response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (Dantzer et al., 2008). Aberrant network adaptation to sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance is expected to produce long-standing dysautonomia. Cervical sympathetic chain activity can be blocked with local anesthetic, allowing the regional autonomic nervous system to ""reboot."" In this case series, we successfully treated two Long COVID patients using stellate ganglion block, implicating dysautonomia in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and suggesting a novel treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuroimmunology,10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577784,PMC8653406,Cerebral blood flow; Dysautonomia; Long COVID/PASC; Myalgic encephalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS); Postural orthopedic tachycardia syndrome (POTS); Stellate ganglion block,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
36966620,Persistent prosopagnosia following COVID-19.,"Kieseler, Marie-Luise; Duchaine, Brad",Kieseler,"COVID-19 can cause psychological problems including loss of smell and taste, long-lasting memory, speech, and language impairments, and psychosis. Here, we provide the first report of prosopagnosia following symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Annie is a 28-year-old woman who had normal face recognition prior to contracting COVID-19 in March 2020. Two months later, she noticed face recognition difficulties while experiencing symptom relapses and her deficits with faces have persisted. On two tests of familiar face recognition and two tests of unfamiliar face recognition, Annie showed clear impairments. In contrast, she scored normally on tests assessing face detection, face identity perception, object recognition, scene recognition, and non-visual memory. Navigational deficits frequently co-occur with prosopagnosia, and Annie reports that her navigational abilities are substantially worse than before she became ill. Self-report survey data from 54 respondents with long COVID showed that a majority reported reductions in visual recognition and navigation abilities. In summary, Annie's results indicate that COVID-19 can produce severe and selective neuropsychological impairments similar to deficits seen following brain damage, and it appears that high-level visual impairments are not uncommon in people with long COVID.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.01.012,PMC9995301,COVID-19; Case study; Face blindness; Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC); Prosopagnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

We report a case of Wernicke encephalopathy in a young girl with poor oral intake secondary to anosmia and dysgeusia after a COVID-19 infection. After a recent infection of COVID-19, a 15-year-old girl developed an overwhelming noxious metallic tase resulting in a 30 lb weight loss from being unable to tolerate oral foods.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed an olfactory groove meningioma. The patient underwent a preterm cesarean section to avoid the worsening of the clinical condition due to intracranial compression phenomena. A computed tomography scan of the brain supported the diagnosis. The surgical intervention occurred on the third day after delivery. The clinical course was uneventful and the chiasmal syndrome improved in the following 2 months. Meningiomas in pregnancy may present unique challenges and have a wide array of clinical presentations. Management of maternal meningiomas can be complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Simpson grade I removal was rare in early reports due to their invasion of the ethmoid sinuses and skull base bone,1 which resulted in high recurrence rates.2,3 Indeed, recurrence occurred in the most celebrated case of olfactory groove meningioma.4,5  To achieve Simpson grade I removal (tumor, dura, bone), protect the frontal lobes from additional injury, and provide the best chance for recovery, we demonstrate a few nuances for olfactory groove meningioma surgery: Utilizing a skull base approach with a low dural opening, the frontal veins are preserved, and the frontal lobe is protected from retraction, manipulation, and venous injury. By the time of diagnosis, although the patient's olfaction is often absent, there still remains a role to preserve at least 1 olfactory tract, which might yield some preservation in a limited number of patients. Emphasis has been rightly made on the preservation of the A2 segments, which can be dissected using microsurgical technique. Lastly, multilayer reconstruction of the skull base is required, using an inlay graft, resting on a vascularized pericranial flap, and occlusion of the sinuses with a fat graft. The endonasal endoscopic approach has fallen out of favor due to limitations for complete tumor resection and higher complication rates.6  We present a case of a relatively small olfactory groove meningioma in a 36-yr-old male with partial olfactory loss.

SARS-CoV-2 mainly involves the respiratory system, however, with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), neurological and special senses clinical manifestations have been reported rarely. The present study aims to investigate the MRI findings, clinical manifestations of neurological and special senses involvement in SARS-CoV-2 patients. In this study, 284 articles from the databases ""Pub-Med, Web of Science-Clarivate Analytics, Embase and Google Scholar"" were identified. The keywords, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, MRI, brain, special senses, neurological involvement were entered into the search engines and the concerned documents were selected and reviewed. The descriptive information was recorded from the particular studies; finally, we included 48 publications. The common neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, tremors, meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhage, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and intracerebral hematoma, hemiparesis and seizures. However, common special senses manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 patients were olfactory, auditory and gustatory disorders including red eyes, painless monocular visual disturbance, anosmia, ageusia, dysgeusia, dysosmia and hypoacusis. Moreover, the MRI findings identified in SARS-CoV-2 patients were isolated oval-shaped lesion in the corpus callosum, bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhage, ischemic lesions involving the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, cerebellum and vasogenic edema extending to the cerebral peduncles, pons and ventricles. The neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 patients are highly variable. The SARS-COV-2 exerts its damaging effects on the nervous system and special senses by developing determinant numerous neurological and special senses' clinical manifestations.

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome or ataxia may also occur. Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebellum was excluded by normal cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and, most importantly, absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody production. Other causes of ataxia such as other viral infections, other autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic diseases or intoxication were ruled out. The neurological deficits improved rapidly after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. The laboratory and clinical findings as well as the marked improvement after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy suggest a post-infectious, immune-mediated cause of ataxia. This report should make clinicians aware to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential cause of post-infectious neurological deficits with an atypical clinical presentation and to consider high-dose corticosteroid treatment in case that a post-infectious immune-mediated mechanism is assumed.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC infectious diseases,10.1186/s12879-021-05987-y,PMC7988684,COVID-19; Case report; Post-infectious cerebellar ataxia; Post-infectious neurological disease; SARS-CoV-2 infection,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS. When finding atypical symptoms, a more in-depth evaluation should be made to allow optimization of the diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/s12888-021-03360-6,PMC8296673,Brain tumor; Case report; Charles-bonnet syndrome; Meningioma; Visual hallucinations,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Using an fMRI olfactory stimulus paradigm, this study compared BOLD activation of the brain in a 21-year old male research subject with post-traumatic anosmia and a 19-year old male normal healthy control participant. A delayed activation of the primary orbitofrontal cortex was found in the subject with traumatic anosmia, which may represent a crucial pathophysiological mechanism in the subject with traumatic anosmia due to axonal injury or traumatic transection at the lamina cribrosa level. In healthy subjects the activation of secondary cortical areas may be due to the habituation effect in the primary olfactory cortex. This raises the possibility that, in the absence of secondary activation areas-that may act as a feed-back habituation or desensitization in the patient-one of the primary response areas is activated over the longer period of stimulation. The failed activation of these secondary areas in the patient may cause a feed-back habituation or desensitization in the patient and could also play a role in the disturbed perception of odours.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2016.1199895,,Functional MRI; anosmia; olfactory pathways; post-traumatic anosmia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Several studies have reported the neuropathological examination of brain samples from patients who died from COVID-19. However, there is still sparse evidence of virus replication in the human brain, suggesting that neurologic symptoms could be related to mechanisms other than CNS infection by the virus. Our objective was to provide an extensive review of the literature on the neuropathological findings of postmortem brain samples from patients who died from COVID-19 and to report our own experience with 18 postmortem brain samples. We used microscopic examination, immunohistochemistry (using two different antibodies) and PCR-based techniques to describe the neuropathological findings and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in postmortem brain samples. For comparison, similar techniques (IHC and PCR) were applied to the lung tissue samples for each patient from our cohort. The systematic literature review was conducted from the beginning of the pandemic in 2019 until June 1st, 2022. In our cohort, the most common neuropathological findings were perivascular haemosiderin-laden macrophages and hypoxic-ischaemic changes in neurons, which were found in all cases (n = 18). Only one brain tissue sample harboured SARS-CoV-2 viral spike and nucleocapsid protein expression, while all brain cases harboured SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity by PCR. A colocalization immunohistochemistry study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 antigens could be located in brain perivascular macrophages. The literature review highlighted that the most frequent neuropathological findings were ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions, including hypoxic/ischaemic alterations. However, few studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in brain tissue samples. This study highlighted the lack of specific neuropathological alterations in COVID-19-infected patients.

The patient demonstrated profound impairments in odor identification and recognition. Moreover, he could not discriminate between olfactory stimuli, and he had severe impairments in odor detection. Reliable stimulus detection was obtained only for solutions of the organic solvent acetone and highly concentrated solutions of ethanol. In contrast to the more circumscribed olfactory deficits demonstrated in patients with damage confined to either the temporal lobes or orbitofrontal cortex (which tend to involve odor identification but not odor detection), Patient B. demonstrated a strikingly severe and complete anosmia.

Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19-triggered autoimmune necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. Collective data indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19-bearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19-infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19-triggered NAM is an overlooked entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation. Although COVID-19 infection, like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,10.1212/NXI.0000000000000781,PMC7309518,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Despite the paucity of fever and respiratory symptoms, they remain capable of infecting others. The patient we discuss herein highlights the important issues of strokes as presenting events of COVID-19 infections, and how testing for COVID-19 in stroke patients, even when asymptomatic for COVID-19, can play an important role in infection control, clinical management and outcomes amidst this global pandemic. A 45-year-old male resident of a dormitory presented to our unit with acute vertigo and left-sided dysmetria. NIHSS was 2. The initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, middle cerebellar peduncle and hemipons. An extensive work-up for stroke etiologies was unremarkable. Despite having no fever, respiratory symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, he was isolated and screened for COVID-19 due to his epidemiologic risks, with multiple residents from his dormitory being recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Confirming our suspicion, his respiratory samples returned positive for COVID-19. His D-dimer levels returned normal. Thereafter, the patient underwent posterior decompression surgery due to worsening edema caused by the cerebellar infarct. He was started on antiplatelet therapy and recovered significantly a month from presentation with an modified Rankin Sore of 2. He remained without typical COVID-19 symptoms. Our patient's case clearly supports the screening for COVID-19 in stroke patients who are without COVID-19 symptoms, appreciating the significant value it adds to infection control, clinical management, and outcomes amidst this global pandemic.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000305,PMC8041490,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Radiological studies revealed the existence of a large tumor mass with an extra-axial appearance and location in the anterior cranial fossa, initially compatible with a giant meningioma of the olfactory groove. Gross total resection of the mass was carried out. The pathological diagnosis was unexpected: a solitary fibrous tumor (WHO grade 1, 2021). Given the aggressive nature of these lesions, with a tendency to recurrence, malignant transformation and even metastasis, surgery with macroscopically complete resection intention should constitute the first therapeutic option.

This study describes a case of TBI-related anosmia. The olfactory function was evaluated by Sniffin' Sticks Test (SST), Olfactory Event-Related Potentials (OERPs), MRI and DTI at baseline (T0) and after one year (T1). At baseline, SST highlighted a functional anosmia. The OERPs showed the presence of a small N1-P2 complex. MRI confirmed the presence of a scarring involved in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). DTI detected a reduction in the average length and the number of neuronal fibre pathways of right OFC. At T1, a recovery of olfactory function was confirmed by SST and OERPs. While MRI images are unchanged from T0, DTI showed an increase in average length and number of fibre tracts in the right OFC.

Symptoms consist of fever, cough and breathing difficulties. An increasing number of studies are focusing on neurological manifestations. In addition to the typical ageusia and anosmia, up to 30% of cases can present headache, nausea and vomiting. More serious neurological manifestations, such as encephalitis, thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage have been reported. We described the case of a 47-year-old man who tested positive for COVID-19 virus in early March 2020. After two negative nasopharyngeal swabs, 41 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, he developed intense headache with fever, and he was hospitalized. He had subsequent generalized epileptic seizures and intubation was necessary. Contrast Head MRI was negative for brain abscesses or tumours but detected severe vasogenic oedema of the white matter with 10 mm shift of the midline and compression of the right lateral ventricle. Massive cortisone support therapy was ineffective. We diagnosed brain death on day 43 from the infection diagnosis. COVID-19 virus can reach the brain, penetrating into the neuronal cells through the interaction between the spike protein S1 and the host ACE-2 receptor, expressed in the capillary endothelium. We believe that in this infection, the pro-inflammatory state induced by the cytokine storm can cause a cerebral cell-mediated response, with subsequent vasodilatation and brain oedema. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a delayed onset cell-mediated encephalitis caused by COVID-19 virus after more than 40 days from the diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The International journal of neuroscience,10.1080/00207454.2021.1886095,,COVID-19; Encephalitis; fatal; infection,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Olfactory dysfunction is more likely to be overlooked by both the patient and the provider, especially in the acute setting, in contrast to deficits in other senses like vision or hearing. This is a retrospective clinical analysis (case series) of eight active duty service members referred to ear, nose, and throat clinic at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center during a 2-yr period between March 2014 and March 2016 for subspecialist evaluation of suspected olfactory impairment after an exposure to closed head trauma. Advanced neuroimaging revealed evidence of frontal lobe injury in all eight patients, which was subtle and subcentimeter in half of the cases, best demonstrated with high-resolution imaging in the coronal plane. In this article, we discuss the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and brain pathology in both TBI and non-TBI settings.

The understanding of the cortical areas involved in ability to detect, discriminate and identify the odours is still limited. However, it has been shown that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in the discrimination and recognition of odours and in particular the right OFC has a dominant role in the central processing of smell. This study used the Sniffin' Sticks Test to evaluate olfactory function of a 40-year-old female with persistent post-traumatic anosmia and to have a objective measure method for the follow-up. A marked decrease in the ability to identify and discriminate odours was found. On the other hand the ability to perceive the odours was little compromised. A cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging, performed 10 months after the trauma, showed the presence of a post-traumatic scarring in the right frontal lobe involving the OFC. In this case of post-traumatic anosmia, the ability to perceive and recognize odours does not seem to be compromised in the same measure. It is postulated that the post-traumatic outcomes, involving areas of multisensory integration such as the OFC, have an important pathogenetic role in the loss of ability to recognize and discriminate odours.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.823667,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Nevertheless, most studies focusing on the relationship between OD and TBIs do not differentiate between the different types of TBI (mild, medium, and severe). In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature for the association between mild TBI (mTBI) and OD in order to examine their relationship, focusing on its neurosurgical management and the radiographic characteristics. The MEDLINE database was systematically reviewed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. We found 66 articles, of which 10 fulfilled our criteria. All except two studies reported a significant association between trauma severity and olfaction. Two studies found a negative correlation between TBI severity and olfactory bulb volume with one reporting an r value of -0.62). Three studies reported an association between the observation of radiographic intracranial hemorrhage or skull base fractures and the history of TBI. According to our search results, we conclude that OD is a prevalent but underdiagnosed problem in mTBI. Because OD is associated with a significant decrease in quality of life, we think that neurosurgical teams need to asses olfactory function in mTBI patients when they report to clinics. To illustrate this scenario, we include two distinct cases of patients with anosmia after mTBI in this review. Finally, we suggest a treatment algorithm for patients with mTBI so that a possible OD can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/2152-7806.181981,PMC4866055,Anosmia; head trauma; olfactory dysfunction; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng

Anosmia, as well as dysgeusia, cannot be evaluated in patients of eTSS for a while after surgery. We report a case of an infundibular epidermoid cyst with post-eTSS Mollaret's meningitis (MM). The post-eTSS MM caused vasopressin-analogue-resistant polyuria (VARP) in synchronization with PPP. A 59-year-old man experiencing recurrent headaches and irregular bitemporal hemianopsia over three months was diagnosed with a suprasellar tumor. The suprasellar tumor was an infundibular cyst from the infundibular recess to the posterior lobe of the pituitary, which was gross-totally resected including the neurohypophysis via an extended eTSS. Since awakening from general anesthesia after the gross total resection (GTR) of the tumor, the patient continuously had suffered from headache until the 13<sup>th</sup> postoperative day (POD13). The patient took analgesics once a day before the surgery and three times a day after the surgery until POD11. Pyrexia (37.5-39.5 degree Celsius) in synchronization with nonnephrogenic VARP remitted on POD18. Intravenous antibiotics had little effect on changes of pyrexia. Serum procalcitonin values (reference range <0.5 ng/mL) are 0.07 ng/mL on POD12 and 0.06 ng/mL on POD18. His polyuria came to react with sublingual desmopressin after alleviation of pyrexia. He left the hospital under hormone replacement therapy without newly added neurological sequelae other than hypopituitarism. After GTR of an infundibular epidermoid cyst, based on values of serum procalcitonin, post-eTSS MM can be distinguished from infection and can be treated with symptomatic treatments. The postoperative transient nonnephrogenic VARP that differs from usual central diabetes insipidus can react with sublingual desmopressin after alleviation of PPP in the clinical course of post-eTSS MM. An infundibular epidermoid cyst should be sufficiently resected in one sitting to minimize comorbidities, its recurrence, or postoperative MM to the utmost.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2021/6690372,PMC8060105,,Case Reports,United States,eng

In this study, we aimed to discuss the prevalence of atypical and/or extrapulmonary manifestations in COVID-19, therefor action for early isolation and diagnosis can be initiated to prevent spread of infection. This retrospective observational study included 4200 admitted COVID-19 patients. The patient's data concerning medical history, clinical symptoms at presentation and during course of hospitalization, laboratory and radiological diagnosis and underlying chronic medical illness were extracted from their medical records. Data of extrapulmonary and/or atypical presentations of COVID-19 were compiled and tabulated to know prevalence of these manifestations. In this study, 1260 patients (30%) had symptomatic presentation. Major extrapulmonary clinical manifestation includes fatigue in 72.22% patients, impaired sense of taste (ageusia) in 58.73%, loss of appetite in 52.78%, impaired sense of smell (anosmia) in 46.83%, palpitation in 33.33%, headache in 33.17%, nausea/vomiting in 31.43%, diarrhoea in 25.40% patients. Among symptomatic COVID-19 patients, 95.56% patients had sinus tachycardia, 38.49% had lymphocytopenia, 36.83% had hepatitis, 35.48% had leukopenia, 27.83% had gastroenteritis, 22.22% had sepsis, 20.87% had proteinuria, 17.30% had coronary artery disease and 16.34% had acute kidney injury in decreasing order. Prevalence of coagulation defect associated disorder were found to be deep venous thrombosis in 15.56% patients, acute coronary syndrome in 7.78%, brain infarct in 6.35%, pulmonary artery thrombosis in 3.25% and SMA thrombosis in 0.32% of symptomatic patients. Patients of SARS-CoV-2 had widespread organ-specific manifestations with involvement of almost all organ system of body.

However, in some cases, these symptoms can be disabling and may affect quality of life. Anosmia was reported as a possible complication following head injury and neurosurgical procedures, particularly after the resection of tumors located in the anterior fossa and the treatment of aneurysms in the anterior circulation. Nonetheless, in all of these situations, olfactory dysfunction could be explained by damage to the peripheral olfactory system. Here, the authors report a case of complete anosmia associated with ageusia following awake resection of a low-grade glioma involving the left temporoinsular region, with no recovery during a follow-up of 3 years. The frontal lobe was not retracted, and the olfactory tract was not visualized during surgery; therefore, postoperative anosmia and ageusia are likely explained by damage to the cortex and central pathways responsible for these senses. The authors suggest that the patient might have had a subclinical right hemianosmia before surgery, which is a common condition. After resection of the central structures critical for smell and taste processing in the left hemisphere, the patient could have finally had bilateral and complete olfactory and gustatory loss. This is the first known report of permanent anosmia and ageusia following glioma surgery. Because these symptoms might have been underestimated, more attention should be devoted to olfaction and taste, especially with regard to possible subclinical preoperative deficit.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2012.2.JNS111982,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,General hospital psychiatry,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.05.008,PMC7242189,Akinetic mutism; COVID-19; Delirium; Encephalopathy; SARS-CoV-2,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, data on COVID-19-related encephalitis and movement disorders are still limited. Herein, we describe the clinical and neuroimaging (FDG-PET/CT, MRI and DaT-SPECT) findings of two patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy who developed prominent parkinsonism. None of the patients had previous history of parkinsonian signs/symptoms, and none had prodromal features of Parkinson's disease (hyposmia or RBD). Both developed a rapidly progressive form of atypical parkinsonism along with distinctive features suggestive of encephalitis. A possible immune-mediated etiology was suggested in Patient 2 by the presence of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, but none of the patients responded favorably to immunotherapy. Interestingly, FDG-PET/CT findings were similar in both cases and reminiscent of those observed in post-encephalitic parkinsonism, with cortical hypo-metabolism associated with hyper-metabolism in the brainstem, mesial temporal lobes, and basal ganglia. Patient's FDG-PET/CT findings were validated by performing a Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis and comparing the results with a cohort of healthy controls (n = 48). Cerebrum cortical thickness map was obtained in Patient 1 from MRI examinations to evaluate the structural correlates of the metabolic alterations detected with FDG-PET/CT. Hypermetabolic areas correlated with brain regions showing increased cortical thickness, suggesting their involvement during the inflammatory process. Overall, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger an encephalitis with prominent parkinsonism and distinctive brain metabolic alterations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-021-10560-3,PMC8059684,COVID-19; FDG-PET/CT; Neuroimaging; Neurological complications; Parkinsonism; Parkinson’s disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

However, skull base approaches facilitate their resection. We describe our experience with the extended subfrontal approach in treating tumours of the anterior cranial base. This approach was performed on 29 patients with large tumours of the anterior skull base. The final outcome in all 29 patients was favourable in terms of total resection of the tumour with minimal subsequent neurological deficit. Two patients developed transient oedema of the frontal lobes without persistent neurological sequelae. Another patient developed a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula that was successfully repaired. The patients were followed for a period ranging from 6 to 28 months. There was no recurrence. The operative technique is described. En bloc removal of the roofs of the orbits and part of the anterior cranial fossa permits wide exposure of the lesion with minimal brain retraction. Reconstruction of the anterior cranial base should be meticulous to avoid cerebrospinal fluid leaks and subsequent meningitis. Loss of smell is a sequel to this approach.

Twelve patients (five men, seven women; mean age 52 years) with olfactory meningiomas were examined. In all patients extensive preoperative and postoperative lateralised olfactory testing was performed using the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test battery, a psychometric testing tool. In eight cases the meningioma was lateralised (five left, three right), in four patients a bilateral meningioma was found. In addition to a detailed ear, nose, and throat examination MRI was performed in all patients. In preoperative testing six patients were found to be anosmic on the side of the tumour, two were hyposmic. Four patients were normosmic. Postoperative investigations showed lateralised anosmia in four patients on the operated side, three were normosmic on the contralateral side and one hyposmic. The remaining eight patients were completely anosmic postoperatively. (1) Contrary to expectations, olfactory testing seems to be of little help in detecting olfactory meningiomas.

The endonasal endoscopic approach was compared with the supraorbital (eyebrow) keyhole technique, as well as a combined ""above-and-below"" approach, to evaluate the relative merits of each approach in different situations. Nineteen cases were reviewed and divided according to operative technique into 3 different groups: purely endonasal (6 cases); supraorbital eyebrow (microscopic with endoscopic assistance; 7 cases); and combined endonasal endoscopic with either the bicoronal or eyebrow microscopic approach (6 cases). Resection was judged on postoperative MRI using volumetric analysis. Tumors were assessed based on the Mohr radiological classification and the presence of the lion's mane sign. The mean age at surgery was 61.4 years. The mean tumor volume was 19.6 cm(3) in the endonasal group, 33.5 cm(3) in the supraorbital group, and 37.8 cm(3) in the combined group. Significant frontal lobe edema was identified in 10 cases (52.6%). The majority of tumors were either Mohr Grade II (moderate) (42.1%) or Grade III (large) (47.4%). Gross-total resection was achieved in 50% of the endonasal cases, 100% of the supraorbital eyebrow cases with endoscopic assistance, and 66.7% of the combined cases. The extent of resection was 87.8% for the endonasal cases, 100% for the supraorbital eyebrow cases, and 98.9% for the combined cases. Postoperative anosmia occurred in 100% of the endonasal and combined cases and only 57.1% of the supraorbital eyebrow cases. Excluding anosmia, permanent complications occurred in 83.3% of the cases in the endoscopic group, 0% of the cases in the supraorbital eyebrow group, and 16.7% of cases in the combined group (p = 0.017). There were 3 tumor recurrences: 2 in the endonasal group and 1 in the combined group. The supraorbital eyebrow approach, with endoscopic assistance, leads to a higher extent of resection and lower rate of complications than the purely endonasal endoscopic approach.

Their malignant natural history is attributable to the higher predilection for retrograde cortical venous drainage. This video illustrates an e-dAVF in a 70-year-old man with progressive tinnitus and headache. Angiogram revealed bilateral e-dAVFs (Borden III-Cognard III) with one fistula draining into cavernous sinus and another to the sagittal sinus. A bifrontal craniotomy was utilized for venous interruption of both e-dAVFs. Postoperative angiography confirmed curative obliteration with no postoperative anosmia. Bilateral e-dAVFs are rare but can be safely treated simultaneously through a single craniotomy.The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/666edwKHGKc.,{},,Neurosurgical focus,10.3171/2019.2.FocusVid.18702,,bifrontal craniotomy; dural arteriovenous fistula; ethmoidal fistula; microsurgical clip ligation; video,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
16308262,Euosmia: a rare form of parosmia.,"Landis, B N; Frasnelli, J; Hummel, T",Landis,"The nature of qualitative olfactory disorders such as phantosmia and parosmia is a matter of debate. Parosmia and phantosmia mainly occur in combination with post-traumatic or post-infectious olfactory loss. Rare causes of these disorders such as brain tumors, side-effects of drugs, paraneoplastic syndromes, psychiatric disorders or intracerebral haemorrhage have been reported. Parosmias are distorted sensations of smell elicited by an odor, whereas phantosmias persist permanently or occur without the presence of an odor source. Phantosmias differ widely in terms of their nature. In contrast, parosmias always seem to be unpleasant. We report the case of a female with post-infectious hyposmia who reported a pleasant parosmia to selected odorants.

It rarely extends intracranially. We report a clinical case of olfactory neuroblastoma with intracranial extension and distant metastasis. A 35-year-old man complained of nasal stuffiness and bleeding, headache and vomiting. Neurological examination showed anosmia and papilledema. MRI showed a huge mass that occupied the right nasal and paranasal cavities, and extended into the right frontal base. The tumor was removed totally and was histologically diagnosed as olfactory neuroblastoma. About two months after surgery, however, MRI demonstrated a rapid recurrence of the tumor in the nasal and paranasal cavities and the frontal lobe. Metastatic lesions were also seen in the right cervical lymph nodes. Chemotherapy was administered using cisplatin and etoposide. The tumor in the frontal lobe shrunk markedly but the other lesion persisted. Whole brain irradiation and local irradiation of the cervical lymph nodes were performed. The tumors became smaller but did not disappear. MRI demonstrated spinal dissemination. Irradiation of the whole spinal cord was performed. The metastatic lesions disappeared. The patient was discharged without neurological deficits, but died of pneumonia 15 months after surgery. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a slow-growing tumor and is highly radiosensitive, but it rarely extends or develops multiple distant metastases and seldom shows a short survival time, as in our case.

Neurological examination revealed anosmia, papilledema, decrease in visual acuity, and disability in ocular movement. MRI showed a huge mass which occupied the whole nasal cavity and compressed the frontal lobe upwards and the eyes laterally. CT revealed an extensive bony destruction of the frontal base and bilateral orbits. The mass was biopsied transnasally, and was histologically diagnosed as olfactory neuroblastoma. It was highly radiosensitive and disappeared with a local irradiation of 40 Gy. Three months later the patient complained of a pain radiating from the neck to the right arm. MRI demonstrated a metastasis at the vertebral body of C5. Local irradiation of 30 Gy was performed. The metastatic lesion was removed, and a bone graft taken from the iliac bone was transplanted via an anterior cervical approach. Three weeks later, however, a hard mass appeared in the right of his neck and was surgically removed. By histological examination, it was also identified as a metastatic neuroblastoma to the cervical lymph node. A week after the removal of the cervical metastatic lesion, the metastasis extended rapidly to the left cervical and the bilateral hilar lymph nodes of the lungs. Chemotherapy was performed with a total doses of 800mg of cyclophosphamide, 1.5mg of vincristine, 40mg of pirarubicin, and 80mg of cisplatin. The lesions disappeared within 7 days.

Olfactory neuroblastoma is usually an intranasal neoplasm, but it rarely extends intracranially and intraorbitally as is shown in our case. Basically, olfactory neuroblastoma is a relatively slow-growing tumor though it has a tendency to develop local recurrences over long periods even after aggressive primary treatment, and accompanied with distant metastases.

We present the case of a 50-year-old male with SSCN accompanied by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss which gradually progressed to total deafness over a seven year period. This patient also had associated bilateral caloric weakness with episodes of severe recurrent headaches over the two preceding years. The deafness and gait disturbance, which were his chief complaints, were followed by other neurological manifestations including pyramidal tract signs, anosmia, and ageusia.

Low signal intensity along the proximal segment of the acoustic nerve and the facial nerve was noted from the cistern to the internal auditory canal. Neither bilateral transtympanic promontory nor round window electrical stimulation elicited any sound sensation. In this case it was thought that the acoustic nerve alone or both the acoustic nerve and the cochlea were affected by this disease. Consequently, cochlear implantation was not indicated.

By angiography we failed to demonstrate a cause of the hemorrhage, but the presence of a cryptic angioma was suggested, because the post angiographic CT scan exhibited enhancement of the lesion. Her olfactory sensation was also restored accompanied with the recovery of the superficial sensation, therefore the hyposmia seemed to be due to the damage of the trigeminothalamic tract.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
10748854,Reversible hyposmia caused by intracranial tumour.,"Ishimaru, T; Miwa, T; Nomura, M; Iwato, M; Furukawa, M",Ishimaru,"Two patients with hyposmia caused by an intracranial tumour recovered olfactory functions after craniotomy. The first case was a 68-year-old male with a tumour metastasized from the lung to the right frontal lobe. The second case was a 75-year-old male with meningioma of the right frontal lobe. Results of T & T olfactometry and venous olfaction tests also indicated suspected central hyposmia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated compression of the frontal lobe by intracranial tumour. Pressure on the olfactory centre located in the frontal lobe produced hyposmia. Decompression of the frontal lobe by craniotomy improved the sense of smell. Therefore, some cases of olfactory disturbance caused by intracranial tumour may be reversible if they are the result of simple compression of the olfactory centre.",{},,The Journal of laryngology and otology,10.1017/s0022215100145104,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
17491344,[Delayed brain abscess after penetrating transorbital injury].,"Hiraishi, Tetsuya; Tomikawa, Masaru; Kobayashi, Tsutomu; Kawaguchi, Tadashi",Hiraishi,"We report a case of brain abscess caused by a penetrating head injury that occurred 9 years earlier. A 14-year-old girl presenting with fever, headache, and stiff neck was admitted to our hospital. She was diagnosed with aseptic meningitis and treated conservatively. Seven days after admission she became stuporous and showed left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed two ring-enhancing masses with perifocal edema in the right frontal lobe. We diagnosed brain abscess and performed right fronto-temporal decompressive craniectomy and stereotactic aspiration, followed by systemic antibiotic therapy. Post-surgery bone window CT revealed a well-defined, low-density foreign body passing from the left orbita to the right frontal lobe through the ethmoid sinus. We learned that the patient had been struck with a plastic chopstick in the left medial eyelid at the age of 5 years. No particular symptoms developed during the following 9 years. After the cerebral edema had diminished over the next 10 days, a second surgery was performed to remove the residual chopstick, repair the fistula at the base of the skull, and perform cranioplasty. The patient was discharged with only slight hyposmia after a 4-week course of antibiotics. This case showed that it is necessary to remove a residual foreign body and to close the dural fistula if there is a possibility of recurrent central nervous system infection. When a child presents with brain abscess, previous penetrating head injury should be considered.",{},,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
7529370,Pituitary adenoma invading the skull base--a strategy for skull base surgery.,"Nakase, H; Ohnishi, H; Touho, H; Takaoka, M; Karasawa, J; Kawaguchi, M; Sakamoto, T",Nakase,"A strategy for surgical management, including the approach and preoperative evaluation, of pituitary adenoma invading the skull base is described. Preoperative evaluation requires a balloon occlusion test of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to determine tolerance to occlusion. Failure to tolerate occlusion indicates administration of brain protective agents and/or a bypass procedure before tumor removal. The transsphenoidal, pterional, orbitofrontomalar, and infratemporal fossa approaches are all suitable for various tumor locations. A combined orbitofrontomalar and extended frontal approach allows removal of tumor with extensive invasion and is suitable for bypass procedures. Preoperative evaluation of ICA occlusion can prevent development of hemodynamic stroke. We treated five patients with pituitary adenoma invading the skull base, including two primary and three recurrent cases. All symptoms improved, but temporary oculomotor nerve disturbance occurred in three patients and anosmia in one. Reoperations for recurrent pituitary adenomas were effective in reversing the symptoms. No hemodynamic stroke was seen postoperatively. These tumors, except for drug-responsive cases, are indicated for skull base surgery.",{},,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.34.686,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

Rarely these neoplasms will demonstrate a more aggressive behavior with extracranial extension and symptoms of upper airway obstruction or anosmia. Several reported cases suggest that although these neoplasms behave aggressively the overall survival and prognosis for these patients remains good. We present the clinical and postmortem findings of an occult invasive pituitary adenoma leading to the development of bacterial meningitis, coma and death. This communication stresses the necessity for the early diagnosis and treatment of the invasive adenomata to prevent the development of potentially fatal infectious sequelae.",{},,Clinical neuropathology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Clinical findings included papilledema in the right eye and optic atrophy in the left eye. A diagnosis of Foster Kennedy syndrome was made. Careful attention to the ophthalmoscopic appearance of the left eye disclosed optic disk swelling in regions without significant atrophy as well as dilated retinal veins. Both of these signs suggested increased intracranial pressure, rather than a primary anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. High resolution computed tomographic scanning confirmed the presence of a large subfrontal meningioma and an expanded right optic nerve sheath, consistent with the papilledema noted clinically.",{},,American journal of ophthalmology,10.1016/0002-9394(82)90532-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
6449061,"[Data concerning a case of long-term, asymptomatic, calcified cerebral tumor with late evolution of olfactory meningioma].","Ionel, C; Colea, A; Miloşescu, P",Ionel,"In a lot of 3 patients with olfactory meningioma, one patient drew particular attention by the particularities of its evolution, which was asymptomatic for a long time and atypical. The disease started at the age of 38 with asthenia, headaches, dizziness and X-ray images of left parasellar calcified brain tumour, without neurological signs of a focus at any of the repeated clinical or paraclinical examinations. After eight years focal signs appears: left pyramidal irritation, absences, left hyposmia, without altered visual acuity or conclusive scintigraphic and EEG alterations. Left carotid arteriography indicated a space-occupying process. The disease progressed slowly with left hemiparesis and corresponding effects. A diagnosis of ""left olfactory meningioma"" was established in the Neurosurgical Clinic, Bucharest. The situation deteriorated in 1977: total left anosmia, Jacksonian seizures, sometimes generalized, uncinate fits, paroxysmal headaches, amnesia disturbances and marked right hemiparesis. Recent scintigraphic and EEG alterations likewise lent support to a diagnosis of brain tumour. The existence of calcified, asymptomatic, trailing brain tumours, with an atypical and late evolution of unilateral olfactory meningioma, without Foster-Kennedy syndrome, demands from the beginning close surveillance and complex investigations, since a prolonged absence of anosmia and focal phenomena does not exclude the possibility of a meningioma of the olfactory groove, and may often lead to errors of diagnosis.",{},,"Revista de chirurgie, oncologie, radiologie, o.r.l., oftalmologie, stomatologie.

1238924,[Giant anterior communicating artery aneurysm (author's transl)].,"Ito, H; Shima, T; Yamamoto, S",Ito,"A case of giant aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery, 24 X 28 X 30 mm in diameter was found in a 30 year old man. About ten years ago he became blind and recently developed right anosmia and diencephalic seizures. No subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, was found. Radiograms and tomograms of the cranium showed a ring-like calcification, but by angiography it couldn't be recognized as a giant aneurysm. The right frontal craniotomy and partial resection, therefore, was performed. A histological study of the resected material revealed that it was a spontaneously thrombosed giant aneurysm. The inner layer of its wall had neither endothelium nor elastic lamina, but had deposits of calcium salt. The outer layer was composed of collagen fibers without cell infiltration. The aneurysm was thrombosed except for its neck but its organization occurred incompletely. We want to emphasize the importance of a correct preoperative diagnosis, as an erroneous operative procedure can result in disaster. Volume, viscosity and tension of flowing blood into the aneurysm as well as the size of its neck and dome regulate dynamic properties. These properties may determine the enlargement rate or growth of the aneurysm. The dynamic characteristics and features of the inner surface of the aneurysmal wall may regulate the formation of thrombosis in the aneurysm. The intraluminal thrombosis and strength of aneurysmal wall, for example, calcium deposits, may prohibit aneurysm from its rupture.",{},,No shinkei geka.

He was diagnosed the left olfactory groove meningioma and received the removal of the tumor after ligation of the left external carotid artery. Over the following two years he was admitted again with progressive memory disturbance and mental disorder in Aug. '73. Physical examination disclosed no abnormalities except for slight hypertention. His CSF pressure was 120 mm H2O and pneumoencephalograms showed marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles. Right carotid angiography revealed the right olfactory groove meningioma which was receiving a rich circulation from the branches of right ophthalmic artery. And right selective external arteriography showed an arteriovenous communication between the occipital artery and the transverse sinus. Contrast medium flowed to the left transverse sinus. Left internal carotid arteriography showed an anomalous arteriovenous communication between the tentorial branch (Bernasconi-Cassinari artery) of the internal carotid artery and sigmoid sinus. Further left vertebral arteriography revealed another arteriovenous communication between the left occipital artery anastomosed with vertebral artery and the transverse sinus. An operation for the right olfactory groove meningioma was made in Sep. '73.

She first noticed left facial hypesthesia followed by left visual disturbance with exophthalmos. CT scan showed an enhanced mass extending from the left cavernous sinus to the left orbit. Cranial x-ray revealed bone deformity around the orbit. The tumor was subtotally resected and its histological type was shown to be anaplastic meningioma. After the initial surgery the patient was left with hyposmia, mild ptosis and incomplete 6th cranial nerve palsy on the left side. After one and half years, not only palsy of those cranial nerves but also that of other unilateral cranial nerves became progressively apparent due to tumor regrowth. In total, 11 nerves (2nd-12th) were affected by the tumor, without long tract signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Radiation therapy carried out after the 2nd surgery was extremely effective and resulted in the recovery of lower cranial nerve function. The tumor was founded to have disappeared completely on the 2-year follow-up CT.",{},,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Main neurological symptoms were anosmia, sensorineural deafness, dysarthria, ataxia, and pyramidal tract signs. Lumbar puncture revealed bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in both cases. In case 1, the CSF became watery clear after administration of hemostatic medicines. T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed cerebellar atrophy and marginal hypointensity of the brainstem, cerebellum, and the entire spinal cord. T2-weighted images of the cranial nerves showed hypointensity of the VIII nerves which were clinically impaired as compared with normointensity of the VII nerves which presented no clinical symptom. These findings may reflect difference in the degree of hemosiderin depostion between the VII and VIII nerves. While case 1 had a borderline score of WAIS-R (IQ79), case 2 showed overt dementia (performance IQ65).

A 63-year-old right-handed woman began to exhibit a cerebellar ataxia when she was 52 years old. Thereafter she has been exhibiting a slowly progressive course of pyramidal signs, hearing loss, anosmia, bilateral sciatica and memory disturbance in addition to the cerebellar ataxia. Series of x-ray CT and MRI disclosed a progressive atrophy of the cerebellum, specifically in the superior vermis, and a mild diffuse atrophy in the cerebral hemispheres, whereas no significant atrophy was seen in the brainstem. A marked hypointensity was seen along the rim of the brain structures including brainstem, cerebellum, sylvian fissures and the medial temporal lobes on MR T 2-weighted images. This hypointensity was also found at the edges of the third and fourth ventricles. These findings were regarded as haemosiderin deposit. By using oxygen-15, PET was carried out repeatedly with ten-year interval. In the initial PET study, both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were mildly decreased in the cerebellar hemispheres and the occipital cortices. The follow-up PET study revealed a progressive reduction of CMRO2 in the brainstem, cerebellar hemispheres and temporal cortices including the hippocampus in which the haemosiderin deposition was marked on MRI, whereas the reduction of CBF was not advanced as compared with CMRO2. It was suggested that the progressive reduction of CMRO2 in the brain sites where the haemosiderin deposition was observed on MRI reflected the clinical course of neurological deterioration.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
