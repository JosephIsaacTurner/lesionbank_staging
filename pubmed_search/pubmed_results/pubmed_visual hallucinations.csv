35145781,Hypocalcemia-Induced Reversible Psychosis.,"Hall, Andrea; Bin Farooq, Talha; Alcaraz, Renato",Hall,"Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.20874,PMC8805771,delusions; hypoparathyroidism; metabolic psychosis; reversible; s: hypocalcemia,Case Reports,United States,eng

The patient described her auditory hallucinations as non-commanding voices talking to her about her family, her visual hallucinations as seeing ""shadows and shapes,"" and her paranoid delusions as people coming after her. The patient had sustained a fall a week and a half earlier, requiring eight sutures to her posterior scalp. Her MRI of the brain showed a well-circumscribed 3.5 x 4.7 x 3.2 cm mass in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. Computer tomography of the brain showed a 4.5 cm mass near the anterior interhemispheric fissure and edema in the right frontal cortex. Meningioma resection resulted in the cessation of hallucinations and delusions for one week. However, the patient was brought back to the emergency department because her auditory hallucinations and delusions returned. This case report demonstrates residual psychosis, even after frontal meningioma resection.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Health psychology research,10.52965/001c.27359,PMC8567796,auditory hallucinations; meningiomas; psychosis; visual hallucinations,Case Reports,United States,eng

No previously described case matched our peculiar symptom presentation in combination with the described brain lesions. Especially, the visual phenomena of patients with these brain lesions that were up until now described in literature were complex and vivid visual hallucinations. Here, we discuss possible explanations and mechanisms of this visual phenomenon (acquired hemidyschromatopsia, peduncular hallucinosis, focal epilepsy with visual symptoms, visual hallucinations) and in light of the current literature, we argue that the most likely explanation is a form of simple visual hallucination due to release phenomena (Charles Bonnet syndrome).","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000521815,PMC8958620,Case report; Charles bonnet syndrome; Ischemic stroke; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Visual cortex; Visual hallucinations,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

34408953,Zonisamide-Induced Hallucinations: An Anticonvulsant's Psychosis.,"Al Armashi, Abdul Rahman; Balozian, Patil; Somoza-Cano, Francisco J; Patell, Kanchi; Ravakhah, Keyvan",Al Armashi,"Zonisamide is a new-generation anticonvulsant that works by altering the sodium and T-type calcium channels in the brain. It is currently approved for partial seizures, and trials are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness against mania and chronic pain in adults. Psychosis is a rare side effect with an incidence of 2%. Our patient, a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of osteoarthritis and chronic pain only relieved by zonisamide is brought to the emergency department (ED) after a two-day history of altered mental status, agitation and visual hallucinations. One month prior, she had undergone total knee arthroplasty complicated with right knee cellulitis managed by IV (intravenous) long-term antibiotics of vancomycin and ertapenem. Physical examination was remarkable for disorientation to person, place, and time with intact remainder of the neurological exam. Initial laboratory work was unremarkable and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient was treated as ertapenem-induced with altered mental status and the antibiotic was switched to meropenem upon discharge. Two weeks later, the patient presented to the ED with similar non-resolving complaints. As the patient's symptoms didn't improve after ertapenem discontinuation, the decision was made to stop zonisamide and carefully monitor for possible withdrawal symptoms. Progressively, our patient had a timely resolution of symptoms with a full return to baseline within a week. This case demonstrates the potential severity of zonisamide-induced psychosis. Additional studies are warranted to analyze the mechanism explaining its neurological side effect profile.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.16400,PMC8363161,altered mental status; anti-epileptic drug; anticonvulsant; encephalopathy; hallucinations; neurological complication; neurological manifestations; partial seizure; psychosis; zonisamide,Case Reports,United States,eng
35774701,An Unusual Presentation of Vivid Hallucinations.,"Degueure, Arielle; Fontenot, Andee; Husan, Ammar; Khan, Muhammad W",Degueure,"Visual hallucinations may present secondary to neurologic, psychologic, or physiologic disturbances. Certain features and characteristics of visual hallucination are often attributed to various brain regions; however, with a broad list of causes and multifaceted pathophysiology, it is often hard to accurately localize. Overlapping clinical presentations may be due to the pathology of brain interconnections, rather than isolated brain regions themselves. In this study, we discuss a case of isolated, complex visual hallucinations secondary to occipital seizures in the radiologic absence of an ischemic injury. We propose that a network-based localizing lesion is responsible for this unconventional presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.25441,PMC9237857,charles bonnet syndrome; epilepsy; hallucinations; occipital; peduncular hallucinosis; seizures; visual cortex,Case Reports,United States,eng
33654605,Charles Bonnet Syndrome as Another Cause of Visual Hallucinations.,"Voit, MaryKate; Jerusik, Brian; Chu, Justin",Voit,"Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) presents as gradual vision loss and associated visual hallucinations in a patient who is otherwise neurologically and psychiatrically intact. This syndrome presents primarily as ophthalmologic disease, however, may be secondary to an ischemic stroke or tumor in the occipital lobe. Patients present with a complaint of vivid visual hallucinations ranging from spots and geometric shapes to seeing people, distorted figures and landscapes.First noted in the 1760s, CBS did not reach the western scientific community until the early 1980s. Our patient reported seeing her dog and deceased mother only when looking left. She was having an experience of phantom images in addition to a visual field impairment but was otherwise of sound mind with no gross neurological deficits. Computer topography of the brain revealed a subacute infarct in the right posterior occipital lobe. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with CBS following magnetic resonance imaging and ophthalmology consultation at tertiary center. Diagnosis may be delayed by lack of symptom reporting as patients do not want to carry a stigma as 'crazy.' Further, physician awareness of this etiology is low and a better understanding of the disease will prevent missed diagnosis as well as lack of appropriate consultation and follow-up. Treatment includes close outpatient ophthalmology care, maximizing existing vision and lifestyle changes including adjustments in lighting, decreasing stress and increasing socialization. Trials of prescription treatment (i.e., antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antiepileptics) have shown only anecdotal evidence at efficacy. CBS is an uncommon presentation of cerebral vascular disease that warrants the attention of emergency department physicians.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.12922,PMC7906273,case report; cerebral vascular accident; hallucinations; occipital lobe infarct; stroke; visual hallucination,Case Reports,United States,eng

33986011,Peduncular hallucinosis after a thalamic stroke.,"Shahab, Mohammad; Ahmed, Rashid; Kaur, Navreet; Masoud, Hesham",Shahab,"Peduncular hallucinosis is a rare form of hallucinations consisting of vivid and nonthreatening colourful visual hallucinations. It was first described by French neurologist Jean Lhermitte in 1922. It sometimes includes distorted images of animals and people. Peduncular hallucinosis has been described after vascular and infective lesions of the mesencephalon and thalamus.We present a case of peduncular hallucinosis after a right thalamic infarction. This is a case of a 75-year-old Caucasian man with a previous medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia who presented as a transfer from an outside hospital with transient left facial palsy, upper and lower extremity weakness. His symptoms resolved on arrival. CTA head and neck revealed focal filling defect in the basilar artery and a right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion at its origin. MRI brain without contrast revealed a right thalamic infarct. The patient had vivid hallucinations including his wife sleeping on his hospital bed, seeing his favourite book on the table while he had left it at home, seeing his dogs and a TV show on his room television while it was off. He was easily redirectable, and the hallucinations resolved over 2 days without pharmacological intervention. In cases of thalamic, midbrain or peduncular infarctions, physicians should be cognizant of the possibility of peduncular hallucinosis and inquire about hallucinations. New onset hallucinations in a patient with no prior psychiatric history presenting with concerns for stroke should prompt physicians to strongly consider peduncular hallucinosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2021-241652,PMC8126318,neuroimaging; neurology; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Visual hallucinations are often associated with dementia, eye disease, visual pathway disease, psychiatric disorders, delirium, migraines, ictal phenomena, or medication effects. We report a case of a 74-year-old woman with a previous cerebrovascular accident(CVA) without residual deficit and no previous psychiatric history presenting for one week of worsening hallucinations progressing from shapes to cats to human figures in the left visual field. She had no focal neurologic deficits nor visual field defects detected on physical exam. CT head without intravenous(IV) contrast demonstrated a nonspecific hypodensity in the right parieto-occipital region. MRI brain with and without IV contrast confirmed an acute stroke. Patient was admitted for risk factor modification and secondary prevention. She continues to have infrequent hallucinations of floating hands and fingers at follow-up appointment 2 weeks after the initial presentation to the Emergency Department.

34294066,Atypical Charles Bonnet syndrome secondary to frontal meningioma: a case report.,"Diana, Lomelín-López; Carmona-Huerta, Jaime; Patiño, J Guillermo; Alejandro, Aldana-López; Sol, Durand-Arias",Diana,"Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a rare clinical entity that is classically composed of visual hallucinations in the context of an altered optic pathway with preservation of reality judgment. This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS. When finding atypical symptoms, a more in-depth evaluation should be made to allow optimization of the diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/s12888-021-03360-6,PMC8296673,Brain tumor; Case report; Charles-bonnet syndrome; Meningioma; Visual hallucinations,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The objective of this case report is to elucidate the presentation of a patient with GS and to highlight the interplay of psychological and organic determinants in this condition. We present a 66-year-old man with a history of concussion and short-term memory loss who presented with selective, remote, and recent memory loss following the death of his wife, visual hallucinations, approximation of answers regarding his current state, and limited insight into his condition. We found the patient oriented only to place and person, with impaired short-term memory and no language abnormalities. Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) exam showed mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. The patient's presentation can be explained by both psychological and organic causes. Negative results from imaging and testing showed that the patient's recent emotional stressor, the death of his wife, may be contributing to the current state. However, the patient also has a history of hospitalization for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a recent history of progressive memory loss. Therefore, the combination of psychological and organic factors likely played supplementary roles in the patient's current presentation. This case supports the literature that GS is a psychogenic disorder. However, an organic cause from the long-term sequelae of TBI needs further exploration.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.10144,PMC7526759,approximate answer; dissociative disorder; ganser syndrome; organic; psychogenic,Case Reports,United States,eng

35747055,Autoimmune Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Limbic Encephalitis With Auditory and Visual Hallucinations.,"Srichawla, Bahadar S",Srichawla,"The limbic system (LS) coordinates an important role in memory generation, creating an emotional response to stress, and helping regulate autonomic and endocrine functions. Dysfunction of the limbic system can present secondary to many pathologies including autoimmune, infectious, paraneoplastic, etc. Lesions to the limbic system can also lead to varying symptoms which can be challenging for physicians to correctly identify and treat. Here we report a 59-year-old male with aggressive mood changes and acute onset of auditory and visual hallucinations. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum immunological antibody panel confirmed the presence of voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies. Significant radiographic findings included an MRI revealing T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral hippocampus. Paraneoplastic screening with testicular ultrasound and chest CT was completed and was negative. A primary diagnosis of voltage-gated potassium channel limbic encephalitis (VGKC-LE) was made. Management included five days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with subsequent resolution of symptoms. The limbic system is an intricate network of neurons that generates and relays key information to other parts of the brain. Its function and, in this case, its dysfunction remain an area of continued research.

A 54-year-old, right-handed woman presented with Lilliputian visual hallucinations, postprandial abdominal pain, blurred vision and headaches. She then had a tonic-clonic seizure. Neuroimaging revealed characteristic white matter oedema of the occipital lobes, in keeping with PRES. Renal infarcts and abnormalities of the abdominal aorta, subclavian, mesenteric, and internal carotid arteries were demonstrated on further imaging. The combination of hypertension, absent peripheral pulses, postprandial claudication, and imaging abnormalities of the aorta as well as its branches, lead to the diagnosis of PRES secondary to Takayasu's Arteritis. Treatment with oral steroids resulted in complete resolution of the patient's symptoms and abnormalities found on CT and MRI brain imaging. Takayasu's Arteritis is a rare vasculitis, more common in women and PRES is an unusual complication. Symptoms of PRES may include headache, seizures, hallucinations, confusion, and altered consciousness. Risk factors for PRES include; pregnancy, immunosuppression, renal disease, hypertension and rheumatological disorders. Vasogenic oedema in affected lobes, most often occipital, is characteristic of PRES on neuroimaging. Prompt treatment of PRES can avoid catastrophic consequences such as death and can achieve complete resolution of symptoms and imaging abnormalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2020.07.080,PMC7452015,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Takayasu's arteritis,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

The presenting features of an acute stroke depends on the area of the brain affected. Although unusual, the presenting feature may include psychosis with auditory and/or visual hallucinations. A 56-year-old female was admitted to the psychiatric unit after threatening her husband with a knife. She reported experiencing altered sensorium for one week with suicidal and homicidal command hallucinations. Given the acute onset, brain images were obtained to rule out an organic etiology. A brain MRI revealed an acute right occipital lobe infarct with hemorrhagic transformation. The patient's symptoms were self-limited, resolving without antipsychotic medications. Psychosis with auditory hallucinations is not commonly reported following stroke. Since histologic and functional alterations in the occipital lobe appear to play a significant role in psychosis of schizophrenics, it is likely that ischemia in the same area may cause similar changes. Familiarity with this rare presentation is important, as it prevents a delay in diagnosis, which may negatively impact the outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2018/1243605,PMC6040285,,Case Reports,United States,eng

They work in inflammatory sites as well as circulate in the blood. Cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid have been suggested to be markers of autoimmune encephalitis and reflect disease progression. However, studies on blood cytokines in autoimmune encephalitis are scarce. We report a case presenting with serial changes in blood cytokine levels in a male patient with anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (Caspr2) encephalitis. A 61-year-old man without systemic disease presented with ataxia and speech disturbance 1 week. After admission, he further developed visual hallucinations, psychosis, and consciousness deterioration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and infection and tumor surveillances were negative. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography of brain revealed frontal and occipital hypometabolism and anterior cingulate gyrus and mesial temporal hypermetabolism. Autoimmune studies confirmed Caspr2 antibodies in his blood. After receiving a diagnosis of anti-Caspr2 encephalitis, the patient received steroids, plasmapheresis, and zonisamide. He recovered well and was totally independent 6 months after disease onset. A cytokine profiler array kit was used to investigate neuroimmune mechanisms during the disease course. Several cytokines showed significant changes in plasma levels, such as B cell activating factor for B cell proliferation; thymus and activation-regulated chemokine for T cell chemoattraction; soluble CD40 ligand for Th2 cell mediation; C5/C5a for complement activation; brain-derived neurotrophic factor for neuronal survival response; and dipeptidyl peptidase 4, retinol binding protein, dickkopf-related protein, and epidermal growth factor for response to environmental provocation. The concentration of cytokines was verified using Luminex multiplexing assay. Due to their easy accessibility, blood cytokines are potential biomarkers of autoimmune encephalitis.

Three cases of CVH in the setting of pontine infarction, thalamic infarction and temporoparietal epileptiform activity are presented and the available psychiatric, neurological and biological literature on the structures of the central nervous system involved in producing hallucinatory states is reviewed. Complex visual hallucinations can arise from a variety of processes involving the retinogeniculocalcarine tract, or ascending brainstem modulatory structures. The cortical activity responsible for hallucinations results from altered or reduced input into these regions, or a loss of ascending inhibition of their afferent pathways. A significant degree of overlaps exists between the concepts of Charles Bonnet syndrome and peduncular hallucinosis. The fluidity of these eponymous syndromes reduces their validity and meaning, and may result in an inappropriate attribution of the underlying pathology.

It has been described as a sequelae of ischemic stroke affecting the visual pathway. We report a case of a male presenting with right homonymous hemianopsia secondary to acute left occipital lobe infarct of cardioembolic etiology. He then developed visual hallucinations on the side of the visual loss. MRI showed hemorrhagic conversion of the occipital lobe infarct. Electroencephalogram showed focal and intermittent slowing of the anterior temporal and frontal region. Charles Bonnet syndrome may signify the worsening or progression of a structural lesion affecting the visual pathway, such as hemorrhagic conversion, and warrants prompt and thorough evaluation. Understanding these conditions is crucial for healthcare professionals and caregivers to provide effective support and interventions for those affected.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.50472,PMC10786581,charles bonnet syndrome; hemorrhagic infarct; neuroophthalmology; neuropsychiatry; visual hallucination,Case Reports,United States,eng

29781583,Altered white matter connectivity associated with visual hallucinations following occipital stroke.,"Rafique, Sara A; Richards, John R; Steeves, Jennifer K E",Rafique,"Visual hallucinations that arise following vision loss stem from aberrant functional activity in visual cortices and an imbalance of activity across associated cortical and subcortical networks subsequent to visual pathway damage. We sought to determine if structural changes in white matter connectivity play a role in cases of chronic visual hallucinations associated with visual cortical damage. We performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic fiber tractography to assess white matter connectivity in a patient suffering from continuous and disruptive phosphene (simple) visual hallucinations for more than 2 years following right occipital stroke. We compared these data to that of healthy age-matched controls. Probabilistic tractography to reconstruct white matter tracts suggests regeneration of terminal fibers of the ipsilesional optic radiations in the patient. However, arrangement of the converse reconstruction of these tracts, which were seeded from the ipsilesional visual cortex to the intrahemispheric lateral geniculate body, remained disrupted. We further observed compromised structural characteristics, and changes in diffusion (measured using diffusion tensor indices) of white matter tracts in the patient connecting the visual cortex with frontal and temporal regions, and also in interhemispheric connectivity between visual cortices. Cortical remapping and the disruption of communication between visual cortices and remote regions are consistent with our previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data showing imbalanced functional activity of the same regions in this patient (Rafique et al, 2016, Neurology, 87, 1493-1500). Long-term adaptive and disruptive changes in white matter connectivity may account for the rare nature of cases presenting with chronic and continuous visual hallucinations.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.1010,PMC5991596,diffusion tensor imaging; magnetic resonance imaging; stroke; vision loss; visual hallucinations; white matter,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
38868082,Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS).,"Tsuchida, Aki; Sawada, Ken",Tsuchida,"Mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is increasingly recognized as a clinicoradiological syndrome. Its etiology is diverse, encompassing a variety of triggers, including infections and metabolic abnormalities. Uniquely, MERS may present with psychiatric symptoms, such as delirium, visual hallucinations, and catatonia, posing diagnostic challenges. The variability of these neuropsychiatric symptoms necessitates early diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to avoid prolonged antipsychotic treatment. This report details a case of MERS in a 39-year-old male. The patient initially presented with headache, sore throat, and abnormal laboratory results: leukocytosis, neutrophilia with a left shift, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and hyponatremia. On the fourth day of admission, he developed severe anxiety and restlessness, exhibited thoughts of death, and reported experiencing vivid hallucinations upon closing his eyes. MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion in the corpus callosum. A lumbar puncture showed no increase in cell count or protein. The patient showed a positive response to treatment with antibiotics and olanzapine, demonstrating rapid symptomatic improvement. A follow-up MRI on the 11th day showed complete resolution of the brain lesions. Six months later, no neurological or psychiatric sequelae were noted. The patient's clinical progression and imaging findings led to a definitive diagnosis of MERS. The early presentation of symptoms such as restlessness, hallucinations, and death ideation played a critical role in diagnosing MERS, with early MRI examination being instrumental in both diagnosis and preventing prolonged antipsychotic medication use.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,PCN reports : psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1002/pcn5.191,PMC11114290,MRI; closed‐eye visual hallucination; mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS); psychosis; tonsillitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

While often asymptomatic, they can manifest with neurological symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and focal deficits. We present a case of a 45-year-old male who presented with persistent headaches and visual hallucinations. Thorough clinical assessment revealed intermittent throbbing headaches localized to the left occipital region, accompanied by brief episodes of vivid visual hallucinations. Extensive work-up, including laboratory tests and neuroimaging, identified a subependymal cavernoma in the left occipital lobe. A surgical excision was performed, resulting in sustained relief from headaches and the absence of visual hallucinations during follow-up examinations. This case contributes to the understanding of cavernomas by detailing the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and successful surgical intervention for a subependymal cavernoma in the left occipital lobe. The resolution of symptoms postoperatively underscores the importance of individualized treatment approaches, considering factors such as lesion location, patient age, and associated risks.

We report a 22-year-old man with migraine associated with auditory hallucinations. Concurrent psychotic illness has been excluded. Brain MR scans showed a stable, patchy FLAIR hyperintensity over the posterolateral aspect of the left cerebral peduncle, just below the level of the red nucleus. This was felt to represent an area of gliosis based on the interval stability over 19 months. There was absence of features for aggressive neoplasms, such as lesional high cellular turnover (choline/NAA ratio >1.0) or high cerebral blood volume on advanced MR imaging with MR spectroscopy and dynamic perfusion MR. EEG and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were unremarkable. To our knowledge, there are no reports to date on similar auditory hallucinations in adult migraine patients, as well as with associated MRI brainstem lesions. The peduncular lesion could represent a previous migrainous infarct, and a possible analogy can be drawn from the descriptions of peduncular hallucinosis. Brainstem lesions, particularly in the midbrain and pons, have rarely been associated with this condition. It has been postulated that the damage to ascending reticular systems or thalamocortical circuitry may contribute to its pathogenesis.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,The journal of headache and pain,10.1007/s10194-011-0355-z,PMC3173622,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) was applied to the lesion site for 30 minutes daily over 5 consecutive days. Functional MRI (fMRI) was performed before and after rTMS treatment. Increased application of rTMS corresponded with a reduction in intensity of visual phosphene hallucinations and was reflected in altered blood oxygen level-dependent signal. fMRI revealed focal excitatory discharges at the border of the lesion, highlighting the origin of phosphenes. Post-rTMS, rTMS did not simply suppress activity in the patient but rather redistributed the previously imbalanced cortical activity not only at the stimulation site but in remote cortical regions so that it more closely resembled that of controls. This case is rare in its presentation of chronic continuous visual phosphene hallucinations following occipital stroke.

38453698,Visual hallucinations after resection of cerebral metastases: two patients with complex phantom images.,"Ovchinnikov, A; Andereggen, L; Rogers, S; Gschwind, M",Ovchinnikov,"Complex visual hallucinations are rarely seen in neurooncology. They are commonly observed alongside psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia or dementia, in Parkinson's or Lewy-body disease, after opioid medications or anesthesia, and, in particular, they appear with visual impairments. Here we report two normal-sighted and mentally healthy patients with unusual visual hallucinations after the resection and irradiation of brain metastases, the main features of which were persistent colorful and meaningful images with hallucinatory perseveration. These cases demonstrate the occurrence of complex visual hallucinations after resection of visual cortices as an effect of deafferentation, so-called visual release hallucinations or phantom images, similar to phantom pain after amputation of a limb. This case serves to heighten awareness in the radiooncology practitioner of the occurrence of visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome) related to multidisciplinary treatment of brain metastases.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

There was no history of reduced conscious level, psychosis or substance misuse. Neurological examination revealed an isolated right inferior quadrantopia, and the hallucinations were visible only in the area of the visual defect. A computed tomography scan confirmed a left occipital lobe infarct, congruent with the clinical signs. The infarct was deemed to be have originated from a septic embolus of his infected aortic valve and he was diagnosed with Charles Bonnet's syndrome (CBS). CBS is characterized by the presence of stereotyped visual hallucinations on a background of partial sight and in the absence of any psychotic illness. Early recognition can prevent wrongful diagnosis of a psychiatric condition, which may provide comfort to patients.

However, treatable causes including autoimmune encephalitis are often underrecognized and undertreated. A 72-year-old female patient was admitted with a 10-month history of rapidly progressive cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, paranoid behavior, diarrhea, and an 18-kg unintentional weight loss. On the physical exam, she was only oriented to the person and demonstrated an exaggerated startle response with diffuse rigidity. The initial clinical suspicion included CJD versus autoimmune encephalitis. Comprehensive laboratory testing, thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin antibodies, and autoimmune encephalitis panel were negative. The EEG showed mild to moderate diffuse slowing without any epileptiform abnormalities. An MRI brain revealed mild hippocampal atrophy. CSF testing revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis; RT-QuIC analysis and 14-3-3 protein were negative. There was no clinical improvement after treatment with IV steroids and IVIG. Repeated autoimmune encephalitis panel testing performed on a research basis was positive for dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) antibodies in serum and CSF.

A 35-year-old male with no past medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of polydipsia, generalized weakness, lightheadedness, and visual disturbances of one week duration. He was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis. His hemoglobin A1c was 11%. The patient was appropriately treated for diabetic ketoacidosis and it resolved on hospital day 1. On hospital day 2, the patient developed a fever of 101.6 °F and his mental status became severely altered. He developed auditory and visual hallucinations. IgM and IgG antibodies to West Nile Virus were positive in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The patient's creatine kinase level rose to 118,400 U/L during his hospitalization and eventually returned to baseline. The patient made a full recovery with no residual neurologic deficits after an 11 day hospital course. In this patient, neuroinvasive WNV was confirmed with positive CSF IgM. The patient's newly diagnosed diabetes likely contributed to his susceptibility to neuroinvasive disease. Furthermore, WNV encephalitis in a background of DKA has not been previously described in the literature and this case demonstrates WNV neuroinvasive disease should be in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. Diagnosis of neuroinvasive WNV is imperative to stop unnecessary therapies, limit further diagnostic evaluation, help predict patient outcomes, direct public health prevention measures, and further provide investigations into the clinical conditions that define the spectrum of WNV disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,IDCases,10.1016/j.idcr.2019.e00505,PMC6378900,DKA; Diabetic ketoacidosis; Neuroinvasive; Rhabdomyolysis; WNV; West Nile Virus,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

14662516,Out-of-body experience and autoscopy of neurological origin.,"Blanke, Olaf; Landis, Theodor; Spinelli, Laurent; Seeck, Margitta",Blanke,"During an out-of-body experience (OBE), the experient seems to be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical body. A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh040,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
38492041,A clinico-anatomical dissection of the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways in a patient with the Riddoch syndrome.,"Beyh, Ahmad; Rasche, Samuel E; Leff, Alexander; Ffytche, Dominic; Zeki, Semir",Beyh,"The Riddoch syndrome is thought to be caused by damage to the primary visual cortex (V1), usually following a vascular event. This study shows that damage to the anatomical input to V1, i.e., the optic radiations, can result in selective visual deficits that mimic the Riddoch syndrome. The results also highlight the differential susceptibility of the magnocellular and parvocellular visual systems to injury. Overall, this study offers new insights that will improve our understanding of the impact of brain injury and neurosurgery on the visual pathways. The Riddoch syndrome, characterised by the ability to perceive, consciously, moving visual stimuli but not static ones, has been associated with lesions of primary visual cortex (V1). We present here the case of patient YL who, after a tumour resection surgery that spared his V1, nevertheless showed symptoms of the Riddoch syndrome. Based on our testing, we postulated that the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) inputs to his V1 may be differentially affected. In a first experiment, YL was presented with static and moving checkerboards in his blind field while undergoing multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural, functional, and diffusion, acquired at 3 T. In a second experiment, we assessed YL's neural responses to M and P visual stimuli using psychophysics and high-resolution fMRI acquired at 7 T. YL's optic radiations were partially damaged but not severed. We found extensive activity in his visual cortex for moving, but not static, visual stimuli, while our psychophysical tests revealed that only low-spatial frequency moving checkerboards were perceived. High-resolution fMRI revealed strong responses in YL's V1 to M stimuli and very weak ones to P stimuli, indicating a functional P lesion affecting V1. In addition, YL frequently reported seeing moving stimuli and discriminating their direction of motion in the absence of visual stimulation, suggesting that he was experiencing visual hallucinations. Overall, this study highlights the possibility of a selective loss of P inputs to V1 resulting in the Riddoch syndrome and in hallucinations of visual motion.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-024-02774-8,PMC11004049,Blindsight; Magnocellular; Optic radiations; Parvocellular; Statokinetic dissociation; V5/MT + ,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The patient had been brought to the ED by her parents in an acutely psychotic state characterized by profound disorganization and vivid visual hallucinations. She was admitted to psychiatry and her hospital course was significant for both retarded and excited type catatonia, autonomic instability, and sensitivity to multiple neuroleptics. Given the atypicality of her symptoms and a family history of autoimmune disease, workup for autoimmune encephalitis was performed. MRI of the pelvis showed an indeterminate ovarian mass and laboratory studies were generally unremarkable. The catatonic symptoms resolved over the course of three weeks, eventually responding to a combination of lorazepam and olanzapine. Following discharge, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) panel resulted with positive titers for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. This case illustrates the need to consider autoimmune encephalitis in cases of catatonia.

Although studies suggested that visual hallucinations may be caused by brain damage in the visual system in CBS patients, alterations in specific brain regions in the occipital cortex have not been studied. Functional connectivity during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI; without hallucinations) in CBS patients, has never been explored. We aimed to investigate brain structural and functional changes in a patient with CBS, as compared with late blind (LB) and normally sighted subjects. We employed voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness analyses to investigate alterations in grey matter characteristics, and rs-fMRI to study changes in functional brain connectivity. Decreased grey matter volume was observed in the middle occipital gyrus and in the cuneus in the CBS patient, and in the middle occipital gyrus and in the lingual gyrus within LB subjects, compared to their respective control groups. Reductions in cortical thickness in associative and multimodal cortices were observed in the CBS patient when comparing with LB subjects. The precuneus exhibited increased functional connectivity with the secondary visual cortex in the CBS patient compared to the controls. In contrast, LB patients showed decreased functional connectivity compared to sighted controls between the DMN and the temporo-occipital fusiform gyrus, a region known to support hallucinations. Our findings suggest a reorganization of the functional connectivity between regions involved in self-awareness and in visual and salience processing in CBS that may contribute to the appearance of visual hallucinations.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0219656,PMC6638931,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

MOGAD rarely presents with unilateral cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE), rendering the diagnosis difficult in these cases. Furthermore, MOGAD is frequently accompanied by other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Herein, we report a case of unilateral CCE with positive anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. In addition, our patient presented with systemic symptoms as well as neurologic symptoms and was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC). A 60-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with an acute onset of headache and fever. Neurological examination revealed left-sided homonymous hemianopsia with intermittent visual hallucinations as flickering red-circular spots in the left visual field. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed focal hyperintensities and enhancement in the right temporo-parieto-occipital cortex. Electroencephalography indicated a focal seizure in the right occipital cortex. After the administration of an antiepileptic drug, the patient showed clinical and radiological improvements. She tested positive for serum anti-MOG antibodies and was diagnosed with anti-MOG-associated unilateral CCE. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms persisted, thus, a sigmoidoscopy was performed. The patient was diagnosed with comorbid UC. Steroids were administered to treat the UC and the gastrointestinal symptoms improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of MOGAD presenting as a unilateral CCE in Korea. This case highlights the clinical phenotypes of MOGAD and the need to assess comorbid autoimmune diseases in patients with MOGAD.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,"Encephalitis (Seoul, Korea)",10.47936/encephalitis.2023.00234,PMC11007549,Encephalitis; Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; Seizures; Ulcerative colitis,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

In this article, we present a case of alcohol withdrawal accompanied by PRES. A 53-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with visual hallucinations and meaningless speech. History from his relatives revealed that he has been consuming alcohol for about 35 years and the last consumption was 3 days before the admission. On neurological examination, there was limited cooperation and disorientation was evident to person, place and time. The speech was incoherent. No localizing sign was observed. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral hyperintense areas in medial occipital cortices and in subcortical white matter extending partly into parietal region. Treatment for alcohol withdrawal was started. Signs and symptoms regressed on the 7th day of the treatment as well as the lesions on MRI. The clinical presentation, characteristic MRI features together with the reversible nature of the syndrome suggest the diagnosis of PRES. The precise pathophysiological mechanism of PRES still remains unclear. Hypertension, clinical conditions that are associated with impaired cerebral auto-regulation as well as alcohol use which increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide may lead to the disruption of endothelial cells and blood-brain barrier breakdown.

Immediately after the onset of the stimulation, the 2 patients reported seeing their current own face, facing themselves, in their left visual field. Our study shows that the medial occipitoparietal junction has a key role in generating AH. This region has been shown to have a central role in various self-processing operations and especially in self-face recognition. Our observations further reveal that this region is involved in a visual representation of our own face, which is generated during the pathologic phenomenon of AH. This visual representation of our own face may be useful for self-face recognition and social cognition processes involving judgment of self-facial resemblance to others.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000000628,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years. Cerebrospinal IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-15, CCL5, G-CSF, PDGFbb, and VFGF were raised in the early stage of initial medical attention with nonspecific complaints, but were less prominent in the later stages of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms.

However, the extent of recovery varies depending on the case. Herein, we report the case of a 75-year-old woman with semi-rapidly progressive systemic tremors, visual hallucinations, and irritability. Upon hospitalization, she developed a mild fever and cognitive impairment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed semi-rapidly progressive diffuse cerebral atrophy (DCA) over 3 months, while no clear abnormal intensities were observed. The nerve conduction study revealed sensory and motor neuropathy in the limbs. The fixed tissue-based assay (TBA) failed to detect antineuronal antibodies; however, based on commercial immunoblots, the presence of anti-AMPH antibodies was suspected. Therefore, serum immunoprecipitation was performed, which confirmed the presence of anti-AMPH antibodies. The patient also had gastric adenocarcinoma. High-dose methylprednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered and tumor resection was performed, resulting in resolution of the cognitive impairment and improvement in the DCA on the post-treatment MRI. After immunotherapy and tumor resection, the patient's serum was analyzed using immunoprecipitation, which showed a decrease in the level of anti-AMPH antibodies. This case is noteworthy because the DCA showed improvement after immunotherapy and tumor resection. Additionally, this case demonstrates that negative TBA with positive commercial immunoblots do not necessarily indicate false positive results.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.1211814,PMC10322512,anti-amphiphysin syndrome; brain atrophy; encephalopathy; immunoprecipitation; neuropathy; paraneoplastic neurological syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The patient developed fever after dental treatment and found musical hallucination on the left ear worsened in degree and frequency. In a nearby clinic, she was treated with antibiotics, and her body temperature turned to normal in approximately 1 month. She presented to our hospital for workup on the worsened musical hallucination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple cerebral infarctions, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed an immobile hyperechoic mass with an acoustic shadow arising from a posterior cusp of the mitral valve. CAT was suspected and treated with apixaban and aspirin. Follow-up MRI and TTE showed newly developed multiple cerebral infarctions and rapidly diminished CAT. Cardiac surgery was performed to resect the CAT. The pathological findings showed calcifications surrounded by amorphous fibrous tissue including fibrin, indicating CAT. The patient's symptoms improved and no cerebral infarctions recurred in 4 months follow-up. Inflammation from an antecedent infection can cause CAT to grow rapidly. Fibrous tissue including fibrin may attach to the surface of CAT, resulting in multiple cerebral infarctions.

23676430,Escitalopram for antipsychotic nonresponsive visual hallucinosis: eight patients suffering from Charles Bonnet syndrome.,"Bergman, Yoseph; Barak, Yoram",Bergman,"The Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterized by distinct visual hallucinations and ocularpathology causing visual impairment in patients with insight and the absence of psychiatric comorbidity. The number of reported cases of CBS is expanding as the population ages and the prevalence of vision disorders increases. Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed. However, their efficacy in CBS has been based on sketchy evidence. The use of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for CBS was anecdotally reported. We herein describe effectiveness of escitalopram in a series of patients suffering from CBS who were unresponsive to antipsychotic treatment. Eight consecutive patients suffering from CBS who did not respond to standard antipsychotic treatment were switched to escitalopram. CBS severity prior to escitalopram treatment was quantified using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and again after eight weeks of treatment. All had undergone brain CT and cognitive assessment. Brain CT imaging was normal except for an incidental finding of a small frontal meningioma in one patient. All had Mini-Mental Status Examination scores of ≥ 27/30. There were four men and four women, with a mean age of 81.7 ± 7.3 years. Previous antipsychotic treatment was mostly with risperidone, 1.0 to 3.0 mg/daily. Mean CGI-severity upon switching to escitalopram treatment was 5.7. This was significantly reduced to 1.8 (p < 0.001) after eight weeks of escitalopram treatment (mean dose: 11.8 mg/daily). There were no side effects, nor any adverse events were reported. This is the first case-series to show that SSRI is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for visual hallucinations associated with vision impairment such as in CBS.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,International psychogeriatrics,10.1017/S1041610213000719,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Various neurodegenerative disorders cause PPA. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one known cause of PPA, and little is known about this association. Almost all published cases of PPA associated with DLB are the logopenic variant of PPA. Here, we describe the novel case of a patient with DLB presenting clinical features of the semantic variant PPA (svPPA). A 75-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a 2-year history of progressive anomia and amnesia. Two months before admission, she had been experiencing visual hallucinations, and at the age of 60 years, she had venous infarction in the left temporal lobe, which she recovered from without any residual symptoms. Upon admission to our hospital, she displayed anomia, impaired single-word comprehension, and surface dyslexia with preserved repetition and speech production. These symptoms met the criteria for the diagnosis of svPPA. <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography and <sup>123</sup>I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy indicated DLB. Thus, she was administered donepezil, and this dramatically improved her symptoms. We hypothesize that the combination of DLB with the previous asymptomatic venous thrombosis in the left temporal lobe may have contributed to the ""svPPA"" in this patient. In conclusion, we show that PPA associated with DLB could be treated with donepezil, and we suggest that donepezil should be pursued as a treatment option for PPA.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,eNeurologicalSci,10.1016/j.ensci.2021.100318,PMC7829141,"123I-IMP SPECT, 123I-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography; 123I-MIBG, 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine; DLB, dementia with Lewy bodies; DaT, 123I-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Donepezil; MMSE-J, Mini-Mental State Examination Japanese version; MRI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging; MoCA-J, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version; PPA, primary progressive aphasia; Primary progressive aphasia; Semantic dementia; Stroke; TLPA, Test of Lexical Processing in Aphasia; Treatment; WAB, Western Aphasia Battery; lvPPA, logopenic variant PPA; svPPA, semantic variant PPA",Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

The present paper describes a 66-year-old male patient with a long history of schizophrenia, whose psychotic symptoms displayed qualitative and quantitative changes after a closed-head injury. After a very disturbed childhood and youth, including several jail terms, the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 1960s and frequently thereafter hospitalized. Visual hallucinations were the dominant symptom, and art therapy provided some relief, which led to a successful artistic career. In 1989, while actively hallucinating, he suffered a mild TBI in a pedestrian accident. Despite findings of organic dysfunction, he did not receive full neuropsychological diagnosis and treatment until four years later, when he presented with symptoms of perseveration, hemispatial neglect, and disturbances of working memory. The patient then received an individual program of neuropsychological rehabilitation, while his treating psychiatrist gradually withdrew psychotropic medication. After a year of therapy there was marked improvement of both neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms. At the same time, he began to paint in a completely different style. The case described here shows that the pathomechanisms of schizophrenia and neurobehavioral disturbances resulting from organic brain damage are not after all unrelated.

Brain imaging may play a pivotal role in determining the etiology as it did for the case presented here. A new case of central nervous system (CNS) SLE is presented along with an analysis of 33 comparable cases from the scientific literature. A 70-year-old female with subacute cutaneous lupus presented to a university-based geropsychiatry program after 1 year of benign visual hallucinations and several months of shuffling gait, recurrent falls, and forgetfulness. These symptoms were highly suggestive of Lewy body dementia; however, the patient's history of basal ganglia infarct, cognitive testing demonstrating inattention and executive dysfunction, and follow-up brain imaging, which did not reveal acute findings, aligned with cerebral pathology previously attributed to vasculitis and supported the diagnosis of subcortical dementia due to SLE-CNS vasculitis. Oral prednisone 20 mg daily resolved her symptoms. Over the next 19 months, her prednisone was tapered completely and her symptoms did not return. A systematic literature search identified 33 comparable cases. An analysis of previously published cases suggests that extending the duration of the prednisone taper beyond 1 year may decrease the risk of later occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms in this patient population.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,10.1177/0891988720901788,,Lewy body dementia; case report; lymphocytic angiitis; psychosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; vasculitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We elaborate on M's recovery and rehabilitation process from onset to the 8-month follow-up. The cognitive functions were evaluated with a comprehensive screening battery at 4 weeks after extubation and at the 8-month follow-up. Following extubation, M. was delirious, reported visual hallucinations, and had severe sleeping difficulties. At about 3 months after COVID-19 onset, M. showed mild to moderate deficits on tests measuring processing speed, working memory, and attention. At assessments at 8 months, M. performed better, with results above average on tests measuring learning, memory, word fluency, and visuospatial functions. Minor deficits were still found regarding logical reasoning, attention, executive functioning, and processing speed. There were no lingering psychiatric symptoms. While M. had returned to a part-time job, he was not able to resume previous work-tasks.

32624069,Brief cognitive behavioural therapy for post-stroke 'delusional infestation' in a 71-year-old man: a single case experimental design.,"McKinnon, Aimee I; Dow, Rebecca",McKinnon,"Delusional infestation is a condition at the interface of tactile and visual hallucinations and delusions. Individuals with this condition hold the fixed and false belief that their body or their environment is infested with parasites, insects or other organisms. There are no guidelines or publications detailing the psychological assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation of this presentation. This paper aims to address this gap. Single case experimental design methodology was employed to evaluate the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for delusional infestation in a 70-year-old male who was intolerant of anti-psychotic medication. 'Tom' had a large, mature infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory as well as a left posterior parietal infarct post-stroke, which may have precipitated his symptoms. After a baseline period of 3 weeks, Tom received eight sessions of CBT based on the model by Collerton and Dudley (2004). Post-intervention, there was a reliable improvement on clinical measures as well as a large reduction in distress levels, which was maintained at 3-month follow-up. The conviction in the belief that the infestation was real did not shift. This case demonstrated the potential for the use of CBT to address distress related to delusional infestation. This work is discussed in relation to post-stroke psychosis, psychological therapies with older adults, and suggestions are made for future research.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,10.1017/S1352465820000405,,CBT; cognitive behavioural therapy; delusional infestation; delusional parasitosis; older adult; organic hallucinosis; post-stroke psychosis; single case experimental design; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

These hallucinations typically take the form of dreamy de novo productions (phanteidolias), less often that of transformations of perceptions into new items (such as seeing faces in clouds) called pareidolias. However, hallucinations taking the form of a complex distortion of perception is a different phenomenon, which to our knowledge has not been reported. We studied 2 patients with complex, 'fantastic', perceptive distortion involving the visual and auditory systems after thalamic stroke limited to the region of the dorsomedial nucleus, sparing the intralaminar nuclei and the midbrain (explaining the lack of disorders of consciousness and confusional state). Our patients reported the modification of usual stimuli (face, body, voices) into unreal, fantastically distorted perceptions (monstrous change of shapes or sounds without appearance of new items). While the exact mechanism leading to such perceptive distortions remains unknown, a release phenomenon due to damage to the dorsomedial thalamus (probably affecting cholinergic system) responsible for a disinhibition of cortical function involved in familiarity of perception seems likely.

To date, to our knowledge, it has not been described in patients undergoing surgical resection for occipital lobe epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia. To describe a patient who experienced complex visual hallucinations following resection of cortical dysplasia on the right occipital lobe and who was diagnosed as having Charles Bonnet syndrome. A 35-year-old woman underwent surgical resection for medically intractable epilepsy caused by cortical dysplasia involving the right occipital lobe. Two months after resection of the epileptogenic zone, complex visual hallucinations in the left visual field not associated with loss of consciousness or delusion developed in the patient. Hallucinations persisted for more than 12 months despite treatment with antiepileptic medications. During hallucination, no electrographic seizures were recorded through long-term video-electroencephalographic monitoring. Charles Bonnet syndrome may occur in a patient with occipital lobe epilepsy following resection of the diseased brain with a developmental malformation.

26703004,Hearing One's Voice in Your Speech: An Unusual Case of Palinacousis Due to Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Rosenberg, Daniel; Latorre, Julius G S",Rosenberg,"Palinacousis or auditory perseveration is a form of acquired auditory perceptual disorder that occurs rarely due to an acute intracranial process. The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention. Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",{},,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000069,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

32516303,Cerebellar Parieto-occipital Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and Cerebral Metamorphopsia Associated with Asymptomatic Atrial Septum Vegetation and Renal Disease: Case Report.,"Ghaffari-Rafi, Arash; Netzel, Anthony C; Prat, Madeline; Miles, Daniel T",Ghaffari-Rafi,"BACKGROUND Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a poorly characterized and enigmatic syndrome. Despite consistently presenting with nervous system vasogenic edema, this malady has been associated with variable triggers, neurological symptoms, and natural history. CASE REPORT The report presents a 25-year old African American female who presented with altered mental status and bilateral cortical blindness. Neuroimaging identified vasogenic edema in the cerebellum, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. Her PRES was associated with a hypertensive emergency, renal failure, and an atrial septum vegetation (culture-negative endocarditis). All 3 contributing etiologies were addressed, upon which the patient began to recover. During recovery, the patient experienced cerebral metamorphopsia, visualizing her entire environment in the form of a cartoon. After 2 weeks of treatment she recovered to baseline state of heath, with vasogenic edema resolved on follow-up neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS This case presents a rarely catalogued phenomena during PRES recovery, cerebral metamorphopsia, along with a new potential association (culture negative atrial septum endocarditis). The report also highlights how PRES recovery patients (with cortical blindness) should be explicitly assessed for cerebral metamorphopsia and Charles Bonnet syndrome - which may distress patients. Lastly, the atypical presentation of cerebellar vasogenic edema in our patient validates existing literature that PRES does not have a uniform picture and is not well served by its current name or proposed diagnostic criteria. Therefore, renaming the disorder to reversible vasogenic edema syndrome and derestricting the diagnostic criteria, may prevent clinicians from being discouraged when faced with diagnosing PRES in the face of atypical findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.923441,PMC7304656,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neuropsychological tests performed during NCSE demonstrated deficits encompassing several cognitive domains. The short-lasting complex visual hallucinations were stereotypical, vivid, and accompanied by intense fear. The seizure activity in the right temporo-parieto-occipital region, as documented by SISCOM and electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, was thought to be due to an unusual clinical presentation of NCSE. Subcortical cerebromalacia likely blocked the propagation route, restricting the ictal activities within this area.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2012.07.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
828866,Simple formed hallucinations confined to the area of a specific visual field defect.,"Lance, J W",Lance,"Thirteen patients with transient or permanent homonymous visual field defects experienced formed hallucinations localized to the affected part of the visual field. The lesion was occipital in 8 instances (infarction 7, porencephalic cyst 1), parietooccipital in 3 (infarction 2, angioma 1) and probably parietal in 2 (epilepsy 1, encephalitis 1). The disorder involved the right hemisphere in 9 cases, the left hemisphere in 3 cases and both hemispheres sequentially in one patient. Hallucinations were accompanied by palinopsia in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case. This particular type of hallucination is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes. Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects. There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story. In most cases, the hallucinations were not clearly related to any visual memory. It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative. The occurrence of such hallucinations with a visual field defect suggests that the cells of the association cortex are more likely to discharge spontaneously once they are deprived of their normal afferent inflow from the calcarine cortex.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/99.4.719,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
17354087,Domain-specific deficits in schizophrenia.,"Laws, Keith R; Leeson, Verity C; McKenna, Peter J",Laws,"Object recognition deficits are well documented in certain neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, herpes simplex encephalitis). Although agnosic problems have been documented in some patients with schizophrenia (Gabrovska et al., 2003), no study has investigated whether such deficits differentially affect specific categories of information (as they sometimes do in neurological cases). In Part I of this study, we compared object recognition in 55 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 22 age- and NART IQ-matched healthy controls. In Part II, we present a detailed case study of one patient with schizophrenia (DH) who displays a severe category specific semantic knowledge for living things. Of the patients with schizophrenia, 75% had object recognition below the 5th percentile, and in 11% of cases, a highly specific classical category dissociation emerged (5 cases with nonliving deficit and 1 with living deficit); and two other patients showed strong dissociation for living things. These findings provide convincing evidence of a classical double dissociation across the two categories. In Part II, the in-depth case study of one schizophrenic patient (DH), documented a profound agnosia for living things. While DH displayed intact low level perceptual and spatial ability and could copy drawings, he was severely impaired at naming, picture-name matching, semantic fluency, and could not describe or draw items from memory. The presence of impaired object recognition in most schizophrenic patients, along with highly selective category specific deficits in a minority, is discussed with reference to similar findings in neurological patients.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,10.1080/13546800500286429,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It is typically caused by mesencephalic lesions. Nonetheless, a few cases have also been reported, in which the same syndrome was associated with thalamic and pontine lesions. We report the case of a 63-year-old male patient presenting to the Emergency Department of our hospital with irritability, gait difficulty, and diplopia of sudden onset two hours ago. Neurological examination revealed dysarthria, right facial palsy, bilateral gaze palsy, dysmetria of his left extremities, left-sided hemihypaethesia and extensory plantar response on the left. Brain computerized tomography (CT) showed a hemorrhagic lesion on the right lateral side of the pons. During his hospitalization at the Department of Neurology, he developed visual hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, insomnia, and strong emotional response. An extensive laboratory screening was performed and showed no abnormal findings. Suspecting peduncular hallucinosis due to the brainstem lesion, treatment with quetiapine and melatonin was administered to the patient and symptoms resolved completely within days. Subsequently, gradual neurological clinical improvement was also noted and two weeks after his admission, a repeated brain CT and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed partial absorption of the brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent rehabilitation for two months, showing further clinical improvement, and treatment with quetiapine and melatonin was discontinued without any further episodes being noted. A repeated brain MRI was performed two months after his admission to our hospital and showed no hemorrhage, but a mixed signal intensity core and a hypointense hemosiderin rim at the location of the absorbed hemorrhagic lesion, compatible with pontine carvenoma. Peduncular hallucinosis is most commonly associated with ischemic lesions of the posterior brain blood circulation, but different lesions have been reported, like vasospasm, brain tumors, encephalitis, hemorrhage associated with vascular malformations, such as a carvenoma, as seen in our case, representing a very rare form of peduncular hallucinosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,10.22365/jpsych.2023.026,,Peduncular hallucinosis; carvenoma; case report; hemorrhage; pons,Case Reports,Greece,eng

This report documents the alterations in waking, sleeping, and dreaming caused by a lateral medullary infarct. Total insomnia and the initial suppression of dreaming was followed by the gradual recovery of both functions. A visual hallucinosis during waking that was associated with the initial period of sleep and dream suppression is described in detail. Since the changes in sleep and their recovery are comparable to results of animal experiments, it can be concluded that damage to the medullary brain stem causes extreme but short-lived alterations in conscious state and that substantial recovery occurs even though the damage to the brain stem endures.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1016/s1053-8100(02)00011-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Ahmad, Am Fam Physician, 1991;44:1142, 1144). An 89 year old caucasian man with an acute coronary syndrome who had no psychiatric history and no infections, brain injury, stroke, metabolic nor neoplastic disease developed delirium after two small doses of metoprolol (25 mg). The delirium disappeared within 20 hours after metoprolol was ceased, despite continuing all other medications. THE COMBINED SERIES: Of 24 patients (12 women, mean age 71.8 years), 83% were older than 60 years. The duration of therapy before onset of delirium in 14 (58%) subjects was within one week; 23 of 24 patients were receiving therapeutic amounts of the drug (25-200 mg/day). Clinical features included confusion/disorientation in all subjects, agitation in 13, aggression in 6, visual hallucinations in 7, auditory hallucinations in 1, paranoid delusions in 3, vivid dreams in 2 and language disturbances in 3 persons. Bradycardia was reported in 4 cases, hypotension in 2, fatigue/tiredness in 3, Raynaud's phenomenon in 1 and skin rash in 1 patient. The mechanism of metoprolol-induced delirium is unclear. It could be due to impairment of hepatic metabolism (especially in the ageing liver) and complex neurotransmitter-related effects on brain beta-adrenoceptors and serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Physicians should be aware that metoprolol, a widely used beta-blocker, may rarely cause delirium, especially in the elderly population.",{},,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,10.1023/a:1015761618314,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Patient 1, a 58-year-old male taxi driver, suddenly lost his way while driving home. At presentation he could neither describe nor draw a route from one place to another. This patient gradually regained his topographic orientation over the course of 3 months.

He could describe and draw a map of a route in detail, although the streets that he traveled daily appeared strange to him. The topographic disorientation of patient 2 had changed little 3 years after the onset. Both patients had left homonymous hemianopia, but no prosopagnosia, constructional apraxia, unilateral spatial neglect, or other cortical dysfunction. Brain computed tomography revealed an infarct of the right posterior cerebral artery, involving the cuneus and lingual gyri, in both patients.

A temporobasal location is very rare, and there have been no reports regarding single sulcus involvement of ETs. We describe the case of an ET located on the basal surface of the temporal lobe, predominantly within the collateral sulcus, which separates the parahippocampal gyrus medially from the fusiform gyrus laterally. We report the case of a 25-year-old woman with complex visual hallucinations. MRI of the brain revealed a right temporobasal mass lesion, hypointense on T(1)-weighted and hyperintense on T(2)-weighted images, with minimal contrast enhancement, on the basal surface of the temporal lobe. Right-sided anterior temporal lobectomy, along with microsurgical removal of the collateral sulcus ET were performed with consequent resection of mesial temporal structures (the region of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala). It is important to consider ETs when treating lesions on the basal temporal lobe, since the inferior surface of the temporal lobe, more specifically the collateral sulcus, may be a convenient space for ETs to localize. Total surgical resection should be the goal in these cases; however, the surgical approach may be tailored to include the resection of mesial temporal lobe structures when seizure is the predominant presenting symptom.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2006.06.024,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

Report of four cases.,"Freiman, Thomas M; Surges, Rainer; Vougioukas, Vassilios I; Hubbe, Ulrich; Talazko, Jochen; Zentner, Josef; Honegger, Jürgen; Schulze-Bonhage, Andreas",Freiman,"The development of visual hallucinations after loss of vision is known as the Charles Bonnet syndrome. This phenomenon was first described in 1760 by Charles Bonnet and others during their observations of elderly patients with degeneration of the retina or cornea. To date a clear association between visual hallucinations and neurosurgical procedures has not been reported. Because of their clear demarcation, however, surgical lesions in the cerebrum offer a unique opportunity to determine the pathoanatomical aspects of visual hallucinations. During a 3-year period, 41 consecutive patients who acquired visual field defects after neurosurgery were examined for the occurrence of visual hallucination. Postoperatively, four of these patients experienced visual hallucinations. In two of them an upper quadrantanopia developed after the patients had undergone selective amygdalohippocampectomy. In the other two patients a complete hemianopia developed, in one case after resection of a parietal astrocytoma and in the other after resection of an occipital glioblastoma multiforme. The visual hallucinations were transient and gradually disappeared between 4 days and 6 months postoperatively. The patients were aware of the fact that their hallucinations were fictitious and displayed no psychosis. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained in only two patients and epileptic discharges were found. Deafferentiation of cortical association areas may lead to the spontaneous generation of complex visual phenomena. In the present series this phenomenon occurred in approximately 10% of patients with postoperative visual field defects. In all four cases the central optic radiation was damaged between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex. The complex nature of the visual hallucination indicates that they were generated in visual association areas.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2004.101.5.0846,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
16532698,[A case of left dorsomedial thalamic infarction with unilateral schizophrenia-like auditory hallucinations].,"Yoshida, Yukihiro; Abe, Koji; Yoshizawa, Kikuko",Yoshida,"We report a case of a right-handed, 73-year-old woman with auditory hallucinations lateralized to the right ear. A brain MRI revealed a small infarction in the left dorsomedial nucleus (DM) of the thalamus. The patient did not have either psychiatric or neurological prior history, and had otherwise been treated for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. Two months prior to admission, she had become forgetful, and had lost her wallet several times. She concurrently began to experience auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of her acquaintances, or ""the gods"". She frequently monologized and wandered about outside following the contents of the hallucinations. Therefore, she was admitted to our institution. On admission, no apparent abnormalities were revealed by physical examinations or blood analyses. She was alert and had no aphasic symptoms. Except for memory disturbances, no neurological symptoms, including no hearing loss, were found. A brain MRI showed a small localized infarction in the left DM, but EEG findings were normal. The patient had prominent anterograde memory deficits: she hardly remembered what she had done the very same day, or the names of the doctor and hospital. She also demonstrated a retrograde amnesia of the past decade or two: she showed difficulty recalling either personal history or social events that occurred during this era. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) revealed a total IQ of 75 (verbal IQ 77; performance IQ 77). The verbal hallucinations continued with frequent occurrence even after admission. They included voices telling her about misfortunes, such as death or sickness, of her relatives. These turned into threats and commands, such as ""I'm gonna kill ya. I attack you from behind. You, do not eat!"" In addition, she occasionally experienced ""third person auditory hallucination"", in which several men were discussing the plan to kill her. As is characteristic of this type of case, the hallucinations always appeared in only her right ear. They did not occur in the other modalities (e.g. as a visual one). She was convinced that the hallucinations were real and looked frightened while they were happening. Whereas the anterograde amnesia continued for 6 months after admission, the retrograde amnesia gradually improved within 2 or 3 months after admission, although a partial amnesia on the past decade eventually turned out to persistent. On the other hand, the hallucinations did not ameliorate satisfactorily with risperidone (3-6 mg/day), but on augmentation with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day), they lessened gradually and almost disappeared within 6 months. She also slowly developed symptoms similar to those of frontal lobe syndrome, i.e., aspontaneity and apathy. In conclusion, our case indicates the importance of DM on memory function. It is noteworthy that schizophrenia-like hallucinations developed in the case. Localized neuronal deficits evoked by infarction in the left DM probably caused the schizophrenia-like hallucinations; the lateralization phenomenon further indicates the involvement of specific neuronal mechanisms in the mediation of the hallucinations. According to the knowledge of the functional anatomy of the DM and the lateralization phenomenon of auditory hallucinations, it is possible that the neuronal loop, comprised of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, designated as ""basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits"", in addition to the left temporal cortex, plays an important role in the development of the hallucinations in this case. This possibility might also shed light on the neurological basis of schizophrenia.",{},,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

14665823,Exacerbation of mania secondary to right temporal lobe astrocytoma in a bipolar patient previously stabilized on valproate.,"Sokolski, Kenneth N; Denson, Thomas F",Sokolski,"To investigate breakthrough mania secondary to a right temporal lobe neoplasm in a bipolar patient previously stabilized on sodium divalproex. Right hemispheric brain tumors involving the orbitofrontal or basotemporal cortex are a rare cause of secondary mania. In such cases, early neurologic signs may be difficult to distinguish from bipolar symptoms. Breakthrough mania secondary to brain neoplasm in a bipolar patient stabilized on medication is an extremely rare phenomena which has not been previously reported. The clinical course of a bipolar subject stabilized on valproate who developed mania secondary to a right temporal lobe astrocytoma is described. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuropsychiatric evaluations were used to examine the relationship between the patient's brain mass and behavioral disturbances. Symptoms were those that accompanied prior episodes of mania. In addition, signs of temporal lobe dysfunction were evident including periods of detachment, déjà vu experiences, and olfactory hallucinations. In the context of mania, depersonalization was initially attributed to bipolar symptoms. Only several months later, when olfactory hallucinations and alterations in consciousness became evident, was a temporal lobe lesion suspected. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities responded to a combination of surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and topiramate, however the tumor was advanced and invasive at diagnosis resulting in a poor prognosis. This case suggests that clinicians examining unexplained cases of breakthrough mania should be vigilant for early signs of temporal lobe dysfunction, which could aid in detecting treatable lesions.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/00146965-200312000-00005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

We describe an interesting case of a 61-year-old male who presented with a second episode of psychosis along with mild to moderate cognitive impairment like having difficulty in buttoning for over eight months at our tertiary care hospital. Previously, during the first episode, he was treated by a private practitioner; adequate doses for an adequate duration of two atypical antipsychotics were given; and up to 25% global improvement was reported by the caregiver. During the current episode, he experienced delusions, in which he had a conviction that a ""WIFI"" was capable of ""thought-making"" functions. During the past four months, his delusions exacerbated and were accompanied by hallucinations of other modalities, like visual and kinesthetic hallucinations, which profoundly impacted his daily life. He used to hear voices. While listening to the voices, he also experienced voices coming out of his mouth. All these were experienced by him in clear consciousness daily for a few hours. All plausible medical causes of late-onset psychosis, such as neuroinflammatory/immunological disorders, were ruled out. Neuroimaging revealed T2-weighted image (T2WI)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in bilateral subcortical and periventricular deep white matter, suggestive of small vessel ischemic changes in the brain. The diagnosis of VLOSLP is completely rationalized by evidence-based medicine. Hence, the role of cerebrovascular risk factors, as well as age-related neurobiological processes, in the pathogenesis of VLOSLP is discussed. Future research ought to emphasize identifying a particular biomarker that would be highly predictive for accurately diagnosing VLOSLP and giving it an identity to separate it from various overlapping clinical conditions such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and other types of dementia with psychosis so that the patient can be given specific treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.57510,PMC11066694,cognitive; dementia; hallucinations; psychosis; schizophrenia-like,Case Reports,United States,eng

Bifrontal brain injury, bilateral enucleation, affective indifference (anosodiaphoria), generalized anosognosia, and the conviction that vision will resume mark clear clinical differences with Anton syndrome. Differentiating these findings from Anton syndrome will help occupational therapists, neuropsychologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, and physicians when assessing frontal lobe brain injury with total and partial visual loss.

28834867,Cortical blindness and not optic neuritis as a cause of vision loss in a Sjögren's syndrome (SS) patient with the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD): Challenges of ascribing demyelinating syndromes to SS: a case report.,"Lalji, Aliya; Izbudak, Izlem; Birnbaum, Julius",Lalji,"The conception that multiple sclerosis may be challenging to distinguish from demyelinating manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) was introduced more than 30 years ago. However, it is now recognized that the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may occur more frequently in SS as opposed to multiple sclerosis. Characteristic NMOSD features can include severe attacks of optic neuritis, myelitis which is frequently longitudinally-extensive (spanning at least three vertebral segments on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and an association with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies. In addition, whereas NMOSD was initially thought to spare the brain, it is now recognized that brain lesions occur in a majority of NMOSD patients. Therefore, it is important for the multi-disciplinary team of physicians who care for SS patients to understand this widening spectrum of NMOSD as encompassing brain lesions. In this case-report we describe clinical features, radiographic findings, and treatment of a SS NMOSD patient presenting with severely decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, and encephalopathy. The SS NMOSD patient presented with rapid, bilateral onset of severely decreased visual acuity and was therefore suspected as having bilateral optic neuritis. However, the patient lacked stigmata of optic neuritis, instead had visual hallucinations and encephalopathy suggestive of cortical blindness, and was noted to have occipital lobe lesions on brain MRI. Other radiographic findings included simultaneous enhancement of brainstem and periventricular lesions. The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone with no change in her neurological deficits. She was then treated with plasma exchange therapy. The patient had resolution of decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, encephalopathy, and contrast-enhancing brain lesions in response to plasma exchange therapy. We provide the first example of severely decreased visual acuity in a NMOSD patient due to cortical blindness and not bilateral optic neuritis. This finding expands the spectrum of central nervous system syndromes and brain lesions which may occur in NMOSD. The synchronous enhancement of a brainstem lesion (known to occur in NMOSD) with occipital lobe lesions also suggests that our patient's occipital lobe findings were due to NMOSD. All of our patient's findings had an excellent clinical and radiographic response to plasma exchange therapy.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000007454,PMC5571989,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Their occurrence due to focal brain lesions is rare, most probably due to underreporting, which limits progress in understanding their underlying mechanisms and anatomical determinants. In this single case study, an 86-year-old patient experienced, in the context of an acute right central opercular ischemic stroke, visual hallucinatory symptoms (including palinopsia), differently lateralized auditory hallucinations and FOP. This unusual clinical constellation could be precisely documented and illustrated while still present, allowing a realistic and immersive visual experience validated by the patient. The acute stroke appeared to be their most plausible cause (after exclusion of other etiologies). Furthermore, accurate analysis of tractographic data suggested that disruption in the posterior bundle of the superior longitudinal fasciculus connecting the stroke lesion to the inferior parietal lobule was the anatomical substrate explaining the FOP and, indirectly, also hallucinations through whiter matter involvement, in coherence with existing literature. We could finally elaborate on symptoms taxonomy and phenomenology (e.g., polyopic heautoscopy, hallucinatory FOP, etc), and on patient's remarkable distancing from them (with some therapeutic implications supported by plausibly engaged mechanisms). This case not only authentically enriched the description of such rare combination of heterogenous illusory symptoms through this novel visualization-based reporting approach, but disclosed an unrevealed anatomo-clinical link relating all of them to the acute stroke lesion through an association fiber, thereby contributing to the understanding of these intriguing symptoms and their determinants.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.12.020,,Diffusion tensor imaging tractography; Feeling of a presence; Hallucination; Opercular stroke; Superior longitudinal fasciculus,Case Reports,Italy,eng

Although vivid and life) like, these hallucinations are generally not mistaken for reality. In view of the associated neurological symptoms, this syndrome was first believed to occur only with lesions of the mesencephalon.

We describe a patient who experienced very similar hallucinations following a unilateral infarct restricted to the cerebellum, rostral protuberance and posterior thalamus. No lesion was seen in the mesencephalon with MRI. This case confirms that the lesions responsible for peduncular hallucinosis are not restricted to the mesencephalon, which suggests that several interconnected neural structures are probably involved in the genesis of this type of visual hallucinations. During the days following the stroke, our patient also experienced transient sensations of pleasure which he considered as abnormal. In view of the site of the lesions in this case, the visual hallucinations may be explained by a disinhibition of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves.

Here we report the third long-lasting case of autoscopy in a patient with right occipital lesion. Instead of the commonly reported frontal mirror view (fantôme spéculaire), the patient saw her head and upper trunk laterally in side view (fantôme de profil). We found that the visual appearance and completeness of the autoscopic image could be selectively modulated by active and passive movements, without being influenced by imagining the same movements or by tactile and auditory stimulation. Eyes closure did not disrupt either the perception of the autoscopic body or the effects of the motor stimulation. Moreover, the visual body reduplication was coded neither in purely eye-centered nor in head-centered frames of reference, suggesting the involvement of egocentric coordinate systems (eyes and head centered). A follow-up examination highlighted the stability of the visual characteristics of the body reduplication and its shift induced by displacement of both head and eyes. These findings support the view that autoscopic phenomena have a multisensory motor origin and proprioceptive signals may play an important role in modulating the illusory visual reduplication of the patient's own body, most likely via cross-modal modulation of extrastriate areas involved in body and face perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21569,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
7526249,Delayed cerebral ischemia manifesting as peduncular hallucinosis after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage--three case reports.,"Yano, K; Kuroda, T; Tanabe, Y; Yamada, H",Yano,"Three cases of peduncular hallucinosis occurred in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. All patients underwent early clipping of the ruptured aneurysms of the anterior circulation. Several days after onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the patients complained of vivid visual hallucinations associated with abnormal sleep-waking rhythms, suggesting a diagnosis of peduncular hallucinosis. The hallucinations disappeared with administration of an increased dose of dobutamine. These findings indicated that peduncular hallucinosis might be a manifestation of delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage. No other possible cause of neurological deficits such as hydrocephalus, cerebral infarcts, or metabolic encephalopathies was identified. Damage to the ascending reticular activating system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of peduncular hallucinosis. Cerebral vasospasm in the perforating arteries of the ascending reticular activating system was probably the cause of the hallucinosis in our patients.",{},,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.34.593,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng
22031164,[Leptomeningeal spread of an intramedullary cervical pilocytic astrocytoma: case report and literature review].,"Jusué-Torres, I; Alcázar-Vaquerizo, L; Gómez-Angulo, J C; Navarro-Torres, R; López-Serrano, R; García-Miralles, N",Jusué-Torres,"BACKGROUND. The rarest location of pilocytic astrocytoma is intramedullary. Gliomas represent up to 24 - 30% of intramedullary tumors in adulthood and are second only after ependymomas. Leptomeningeal dissemination through cerebrospinal fluid is unusual and occurs predominantly in medulloblastomas, ependymoblastomas, central neuroblastomas, ependymomas, germ cell tumors and high-grade gliomas. The majority of spinal cord gliomas reporting metastasis were anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastomas multiforme and relatively few were low-grade gliomas. The incidence of leptomeningeal spread of low-grade tumors is rare. A rare cranial extension of brain leptomeningeal dissemination in an intramedullary pilocytic astrocytoma during adulthood is reported. CASE REPORT. A 51 year-old-man with a recurrent intramedullary mass at C5-C7 level operated 4 times with all pathological anatomy reports describing the lesion as Pilocytic Astrocytoma developed, after 15 years from the diagnosis, visual hallucinations and his level of consciousness worsened to Glasgow coma score 13/15. The MRI showed highly enhanced cranial and spinal leptomeninges and paquimeninges with a micro nodular-granulomatous aspect associated with intense affectation of basal cisterns, subarachnoid spaces and convexity of both cerebral hemispheres suggestive of leptomeningeal spread of the spinal mass. The patient expired after three days. CONCLUSION. Leptomeningeal spread is a rare phenomenon and when it happens usually doesn't change the primary tumor's behavior. In our case the aggressiveness could be explained by a potential malignization of the primary tumor that it was not documented because of the partial resections from the lasts surgeries or instead the tumor was actually a monomorphous pilomyxoid tumor.",{},,"Neurocirugia (Asturias, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
24263164,Management of auditory hallucinations as a sequela of traumatic brain injury: a case report and a relevant literature review.,"Dobry, Yuriy; Novakovic, Vladan; Barkin, Robert L; Sundaram, Vikram K",Dobry,"A patient with progressively worsening auditory hallucinations and 30-year history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) was reported. To formulate a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment approach to patients with auditory sensory disturbances and other neuropsychiatric sequela of a TBI, an electronic search of the major behavioral science databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline) and a textbook review were conducted to retrieve studies detailing the clinical characteristics, biological mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches to post-TBI psychosis. Additional references were incorporated from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles. Although infrequent, auditory hallucinations is a debilitating complication of TBI that can manifest itself 4-5 years after the occurrence of TBI. Because the age range of TBI survivors is 15-24 years, and the chance of developing post-TBI psychosis is reported to be up to 20%, this chronic neuropsychiatric complication and the available treatment options warrant close scrutiny from the clinical and the biomedical research community. Our case report and literature review demonstrates a clear need for a large, well-designed randomized trials to compare properties and efficacies of different, available, and promising pharmacotherapy agents for the treatment of post-TBI psychosis.",{},,American journal of therapeutics,10.1097/MJT.0b013e31825e3a80,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
