33647851,Auditory agnosia with anosognosia.,"Klarendić, Maja; Gorišek, Veronika R; Granda, Gal; Avsenik, Jernej; Zgonc, Vid; Kojović, Maja",Klarendić,"A 66-year-old right-handed female medical doctor suffered two consecutive cardioembolic strokes, initially affecting the right frontal lobe and the right insula, followed by a lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient presented with distinctive phenomenology of general auditory agnosia with anosognosia for the deficit. She did not understand verbal requests and her answers to oral questions were fluent but unrelated to the topic. However, she was able to correctly answer written questions, name objects, and fluently describe their purpose, which is characteristic for verbal auditory agnosia. She was also unable to recognise environmental sounds or to recognise and repeat any melody. These inabilities represent environmental sound agnosia and amusia, respectively. Surprisingly, she was not aware of the problem, not asking any questions regarding her symptoms, and avoiding discussing her inability to understand spoken language, which is indicative of anosognosia. The deficits in our patient followed a distinct pattern of recovery. The verbal auditory agnosia was the first to resolve, followed by environmental sound agnosia. Amusia persisted the longest. The patient was clinically assessed from the first day of symptom onset and the evolution of symptoms was video documented. We give a detailed account of the patient's behaviour and provide results of audiological and neuropsychological evaluations. We discuss the anatomy of auditory agnosia and anosognosia relevant to the case. This case study may serve to better understand auditory agnosia in clinical settings. It is important to distinguish auditory agnosia from Wernicke's aphasia, because use of written language may enable normal communication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.12.025,,Amusia; Anosognosia; Auditory agnosia; Environmental sound agnosia; Verbal auditory agnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng
9533994,Effortful echolalia.,"Hadano, K; Nakamura, H; Hamanaka, T",Hadano,"We report three cases of effortful echolalia in patients with cerebral infarction. The clinical picture of speech disturbance is associated with Type 1 Transcortical Motor Aphasia (TCMA, Goldstein, 1915). The patients always spoke nonfluently with loss of speech initiative, dysarthria, dysprosody, agrammatism, and increased effort and were unable to repeat sentences longer than those containing four or six words. In conversation, they first repeated a few words spoken to them, and then produced self initiated speech. The initial repetition as well as the subsequent self initiated speech, which were realized equally laboriously, can be regarded as mitigated echolalia (Pick, 1924). They were always aware of their own echolalia and tried to control it without effect. These cases demonstrate that neither the ability to repeat nor fluent speech are always necessary for echolalia. The possibility that a lesion in the left medial frontal lobe, including the supplementary motor area, plays an important role in effortful echolalia is discussed.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70737-8,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Dissociations in stroke patients.,"Vignolo, Luigi A",Vignolo,"A review and an experimental study were carried out in search of dissociations between the recognition of music (music agnosia) and that of environmental sounds (auditory agnosia) in stroke patients. The review focused on 45 adequately studied cases published since 1883. The experimental study consisted of administering standard tests of music and environmental sound recognition to 40 unselected patients with unilateral stroke. Among case reports, music was selectively impaired more frequently than environmental sounds, whereas the reverse occurred in the experimental study. In this, right hemisphere lesions tended either to disrupt the apperception of environmental sounds, sparing music entirely, or to disrupt both environmental sounds and melody, sparing rhythm, whereas left hemisphere lesions tended to spare melody and to disrupt rhythm, either selectively or in association with the semantic identification of environmental sounds.",{},,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,10.1196/annals.1284.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

34612817,Musicogenic epilepsy in paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: a video-EEG case report.,"Morano, Alessandra; Orlando, Biagio; Fanella, Martina; Cerulli Irelli, Emanuele; Colonnese, Claudio; Quarato, Pierpaolo; Giallonardo, Anna Teresa; Di Bonaventura, Carlo",Morano,"Musicogenic epilepsy (ME), a peculiar form of reflex epilepsy, represents a neurological rarity and yet another demonstration of the extraordinary power of music on the human brain. Despite the heterogeneity of the reported musical triggers, patients' emotional response to music is thought to play a crucial role in provoking seizures. Accordingly, the mesial temporal structures (especially of the non-dominant hemisphere) appear most involved in seizure generation, although a more complex fronto-temporal epileptogenic network was documented in some cases. Autoimmune encephalitis has been recently included among the many possible aetiologies of ME based on a few reports of music-induced seizures in patients with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies. Here, we describe the case of a 25-year-old man, educated in music over a long period of time, who had suffered from drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy following seronegative limbic encephalitis related to non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Along with spontaneous events, the patient also developed musicogenic seizures later in the disease course. After detecting five music-induced episodes via 24-hour ambulatory EEG, we performed prolonged video-EEG monitoring during which the patient presented a right temporal seizure (characterized by déjà-vu, piloerection and gustatory hallucinations) while listening to a hard rock song through headphones (which he had not previously heard). This observation allowed us to confirm the provoking effect of the music on our patient's seizures, despite the lack of any emotional drive, which suggests that a ""cognitive"" trigger was more likely in this case. Our report further highlights that autoimmune encephalitis should be investigated as a novel potential cause of musicogenic epilepsy, regardless of autoantibody status.",{},,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,10.1684/epd.2021.1322,,autoimmune epilepsy; musicogenic seizures; paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis; video-EEG,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe a case of a 50-year-old man who presented with acute speech difficulties, headache and focal seizures followed by well-formed visual hallucinations, and later, musical hallucinations of mainstream popular music. MRI of the brain demonstrated right temporal lobe changes with corresponding epileptiform activity seen on electroencephalogram. Subsequently, IgLON5 antibodies were detected in the serum. The patient was treated with anticonvulsants, as well as azathioprine with a tapering oral prednisone course with a complete resolution of the symptoms. Our case demonstrates an unusual presentation of the rare but increasingly described anti-IgLON5 disease, with musical hallucinations.

The patient specializes in music and music technology and has composed scores for films. An awake surgery was planned in a semiseated position. Prerecorded melodies were designed preoperatively as a surrogate for a composition skill task. These consisted of 10- to 15-second musical clips played during bipolar electrical stimulation of the overlying cortex and were divided into three segments: listen, play, and accuracy check. During the ""listen"" phase, the patient listened to a musical prompt. During the ""play"" phase, he played a musical response on a keyboard. Stimulation at multiple temporal neocortical sites was negative for any alteration in task performance. The patient did well postoperatively with excellent clinical and radiographic results and returned to composing music without functional compromise. Musical composition tasks can be performed safely intraoperatively for patients with musical expertise. Whether stimulating more posterior nondominant temporal neocortex or other cortical or white matter locations can disrupt this task remains undetermined.",{},,Neurosurgical focus,10.3171/2023.11.FOCUS23600,,amusia; awake craniotomy; glioma; intraoperative mapping; nondominant hemisphere,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Yet, how music is instantiated within the brain is not fully characterized. Singing is a peculiar aspect of music, in which both musical and linguistic skills are required to provide a merged vocal output. Identifying the neural correlates of this process is relevant for both clinical and research purposes. An adult white man with a presumed left temporal glioma was studied. He is a professional opera singer. A tailored music evaluation, the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia, was performed preoperatively and postoperatively, with long-term follow-up. Intraoperative stimulation mapping (ISM) with awake surgery with a specific music evaluation battery was used to identify and preserve the cortical and subcortical structures subserving music, along with standard motor-sensory and language mapping. A total resection of a grade I glioma was achieved. The Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia reported an improvement in musical scores after the surgery. ISM consistently elicited several types of errors in the superior temporal gyrus and, to a lesser extent, in the inferior frontal operculum. Most errors occurred during score reading; fewer errors were elicited during the assessment of rhythm. No spontaneous errors were recorded. These areas did not overlap with eloquent sites for counting or naming. ISM and a tailored music battery enabled better characterization of a specific network within the brain subserving score reading independently from speech with long-term clinical impact.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.06.130,,Brain; Glioma; Intraoperative stimulation mapping; Music,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
25684297,Joseph Haydn's encephalopathy: new aspects.,"Blahak, Christian; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Hennerici, Michael G",Blahak,"With increasing age, Joseph Haydn complained of progressive forgetfulness preventing him from composing for about the last 8 years of his life. He spent his days more and more inactive and immobilized, suffering from a disabling gait disturbance. Still, most biographers consider diffuse atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure to be reasons for Haydn's medical condition and physical decline during the last years of his life. A more sophisticated and detailed inspection of documents and sources, however, leads to the diagnosis of subcortical vascular encephalopathy (SVE), caused by progressive cerebral small vessel disease. Important features of the disease are mood changes, urinary symptoms, and in particular a characteristic gait disturbance, while dementia is only mild and occurs later in the course. Haydn was severely disabled by the symptoms of SVE for several years and often reported difficulties in the completion of his last oratorio ""Die Jahreszeiten"" (The Seasons). Subsequently, the disease prevented him from composing another large oratorio, ""Das jüngste Gericht"" (The last judgement), which had been already drafted. Finally, the progress of SVE stopped his long career as a composer and conductor at the age of 73 years.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Progress in brain research,10.1016/bs.pbr.2014.11.013,,Haydn; depression; dyspraxia; emotional lability; gait disorder; lacunar strokes; small vessel disease; subcortical vascular encephalopathy; white matter lesions,Biography; Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Portrait,Netherlands,eng

24561388,Selective preservation of the beat in apperceptive music agnosia: a case study.,"Baird, Amee D; Walker, David G; Biggs, Vivien; Robinson, Gail A",Baird,"Music perception involves processing of melodic, temporal and emotional dimensions that have been found to dissociate in healthy individuals and after brain injury. Two components of the temporal dimension have been distinguished, namely rhythm and metre. We describe an 18 year old male musician 'JM' who showed apperceptive music agnosia with selectively preserved metre perception, and impaired recognition of sad and peaceful music relative to age and music experience matched controls after resection of a right temporoparietal tumour. Two months post-surgery JM underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation including assessment of his music perception abilities using the Montreal Battery for Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA, Peretz, Champod, & Hyde, 2003). He also completed several experimental tasks to explore his ability to recognise famous songs and melodies, emotions portrayed by music and a broader range of environmental sounds. Five age-, gender-, education- and musical experienced-matched controls were administered the same experimental tasks. JM showed selective preservation of metre perception, with impaired performances compared to controls and scoring below the 5% cut-off on all MBEA subtests, except for the metric condition. He could identify his favourite songs and environmental sounds. He showed impaired recognition of sad and peaceful emotions portrayed in music relative to controls but intact ability to identify happy and scary music. This case study contributes to the scarce literature documenting a dissociation between rhythmic and metric processing, and the rare observation of selectively preserved metric interpretation in the context of apperceptive music agnosia. It supports the notion that the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) plays a role in metric processing and provides the novel observation that selectively preserved metre is sufficient to identify happy and scary, but not sad or peaceful emotions portrayed in music.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.01.005,,Apperceptive amusia; Metre; Music; Neuropsychology; Temporal processing,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

17166525,Cortical networks of procedural learning: evidence from cerebellar damage.,"Torriero, Sara; Oliveri, Massimiliano; Koch, Giacomo; Lo Gerfo, Emanuele; Salerno, Silvia; Petrosini, Laura; Caltagirone, Carlo",Torriero,"The lateral cerebellum plays a critical role in procedural learning that goes beyond the strict motor control functions attributed to it. Patients with cerebellar damage show marked impairment in the acquisition of procedures, as revealed by their performance on the serial reaction time task (SRTT). Here we present the case of a patient affected by ischemic damage involving the left cerebellum who showed a selective deficit in procedural learning while performing the SRTT with the left hand. The deficit recovered when the cortical excitability of an extensive network involving both cerebellar hemispheres and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was decreased by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Although inhibition of the right DLPFC or a control fronto-parietal region did not modify the patient's performance, inhibition of the right (unaffected) cerebellum and the left DLPFC markedly improved task performance. These findings could be explained by the modulation of a set of inhibitory and excitatory connections between the lateral cerebellum and the contralateral prefrontal area induced by rTMS. The presence of left cerebellar damage is likely associated with a reduced excitatory drive from sub-cortical left cerebellar nuclei towards the right DLPFC, causing reduced excitability of the right DLPFC and, conversely, unbalanced activation of the left DLPFC. Inhibition of the left DLPFC would reduce the unbalancing of cortical activation, thus explaining the observed selective recovery of procedural memory.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.10.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The neuropsychologic findings and neuroanatomic features of the magnetic resonance imaging study were analyzed to try to understand the high degree of recovery of both long-term memory and musical processing abilities in this musician. This case reveals the possibility of an unusual degree of cerebral plasticity and reorganization. Additionally, it emphasizes the question of musical virtuosity.

7397483,Music and language: musical alexia and agraphia.,"Brust, J C",Brust,"Two aphasic right-handed professional musicians with left hemispheric lesions had disturbed musical function, especially musical alexia and agraphia. In Case 1 aphasia was of transcortical sensory type, with severe agraphia and decreased comprehension of written words, although she could match them with pictures. Except for reading and writing, musical ability was normal; she could sing in five languages. Musical alexia and agraphia affected pitch symbols more than rhythm. Case 2 had conduction aphasia and severe expressive amusia, especially for rhythm. Although his language alexia and agraphia were milder than Case 1's, his musical alexia and agraphia were more severe, affecting rhythm as much as pitch. In neither patient were those aspects of musical notation either closest to verbal language or most dependent upon temporal (sequential) processing maximally impaired. These cases are consistent with the literature in suggesting that the presence or absence of aphasia or of right or left hemispheric damage fails to predict the presence, type, or severity of amusia, including musical alexia and agraphia. The popular notion that receptive amusia follows lesions of the language-dominant temporal lobe, whereas expressive amusia follows non-dominant frontal lobe damage, is an over-simplification, as is the view that increasing musical sophistication causes a shift of musical processing from the right hemisphere to the left.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.2.367,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Their causation can be classified as associated with either psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, or organic disorders, such as epilepsy or sensorineural deafness. Non-epileptic musical hallucinosis due to lesions of the central auditory pathway, especially of the thalamocortical auditory radiation, is rare. We describe the case of an 85-year old ethnic Chinese woman with a history of transient ischemic attacks and chronic bilateral hearing impairment, who experienced an acute onset of left unilateral musical hallucinations. Our patient did not experience any psychiatric symptoms and there was no other neurological deficit. Pure tone audiometry revealed bilateral hypacusis and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right non-dominant hemisphere sublenticular lacunar infarct of the thalamocortical auditory radiation.

The intactness of her speech provided strong evidence that the right hemisphere played a major role in her linguistic processing. Data from functional magnetic resonance imaging while she was singing a familiar song, a scale, and reciting lyrics indicated that perilesional residual activation in the left hemisphere was associated with poor pitch production, while right hemispheric activation was involved in linguistic processing. The localization of infarction more anterior to the left Sylvian fissure might be related to the dominant deficits in expressive aspects of the singing of the patient. Compromised motor programming producing a single tone may have made a major contribution to her poor singing. Imperfect auditory feedback due to borderline perceptual ability or improper audio-motor associations might also have played a role.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2016.01.003,,Acquired amusia; Intact speech; Left hemisphere lesion; Subarachnoid bleeding; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In Expts. 1 to 3, subjects were required to judge on a 10-point scale whether the excerpts were happy or sad. Altogether the results show that emotional judgments are (a) highly consistent across subjects and resistant to brain damage; (b) determined by musical structure (mode and tempo); and (c) immediate. Experiments 4 to 6 were designed to asses whether emotional and non-emotional judgments reflect the operations of a single perceptual analysis system. To this aim, we searched for evidence of dissociation in our brain-damaged patient, I.R., by using tasks that do not require emotional interpretation. These non-emotional tasks were a 'same-different' classification task (Expt. 4), error detection tasks (Expt. 5A,B) and a change monitoring task (Expt. 6).

Here, we describe striking gains of function in a patient with primary progressive aphasia, a degenerative disease of the human language network. During the decade before her language deficits arose, Anne Adams (AA), a lifelong scientist, developed an intense drive to produce visual art. Paintings from AA's artistic peak revealed her capacity to create expressive transmodal art, such as renderings of music in paint, which may have reflected an increased subjective relatedness among internal perceptual and conceptual images. AA became fascinated with Maurice Ravel, the French composer who also suffered from a progressive aphasia, and painted his best-known work, 'Boléro', by translating its musical elements into visual form. Later paintings, achieved when AA was nearly mute, moved towards increasing photographic realism, perhaps because visual representations came to dominate AA's mental landscape during this phase of her illness. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that, despite severe degeneration of left inferior frontal-insular, temporal and striatal regions, AA showed increased grey matter volume and hyperperfusion in right posterior neocortical areas implicated in heteromodal and polysensory integration. The findings suggest that structural and functional enhancements in non-dominant posterior neocortex may give rise to specific forms of visual creativity that can be liberated by dominant inferior frontal cortex injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awm270,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",England,eng

Various myths embellish his various biographies. This is also true for his pathography: several articles written by authors from various specialties suggested him having suffered from psychiatric diseases, like cyclothymia or mania, and rheumatologic disorders, like arthritis, while others tended to interpret his recurrent palsies as typical sequelae of ischemic strokes. More recently, reports proposing lead poisoning as the main source of disease in Händel gained the attention of musical and lay press. During his last years of life, Händel was struck with blindness, which in his era had been interpreted as being due to cataracts. This led to three ""coucher"" operations, all of them without any lasting effect. Although a definite diagnosis cannot be proven from the original sources, the most plausible explanation for Händel's palsies and visual impairment may be based on one single context, i.e., cerebrovascular disease.

Our aim was to investigate music compared with verbal evoked autobiographical memories. Five patients with severe ABI and matched controls completed the experimental music (MEAM) task (a written questionnaire) while listening to 50 ""Number 1 Songs of the Year"" (from 1960 to 2010). Patients also completed the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI) and a standard neuropsychological assessment. With the exception of Case 5, who reported no MEAMs and no autobiographical incidents on the AMI and who also had impaired pitch perception, the range of frequency and type of MEAMs in patients was broadly in keeping with their matched controls. The relative preservation of MEAMs in four cases was particularly noteworthy given their impaired verbal and/or visual anterograde memory, and in three cases, autobiographical memory impairment. The majority of MEAMs in both cases and matched controls were of a person/people or a period of life. In three patients music was more efficient at evoking autobiographical memories than the AMI verbal prompts. This is the first study of MEAMs after ABI. The findings suggest that music is an effective stimulus for eliciting autobiographical memories, and may be beneficial in the rehabilitation of autobiographical amnesia, but only in patients without a fundamental deficit in autobiographical recall memory and intact pitch perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2013.858642,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

(4) Music notation can be usefully read by interpreting it acoustically, kinaesthetically or in terms of formal musical concepts; in contrast to written language, it need not be interpreted referentially or in terms of auditory-verbal images.

In the theory of music, the melody and harmony determine to which tonality the music belongs. It remains an unsettled question whether the tonality is also an independent component of the perception of music, or a by-product of the melody and harmony. We describe a patient with auditory agnosia and expressive amusia that developed after a bilateral infarction of the temporal lobes. We carried out a detailed examination of musical ability in the patient and in control subjects. Comparing with a control population, we identified the following impairments in music perception: (a) discrimination of familiar melodies; (b) discrimination of unfamiliar phrases, and (c) discrimination of isolated chords. His performance in pitch discrimination and tonality were within normal limits. Although intrasubject statistical analysis revealed significant difference only between tonality task and unfamiliar phrase performance, comparison with control subjects suggested a dissociation between a preserved tonality analysis and impairment of perception of melody and chords. By comparing the results of our patient with those in the literature, we may say that there is a double dissociation between the tonality and the other components. Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose that tonality is an independent component of music perception.

Based on these observations it was also suggested that singing might improve speech production. However, recent experimental studies with aphasic patients found no evidence to illustrate that singing improves word production under controlled experimental conditions. This study investigated the role of singing during repetition of word phrases in a patient severely affected with non-fluent aphasia (GS) who had an almost complete lesion of the left hemisphere. GS showed a pronounced increase in the number of correctly reproduced words during singing as compared to speaking excerpts of familiar lyrics. This dissociation between singing and speaking was not seen for novel song lyrics, regardless of whether these were coupled with an unfamiliar, a familiar, or a spontaneously generated melody during the singing conditions. These findings propose that singing might help word phrase production in at least some cases of severe expressive aphasia.

He underwent an awake craniotomy and tailored resection of lateral neocortex as well as amygdalohippocampectomy under guidance of cortical stimulation and clinical monitoring. The superior temporal gyrus where activation was revealed on task-based fMRI was preserved. At 16-month follow-up, there was no seizure recurrence and his cognitive functions including musical abilities did not deteriorate with surgery. The task-based fMRI while listening to music revealed bilateral frontotemporal activation. There was evidence of increased left frontotemporal connectivity during the postsurgical period in the resting state fMRI. It is hypothesized that the intact neuropsychological and musical abilities might be as a result of intense musical training from an early age despite the illness leading to functional and neural adaptation of the brain might have contributed to his preserved cognitive functions and musical skills. Intense musical training at a young age perhaps not only honed a range of cognitive functions but also resulted in functionally more efficient cognitive networks despite the surgical resection.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2016.1198815,,Cognition; awake craniotomy; cortical stimulation; drug resistant epilepsy; functional MRI; music; resting state fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

She presented with impairment of musical perception that was especially pronounced in discriminating timbre and loudness but also in discriminating pitch, and a severely impaired ability to reproduce the pitch just presented. In contrast, language and motor disturbances were almost entirely absent. By comparing her pre- and post-stroke singing, we were able to show that her singing after the stroke lacked the fine control of the subtle stress and pitch changes that characterized her pre-stroke singing. Such impairment could not be explained by the impairment of pitch perception. The findings suggest that damage to the right temporoparietal cortex is enough to produce both perceptive and expressive deficits in music.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.013,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Recognition and production of single tones and random tone sequences were found to be surprisingly well preserved. In contrast, the recognition and production of simple rhythm patterns were grossly disturbed. It is suggested that amusia is due to the demonstrated rhythm disturbance. Moreover, it has been found that the defect in recognition and reproduction of rhythms was manifested regardless of the modality of perception, i.e. whether rhythm patterns were perceived by audition, vision, or touch. Therefore, the disturbance of rhythm abilities is supramodal in nature, based probably on the perception of time microintervals. Thus, this type of amusia is a result of a non-auditory supramodal defect, i.e., an impairment of temporal pattern recognition.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(80)80070-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Although the alexia extended to musical notes, he could interpret other musical symbols (e.g., treble clef). Appreciation of rhythm and expressive musical ability were relatively preserved, although judgment of other musical features (including discrimination of pitch, duration, and loudness) was compromised.

For example, musicians with severe anterograde amnesia have demonstrated preserved ability to play musical instruments. However, the question of whether amnesic musicians can learn how to play new musical material despite severe memory impairment has not been thoroughly investigated. We capitalized on a rare opportunity to address this question. Patient S.Z., an amateur musician (tenor saxophone), has extensive bilateral damage to his medial temporal lobes following herpes simplex encephalitis, resulting in a severe anterograde amnesia. We tested S.Z.'s capacity to learn new unfamiliar songs by sight-reading following three months of biweekly practices. Performances were recorded and were then evaluated by a professional saxophonist. S.Z. demonstrated significant improvement in his ability to read and play new music, despite his inability to recognize any of the songs at a declarative level.

A crucial exception to this living vs nonliving rule involves the category of musical instruments. Patients with problems naming living objects often repeatedly fail to name musical instruments. In CSA it is crucial to equate living and nonliving object lists on object name frequency, complexity, and familiarity. The present study shows, however, that even the most rigorously controlled object lists can lead to erroneous conclusions if nonliving stimuli contain an overrepresentation of musical instruments. Naming capabilities of a herpes encephalitis patient were assessed using matched lists of living and nonliving objects and showed no indication of category-specific deficits. When exemplars were separated into biological objects, musical instruments and man-made artifacts, strong category-specificity emerged: artifact naming was flawless whereas musical instrument and biological object naming were both severely impaired.

The mean number of words produced under the spoken and sung conditions did not differ significantly in either experiment. The mean number of notes produced was not different either in the sung-to-la and sung conditions, but was higher than the words produced, hence showing a dissociation between C.C.'s musical and verbal productions.

Having previously demonstrated that JG has a dense, pervasive amnesia for autobiographical material, famous people and famous events (Miller et al. , 2001), in this study, we show that he is unable to access information about unique entities across a range of domains. In contrast, his memory for more general semantic knowledge (such as word meanings) is intact. JG's memory impairment is discussed in the context of a model of neural functioning put forward by Damasio (1990), in which it was proposed that recall of unique entities depends on many cortical regions being activated in synchrony. This activity, thought to be triggered and coordinated by anterior temporal and frontal lobe regions is, in turn, modulated by projections from the thalamus. We propose that JG's thalamic lesion has disrupted the coordination of the diffuse cortical networks necessary to generate highly specific memories from the past, be they episodic or semantic.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.6.504.29375,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article,England,eng

H.J. is a right-handed, amateur male musician who acquired arrhythmia in the context of a global amusia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct. His rhythmic disturbance was analysed in relation to three independent components using an autoregressive extension of Wing and Kristofferson's model of rhythmic timing. This revealed preserved error-correction and motor implementation capacities, but a gross disturbance of H.J.'s central timing system (""cognitive clock""). It rendered him unable to generate a steady pulse, prevented adequate discrimination and reproduction of novel metrical rhythms, and partly contributed to bi-manual co-ordination difficulties in his instrumental performance. The findings are considered in relation to the essential components of the cognitive architecture of rhythmic function, and their respective cerebral lateralisation and localisation. Overall, the data suggested that the functioning of the right temporal auditory cortex is fundamental to 'keeping the beat' in music.

Also, she exhibited a supramodal defect in the perception and reproduction of rhythm, which was rate-dependent. These and other findings led to the following conclusions: the auditory modality is much more dependent on temporal resolution than other sensory modalities; for a full understanding of the mechanism of pure word deafness, not only the defect of temporal resolution but also many other factors, for example, defective discrimination of loudness, pitch or tone duration have to be taken into consideration; and rhythm sense strongly depends on a supramodal capacity of temporal resolution.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/110.2.381,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

CT scan demonstrated bilateral temporal lobe lesions, predominantly on the left side where it extended into the adjacent parietal and frontal lobes. Audiometry suggested integrity of the internal ear and brain stem. Early auditory evoked potentials were present, while potentials of moderate latency and delayed potentials were abolished. Neuropsychological investigations demonstrated total absence of spoken language, contrasting with conservation of written language, though with agrammatism and an impossibility of identifying non-verbal noises, spoken language, and music. The patient could not identify rhythms, pitch, melodies or the different types of music. The musical quality of sound stimuli and musical pleasure were, however spared as shown by recognition of tape recorded sound stimuli with written denomination and designation of images in multiple choice tests. The relations between auditory agnosia, ""pure"" verbal deafness and cortical deafness are discussed. Reported cases are reviewed and an attempt is made to demonstrate the existence of several levels in the integration of musical stimuli, the most elementary of which could be the perception of the musical quality of sounds, as was the case in the present patient.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Single-case methodology was used to evaluate the effectiveness of contingent reinforcement in promoting head posture in an adult brain-injured male. A microswitch was implanted within a headband worn by the subject, attached to a portable radio and positioned such that correct head posture operated the switch, completed the electric circuit and activated the music. The target behaviour was defined as the percentage of time in a walking programme where correct head posture was maintained. The experimental procedure incorporated an A-BC-B-BC-A design and represented the following phases: (A) baseline; (BC) headband + music and (B) headband, no music. A follow-up assessment was also undertaken 1 month later. Overall, statistical analysis revealed a significant increase in the target behaviour and that this improvement was directly contingent on the provision of music inforcement. Results are discussed in further detail and the clinical significance of this finding, over and above the statistical significance, is highlighted in terms of this individual's rehabilitation.",{},,Brain injury,10.3109/02699059109008099,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Prosodic discrimination was assessed with sentence pairs where members of a pair differed by intonation or rhythm, and musical discrimination was tested using musical-phrase pairs derived from the prosody of the sentence pairs. This novel technique was chosen to make task demands as comparable as possible across domains. One amusic subject showed good performance on both linguistic and musical discrimination tasks, while the other had difficulty with both tasks. In both subjects, level of performance was statistically similar across domains, suggesting shared neural resource for prosody and music. Further tests suggested that prosody and music may overlap in the processes used to maintain auditory patterns in working memory.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1997.1862,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

To describe the musical's abilities preserved in a patient with amnesic syndrome and discuss possible neuropsychological and neurobiological bases implicated. A 28-years-old woman presenting with amnesic syndrome is reported. Following a carbon monoxide encephalophaty and subsequent hypoxia she remained in coma for 10 days with evidence of bilateral temporal changes, mainly affecting basal ganglia areas. The patient showed anterograde amnesia and semantic memory impairment, with disproportionately spared musical abilities' performance, either music perception (discrimination and recognition of tonal melodies, musical sight-reading) or music production (song and instrumental performance) or musical memory. This case suggests that the music require elaborate bihemispheric processing and may implicate different forms of information processing. The neural network involved in musical memory can be different that the declarative memory systems (episodic and semantic).",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

A case report and an attempt of neuropsychological qualification (author's transl)].,"Ulrich, G",Ulrich,"Proceeding from the neuropsychological examination of a patient with an exceptionally selective impairment of auditory gnosis of vascular origin, we make an attempt to analyze structurally the syndrome of auditory agnosia, a study of which has been neglected in comparison with analyses of visual agnosia. In our analysis we refer to 28 case reports, documented in the literature. Decisive syndromal points of view are: a) there is an absence of significant audiological deficiencies; b) errors of the acoustic-discriminative type prevail in auditory-visual matching tasks; c) the gnostic deficit is modality specific; d) the same items are variably reproduced on repeated presentation; e) there is marked fluctuation of performance; f) there is exceptional irreversibility of the impairment; g) amusia is a more or less obligatory accompanying phenomenon; h) in cases of vascular origin there is always a history of repeated temporal lobe damage, this damage being predominantly in the form of bilateral lesions. This analysis indicates a close structural analogy to the syndrome of perceptive visual agnosia.

Verbal alexia-agraphia without musical alexia-agraphia in braille].,"Signoret, J L; van Eeckhout, P; Poncet, M; Castaigne, P",Signoret,"A 77 year old right handed male was blind since the age of 2. He presented with an infarction involving the territory of the left middle cerebral artery involving the temporal and the inferior parietal lobes. He had learned to read and write language as well as read and write music in braille, ultimately becoming a famous organist and composer. There were no motor or sensory deficits. Wernicke's aphasia with jargonaphasia, major difficulty in repetition, anomia and a significant comprehension deficit without word deafness was present; verbal alexia and agraphia in braille were also present. There was no evidence of amusia. He could execute in an exemplary fashion pieces of music for the organ in his repertory as well as improvise. All his musical capabilities: transposition, modulation, harmony, rythm, were preserved. The musical notation in braille remained intact: he could read by touch and play unfamiliar scores, he could also read and sing the musical notes, he could copy and write a score. Nine months after the stroke his aphasia remained unchanged. Nevertheless he composed pieces for the organ which were published. Such data highly suggest the independence of linguistic and musical competences, defined as the analysis and organization of sounds according to the rules of music. This independence in an extremely talented musician leads to a discussion of the role of the right hemisphere in the anatomical-functional processes at the origin of musical competence. The use of braille in which the same constellations of dots correspond either to letters of the alphabet or musical notes supports the independence between language and music.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
18379455,[Amusia and its topic specification].,"Buklina, S B; Skvortsova, V B",Buklina,"A historical development of views on amusia and its clinical phenomenology is reviewed. The authors present a case of atypical amusia in a patient aged 32 years with glioma of the right temporal lobe including the upper temporal gyrus. Amusia was combined with euphoria and disturbances of evaluation of speech intonation. It has been assumed that different mechanisms implicated with different regions of both brain hemispheres may underlie amusia. Sometimes these mechanisms appear to be universal, e.g. disorders of symbolic gnosis in posterior hemisphere lesions, being comorbid with amusia as disturbances in reading music and letter agnosia. In our case, the right temporal lobe lesion, especially with involvement of the upper temporal gyrus, caused specific music agnosia with disturbances of perception of some notes and duration of their phonation or a musical contour of the whole melody. Motor amusia is developed due to additional disturbances of motor and premotor brain functions, with significant contribution of the Broca's speech area.
