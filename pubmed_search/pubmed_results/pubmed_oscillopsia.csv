22551695,Paroxysmal alternating nystagmus.,"Lee, Seong-Joon; Sohn, Sung-Yeon; Kim, Ji Soo; Moon, So Young",Lee,"Paroxysmal reversal of spontaneous nystagmus has rarely been described. Herein, we report recurrent bouts of vertigo and oscillopsia in association with reversed spontaneous nystagmus in a patient with prior surgical resection of the cerebellar vermis due to medulloblastoma and subsequent labyrinthine damage. The symptoms almost completely resolved with carbamazepine. The episodes may be ascribed to paroxysmal reversal of the vestibular asymmetry due to intermittent decompensation by the deficient cerebellum.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.010,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",Netherlands,eng
29927799,Central Visual Oscillopsia: Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Jones, Wallace; Silkworth, William; Dusto, Nathaniel; Pelak, Victoria S; Berliner, Jean; Buard, Isabelle; Kluger, Benzi",Jones,"Here we present a patient with persistent central visual oscillopsia, review the literature on this condition, and report results from an experimental intervention using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. A 57-year-old man reported persistent visual oscillopsia after a traumatic brain injury suffered 20 years earlier. Symptoms were presumed to be of cortical origin given his normal eye movements, eye stability, and peripheral vestibular function. Furthermore, he reported oscillopsia with visual imagery during eye closure. Occipital lesions damaging white matter connections identified on magnetic resonance imaging were suspected to be the cause of his symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the left extrastriate visual motion area V5/MT, to bilateral V5/MT, and to bilateral striate visual area V1. The primary outcome measure was dynamic visual acuity. Secondary outcome measures were gaze stabilization testing and subjective improvement as noted by interviews of the patient. Gaze stabilization and dynamic visual acuity testing revealed no difference between pre- and post-intervention with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The patient reported symptomatic improvement in large-amplitude oscillations that persisted for at least 12 months, but stated that smaller-amplitude oscillations were unchanged. Pathologies associated with central oscillopsia in the literature include neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, stroke, migraine without infarction, and psychological trauma. The patient's reported improvement in large- but not small-amplitude oscillopsia suggests that these symptoms may result from different neurophysiological mechanisms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation did not result in clinically significant improvement, suggesting a need for other strategies to treat this condition.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000151,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
34621574,Oscillopsia following orbitotomy for intracranial tumor resection.,"Goethe, Eric A; Hartford, Juliet; Foroozan, Rod; Patel, Akash J",Goethe,"Oscillopsia is a visual phenomenon in which an individual perceives that their environment is moving when it is in fact stationary. In this report, we describe two patients with pulsatile oscillopsia following orbitocranial approaches for skull base meningioma resection. Two patients, both 42-year-old women, underwent orbitocranial approaches for resection of a right sphenoid wing (Patient 1) and left cavernous sinus (Patient 2) meningioma. Patient 1 underwent uncomplicated resection and was discharged home without neurologic or visual complaints; she presented 8 days later with pulsatile oscillopsia. This was managed expectantly, and MRA revealed no evidence of vascular pathology. She has not required intervention as of most recent follow-up. Patient 2 developed trochlear and trigeminal nerve palsies following resection and developed pulsatile oscillopsia 4 months postoperatively. After patching and corrective lens application, the patient's symptoms had improved by 26 months postoperatively. Oscillopsia is a potential complication following skull base tumor resection about which patients should be aware. Patients may improve with conservative management alone, although the literature describes repair of orbital defects for ocular pulsations in traumatic and with some developmental conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_498_2021,PMC8492429,Meningioma; Orbital osteotomy; Orbitocranial; Orbitopterional; Oscillopsia; Skull base tumors,Case Reports,United States,eng
34974486,New-onset Oscillopsia in a Patient With a History of Pontine Stroke.,"Kabanovski, Anna; Donaldson, Laura; Margolin, Edward",Kabanovski,"A 69-year-old man with a history of pontine hemorrhage 2 years ago noticed binocular vertical diplopia after the stroke. On examination, there was a small-angle incomitant left hyperdeviation that did not fit the 3-step test for fourth nerve palsy and incyclotorsion of the higher eye. On motility testing, there was an obvious pendular nystagmus. Resting tremor of the right hand was noticed on neurological examination. Examination of the oropharynx revealed rhythmic oscillations of the soft palate synchronous with the eye oscillations and hand tremor. These findings established a diagnosis of oculopalatal myoclonus (OPM). Although OPM is a well-described entity, this case is unique because the patient was completely asymptomatic from OPM and did not complain of oscillopsia but was very bothered by vertical diplopia because of skew deviation. It also demonstrates that OPM may coexist with skew deviation because anatomically vestibulo-ocular pathway is close to the triangle of Guillain-Mollaret and patients with lesions in one pathway should be examined for abnormalities in the other. Finally, it reminds us about the importance of monitoring patients with a history of brainstem insults for emergence of synchronous tremors years later and that simple maneuver-like ex/amining oropharynx may provide a clear diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0000000000001461,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here, we present and discuss a case with disabling torsional oscillopsia in one eye only. The patient exhibited (i) spontaneous pendular torsional nystagmus of the left eye and (ii) rhythmic involuntary movements of the soft palate and uvula, consistent with the syndrome of oculopalatal tremor with monocular nystagmus. Brain MRI revealed an infarct of the left dentate nucleus in the cerebellum and, more caudally, a secondary hypertrophic degeneration of the right inferior olivary nucleus. To account for the presence of torsional nystagmus on the eye contralateral to the side of inferior olivary hypertrophy and ipsilateral to the lesioned dentate nucleus, we discuss the hypothesis of a (inferior olivary nucleus-mediated) malfunctioning adaptation of the anterior canal vestibulo-ocular reflex.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Cerebellum (London, England)",10.1007/s12311-023-01626-1,,Dentate nucleus; Guillain-Mollaret triangle; Inferior olivary nucleus; Nystagmus; Oscillopsia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Sequential, bilateral retrobulbar injections of botulinum toxin A were performed. Injections immediately decreased oscillopsia and nystagmus, and improved visual acuities. One to three months following injection, three-dimensional infrared oculography measured a significant 39-100% (P = 0.001) decrease in nystagmus amplitudes at multiple dimensions. This improvement diminished by six months in the right eye but sustained for about one year in the left eye. Over two years, botulinum toxin A injections were performed twice in the left eye and five times in the right eye.

On neurological examination vertical nystagmus, ataxic gait and postural tremor of all four limbs was detected. He died one year after the onset of the symptoms because of a acute exacerbation of his severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Vermis and lower brainstem lesions are considered to be responsible, but the exact mechanism is still controversial. We observed a rare case of spontaneous downbeat nystagmus caused by an infratentorial meningioma. A 50-year-old woman was incidentally diagnosed with infratentorial tumor. Later, she suffered from oscillopsia and the symptom disturbed her daily life especially while driving. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor of approximately 30 mm in diameter at the dorsal midline of the posterior fossa. The tumor was compressing the cerebellar vermis and was apparently responsible for the symptoms that affected her daily life; therefore, we decided to perform tumor removal. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the spontaneous downbeat nystagmus completely disappeared. Vertical nystagmus is a finding that raises suspicion of a central nervous system disorder, and requires detailed examination. In addition, in case of vertical nystagmus because of tumor compression of the vermis, removal of the tumor can be an effective treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.140,,Downbeat nystagmus; Infratentorial meningioma; Vermian compression,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

37486916,Unilateral Pendular Nystagmus in Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Series.,"Vosoughi, Amir R; Barbosa, Natalie Brossard; Micieli, Jonathan; Margolin, Edward",Vosoughi,"Acquired pendular nystagmus is most often seen in patients with demyelinating disease. Although it is often bilateral, rare cases may be monocular. There is paucity of data on the spectrum of clinical presentation, underlying mechanism, and response to treatment in patients with monocular pendular nystagmus. Retrospective case series of patients with monocular pendular nystagmus seen in 2 tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinics between January 2019 and June 2022. All patients underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmological assessment and MRI. We describe 5 patients (3 women) aged 31-49 with monocular pendular nystagmus. All had a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Three patients had horizontal and 2 had vertical pendular nystagmus. The Snellen visual acuity in the eye with pendular nystagmus varied from 20/20 to 20/200. Two patients were asymptomatic and 3 suffered visually debilitating oscillopsia. Treatment response was available for 2 patients, both of which responded well to treatment with memantine. The pendular nystagmus was observed in the eye with worse visual acuity in 4 of 5 cases (80%). Three patients had bilateral pontine lesions, and 2 had unilateral pontine lesion ipsilateral to the side of nystagmus. Monocular pendular nystagmus in adults is seen most often in patients with multiple sclerosis. Asymmetry in brainstem lesions and afferent visual input may be the culprit. Treatment with memantine may result in significant improvement in symptomatic patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0000000000001944,,,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

Unlike most patients with DBN, the flocculus is structurally spared in nonalcoholic Wernicke encephalopathy (nWE) with chronic DBN. The objective was to study the effects of alcohol in nWE. We recorded eye movements of a unique patient with nWE under controlled alcohol consumption who said his oscillopsia disappeared with a few drinks of alcohol. His DBN was markedly diminished by alcohol (by 77.4%), although he remained alert with normal saccades. This striking observation may be caused by the differential effect of alcohol on the perihypoglossal complex and the paramedian tract neurons, which control the level of activity in the flocculus, with opposite (inhibition and excitation, respectively) effects. The finding suggests new ideas about the treatment and pathophysiology of DBN with a structurally intact cerebellum.",{},,Neurology.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense lesions in brainstem and thalamus in T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery-weighted images, quite suggestive of NMOSD. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies, which clinched the diagnosis of seropositive NMOSD. After completion of a course of intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days, her opsoclonus disappeared completely. There was significant improvement in her speech and weakness within the first week of therapy and no objective deficit after day 20 of admission. After one-and-a-half-year follow-up, the patient was maintaining well on rituximab as secondary prophylaxis without any further attack.

23800506,Gravity-dependent nystagmus and inner-ear dysfunction suggest anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarct.,"Shaikh, Aasef G; Miller, Benjamin R; Sundararajan, Sophia; Katirji, Bashar",Shaikh,"Cerebellar lesions may present with gravity-dependent nystagmus, where the direction and velocity of the drifts change with alterations in head position. Two patients had acute onset of hearing loss, vertigo, oscillopsia, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed gravity-dependent nystagmus, unilateral hypoactive vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and hearing loss ipsilateral to the VOR hypofunction. Traditionally, the hypoactive VOR and hearing loss suggest inner-ear dysfunction. Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus may suggest peripheral or central vestibulopathy. The gravity-dependent modulation of nystagmus, however, localizes to the posterior cerebellar vermis. Magnetic resonance imaging in our patients revealed acute cerebellar infarct affecting posterior cerebellar vermis, in the vascular distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). This lesion explains the gravity-dependent nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. Acute onset of unilateral hearing loss and VOR hypofunction could be the manifestation of inner-ear ischemic injury secondary to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) compromise. In cases of combined AICA and PICA infarction, the symptoms of peripheral vestibulopathy might masquerade the central vestibular syndrome and harbor a cerebellar stroke. However, the gravity-dependent nystagmus allows prompt identification of acute cerebellar infarct.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.05.020,,Stroke; dizziness; embolic stroke; posterior circulation; posterior fossa; vertigo,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here, we present a rare case of a brainstem cavernoma that was surgically resected whereafter an upbeat nystagmus presented postoperatively. A 42-year old man presented with sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, vertigo, blurred vision, marked imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Neurological evaluation showed bilateral ataxia, generalized hyperreflexia with left-sided predominance, predominantly horizontal gaze evoked nystagmus on right and left gaze, slight left labial asymmetry, uvula deviation to the right, and tongue deviation to the left. MRI demonstrated a 13-mm cavernoma with haemorrhage and oedema in the medulla oblongata. Surgery was performed via a minimal-invasive, midline approach. Complete excision was confirmed on postoperative MRI. The patient recovered well and became almost neurologically intact. However, he complained of mainly vertical oscillopsia. The videonystagmography revealed a new-onset spontaneous upbeat nystagmus in all gaze directions, not suppressed by fixation. An injury of the rarely described intercalatus nucleus/nucleus of Roller is thought to be the cause. Upbeat nystagmus can be related to several lesions of the brainstem, including the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the pons, and the dorsal medulla. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an iatrogenic lesion of the nucleus intercalatus/nucleus of Roller resulting in an upbeat vertical nystagmus.

CT and MRI revealed bilateral post-ischaemic lesions in the dorsomedial thalamus and the mesodiencephalic junction, dorsomedial to the red nucleus, thus being restricted to the territory of the posterior thalamosubthalamic paramedian artery, which includes the region of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle as the main premotor nucleus for the generation of vertical saccades. In our patients, oculographic examination with electro-oculography and magnetic search coil recording showed severe impairment of downward more than upward saccades and only minor deficits of vertical pursuit and the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Visual functions were normal, with one exception: a psychophysical test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical movements. This could be due to a central adaptive mechanism which, in order to minimize oscillopsia, might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze palsy. As an alternative explanation, lesions within the midbrain tegmentum could have damaged subcortical visual pathways involved in motion perception.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00314736,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Blurry vision was attributed to oscillopsia from downbeat nystagmus, which later evolved into macrosaccadic oscillations. MRI brain and spine showed mild, longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintensity in the central gray matter of the spinal cord extending from the medulla to T11 level. Serum paraneoplastic panel was negative; however, she had very high titers of anti-Ma2 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome was made. Empiric treatment with high dose of intravenous steroids followed by intravenous immunoglobulin infusions did not improve her symptoms. An extensive search for an underlying tumor commenced and was initially unrevealing. However, two-month follow-up positron emission tomography scan showed increased uptake in a right pulmonary nodule, which when biopsied confirmed diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma.

Anti-Ma2 is a well-characterized onconeuronal antibody and one of the causes of PCD. There has been only one previous report of anti-Ma2-associated paraneoplastic syndrome as a complication of HL. Here we present a rare case of anti-Ma2-associated PCD in a patient with nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A 77-year-old man with a 3-month history of gait instability and a 2-month history of oscillopsia was referred to our hospital for further investigation. On examination, his cognition was normal. He had nystagmus in all directions of gaze; specifically, he had horizontal and rotatory nystagmus in the primary position, downbeat nystagmus after right, left, and up gaze, and upbeat nystagmus after down gaze. Although his limb ataxia was mild, his trunk ataxia was so pronounced that he was unable to walk without support. We strongly suspected paraneoplastic syndrome and tested for neuronal autoantibodies. The anti-Ma2 antibody was strongly positive in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid but other antineuronal autoantibodies were negative. Computed tomography showed an enlarged lymph node in the right axilla but no masses. Biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of NLPHL. The NLPHL cells stained with anti-Ma-2 antibody in the cytoplasm, suggesting these abnormal cells contained protein that was cross-reactive with Ma-2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of anti-Ma2-associated PCD in a patient with NLPHL that was confirmed using immunostaining of the lymph node tissue with anti-Ma2 antibody.

Brain ischemia is caused by abnormal flow in the dilated artery and obstruction of paramedian arteries or intraluminal thrombus with artery-to-artery embolism. We report a patient with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and luminal thrombus treated with intravenous urokinase who did well but died 2 months later of subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 60-year-old man developed right-hand clumsiness, dysarthria and ataxia. Computed tomography showed vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and thrombus in the basilar artery. Symptoms quickly resolved on heparin but recurred on warfarin and again resolved on heparin. Two weeks later, while on warfarin and aspirin 325 mg, he developed hand numbness, oscillopsia and ataxia. Symptoms again resolved on heparin. Angiography showed severe dolichoectasia of the distal right vertebral artery and basilar artery. A large mural thrombus was detected in the ventral part of the distal basilar artery narrowing the lumen by 50%. He was treated with intravenous urokinase 4,400 units/kg as a bolus followed by 4,400 units/kg/h for 12 h. Repeat angiography showed almost complete recanalization and improved filling of basilar artery branches. He was maintained on warfarin and aspirin 81 mg and had no further ischemic episodes. He died 2 months later of rupture of the basilar artery and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Some patients with thrombosis of vertebrobasilar dolichoectactic arteries continue to have ischemic symptoms despite adequate anticoagulation.

Three months after the stroke, she was transferred to our hospital for rehabilitation. Approximately 6 months later, she gradually began to complain of the visual oscillation. Continual, unceasing conjugate vertical/rotatory eye movements were observed. Fixation was momentary at best because of an inability to dampen the spontaneous eye movements. Electrooculography (EOG) showed bilateral vertical/rotatory sinusoidal eye movements of 2.5 Hz frequency and 10- to 35-degree amplitude. Both vertical and horizontal optokinetic nystagmus were absent. Caloric stimulation did not evoke any responses bilaterally. There were no rhythmical movements at similar frequencies in other parts of the body such as palatal myoclonus. MRI revealed not only hematoma mainly at the dorsal pontine tegmentum but also hypertrophy of the inferior olive nucleus, suggesting disruption of the central tegmental tract. Lesions of this tract may be one cause of pendular nystagmus. Several drug therapies were investigated for the nystagmus. There was no response to baclofen 15 mg. Trihexyphenidyl 4 mg was discontinued because of drug-induced hallucinations. Tiapride 600 mg and phenobarbital 90 mg were each slightly effective in reducing both frequency and amplitude of nystagmus. Treatment with clonazepam 1 mg resulted in the striking disappearance of nystagmus. She was aware of this and no longer experienced oscillopsia. Despite the visual benefit, however, the patient did not wish to continue this drug because of drowsiness and muscle relaxation. The potential long-term therapeutic application of clonazepam should be further investigated. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of successful treatment in acquired pendular nystagmus with clonazepam. Therefore, based on this favorable experience, it is suggested that clonazepam should be added to the list of potential therapies for pendular nystagmus.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
