34950010,Alice in Wonderland Syndrome-Like Seizure and Refractory Supraventricular Tachycardia.,"Panpruang, Pitirat; Wongwandee, Monton; Rattanajaruskul, Nattapun; Roongsangmanoon, Worawut; Wongsoasu, Arthit; Angkananard, Teeranan",Panpruang,"Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) is a rarely curious visual perceptual disorder which has been associated with diverse neurologic and psychiatric problems. It may be a manifestation in migraine, epileptic seizures, encephalitis, other brain lesions, medication-related side effects, schizophrenia, and depressive disorders. Principal character of AIWS is the disproportion between the external world and the self-image in which micropsia (objects appear smaller), macropsia (objects appear larger), and teleopsia (objects appear further away) are frequently reported. The cases of temporal lobe epilepsy may present with complex visual auras of visual distortions (e.g., micropsia and macropsia) like AIWS. We report an unusual case of an elderly man who presented with AIWS, focal impaired awareness seizures, ictal tachyarrhythmia, multiple episodes of transient visual disturbances of macropsia and transient loss of consciousness. During those symptoms, telemetry showed self-limited supraventricular tachycardia several times which could not be regulated with heart rate-controlled medication. The electroencephalography was later tested and showed rhythmic theta activity over the right cerebral hemisphere. He was treated with levetiracetam, and all his symptoms and tachyarrhythmias were gradually resolved thereafter. Refractory response to treatment would remind the physicians to reassess for the correct diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000519509,PMC8647104,Alice in Wonderland; Macropsia; Seizure; Tachycardia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The condition is relatively rare and unique in its hallucinatory characteristics. OBJECTIVE To discuss the potential pathways involved in AIWS. Interest in this subject arose from a patient seen at our service, in which dysmetropsia of body image was reported by the patient, when she saw it in her son. METHODS We reviewed and discussed the medical literature on reported patients with AIWS, possible anatomical pathways involved and functional imaging studies. RESULTS A complex neural network including the right temporoparietal junction, secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, right posterior insula, and primary and extrastriate visual cortical regions seem to be involved in AIWS to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS AIWS is a very complex condition that typically has been described as isolated cases or series of cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,10.1590/0004-282X20190094,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

33115435,The right thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus seems to be determinant for macrosomatognosia: a case report.,"ElTarhouni, Amir H; Beer, Laura; Mouthon, Michael; Erni, Britt; Aellen, Jerome; Annoni, Jean-Marie; Accolla, Ettore; Dieguez, Sebastian; Chabwine, Joelle N",ElTarhouni,"Macrosomatognosiais the illusory sensation of a substantially enlarged body part. This disorder of the body schema, also called ""Alice in wonderland syndrome"" is still poorly understood and requires careful documentation and analysis of cases. The patient presented here is unique owing to his unusual macrosomatognosia phenomenology, but also given the unreported localization of his most significant lesion in the right thalamus that allowed consistent anatomo-clinical analysis. This 45-years old man presented mainly with long-lasting and quasi-delusional macrosomatognosia associated to sensory deficits, both involving the left upper-body, in the context of a right thalamic ischemic lesion most presumably located in the ventral posterolateral nucleus. Fine-grained probabilistic and deterministic tractography revealed the most eloquent targets of the lesion projections to be the ipsilateral precuneus, superior parietal lobule,but also the right primary somatosensory cortex and, to a lesser extent, the right primary motor cortex. Under stationary neurorehabilitation, the patient slowly improved his symptoms and could be discharged back home and, later on, partially return to work. We discuss deficient neural processing and integration of sensory inputs within the right ventral posterolateral nucleus lesion as possible mechanisms underlying macrosomatognosia in light of observed anatomo-clinical correlations. On the other hand, difficulty to classify this unique constellation of Alice in wonderland syndrome calls for an alternative taxonomy of cognitive and psychic aspects of illusory body-size perceptions.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01970-3,PMC7594440,Alice in wonderland syndrome; Diffusion tractography; Macrosomatognosia; Stroke; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
10071061,Selective horizontal dysmetropsia following prestriate lesion.,"Frassinetti, F; Nichelli, P; di Pellegrino, G",Frassinetti,"We describe a patient (P.S.) who, following a right prestriate lesion, reported that objects in the left visual field appeared distorted and smaller than those on the right. Other aspects of visual processing were remarkably unaffected. We carried out a series of size comparison tests using simple or complex stimuli and requiring different types of behavioural responses. We found that P.S. significantly underestimated the size of stimuli presented in her left visual field. When comparison tasks involved stimuli placed along the vertical axis or in the right visual field, P.S. performed well. The vertical and horizontal components of size distortion were found to be differentially affected. We conclude that size processing may be dissociated from other aspects of visual processing, such as form or colour processing, and depends critically on part of the occipital, prestriate areas (Brodmann areas 18-19).",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/122.2.339,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Symptoms of this syndrome typically include an altered body image, size perception, and time perception. However, the pathophysiology and lesions responsible for this syndrome remain unclear. In most cases, specific lesions cannot be identified using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Two patients with isolated cortical venous thrombosis in the right occipital area experienced transient visual symptoms of AIWS. Furthermore, a literature search indicated that AIWS with visual distortions is associated with right occipital lobe lesions, supporting the findings of our study.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.2169/internalmedicine.2092-23,PMC11309861,Alice in Wonderland syndrome; isolated cortical venous thrombosis; metamorphopsia; occipital lobe; stroke; visual distortion,Journal Article; Case Reports,Japan,eng

26111290,[Phenomenological and Diagnostic Implications of Paraschemazia: A Case Report].,"Mehta, Urvakhsh Meherwan; Thippeswamy, Harish; Bharath, Rose Dawn; Satishcandra, Parthasarathy",Mehta,"Paraschemazia is characterized by distortions of body image, and has been observed in neurological disorders (epilepsies, migraine, and non-dominant cortical lesions), retinal damage, and hallucinogenic drug use. This complex symptom cluster of subjective and objective perceptual abnormalities forms an essential feature of Todd's Alice in Wonderland syndrome. This neuropsychiatric manifestation must be phenomenologically differentiated from hallucinations, illusions, and agnosias. Herein we report a patient with paraschemazia that occurred during the ictal phase of temporal lobe epilepsy; the patient was referred to the department of psychiatry due to symptoms of transient intense fear and abnormal perceptions. We also discuss the diagnostic difficulty and phenomenological implications associated with this rare phenomenon. A 45-year-old female presented with brief episodes (30-45 s) of sensory distortion, during which the faces and limbs of other people and her own appeared distorted (e.g. protruding eyes, elongated nose, and oval or square head). The episodes of sensory distortion were associated with intense fear and were followed by loss of consciousness for 5 min. She had been experiencing these episodes since the age of 12 years and responded poorly to several antiepileptic medications. 3-Tesla MRI performed using a complex partial seizure protocol showed altered signal intensity and volume loss in the right hippocampus, suggestive of right mesial temporal sclerosis. Neuropsychological assessment showed impaired sustained attention, working memory, and verbal and visual learning and memory, suggestive of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal lobe deficits. She improved in response to a combination of levetiracetam and clobazam, and was seizure free at the 2-year follow-up.",{},,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Turkey,tur
38281750,[A case of Alice in Wonderland syndrome after Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encephalitis: a mimicry of focal epileptic seizure].,"Hosokawa, Kyoko; Oi, Kazuki; Hitomi, Takefumi; Mitsueda, Takahiro; Nakagawa, Tomokazu; Ikeda, Akio",Hosokawa,"A 30-year-old man who received infliximab for treatment of Crohn's disease developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encephalitis, which responded well to therapy; however, he had left lower visual field loss following treatment. The patient noticed peculiar symptoms 9 months after recovery from encephalitis; objects in his view appeared smaller or larger than their actual size (micropsia/macropsia). Moreover, it appeared that objects outside moved faster or slower than their actual speed of movements and moving objects appeared as a series of many consecutive snap shots. His vision was blurred, and he had visual difficulties and a sensation that his body was floating. These symptoms mainly appeared following fatigue and persisted over approximately 10 years. Based on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, brain MRI, N-isopropyl-p-<sup>123</sup>I-iodoamphetamine with single photon emission computed tomography, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and electroencephalography, we excluded both recurrent encephalitis and focal epileptic seizures. By taking all symptoms and other evaluation findings into account, the patient most likely suffered from ""Alice in Wonderland syndrome"" which is primarily associated with cortical dysfunction in the right temporo-parieto-occipital area as the consequence of previous acute EBV encephalitis.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001906,,Alice in Wonderland syndrome; Epstein–Barr virus; abnormality of motion vision; macropsia; micropsia,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
