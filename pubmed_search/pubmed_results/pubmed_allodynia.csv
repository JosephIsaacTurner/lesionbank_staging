24596647,Touch me not.,"Karmacharya, Paras; Shah, Kalpana; Pathak, Ranjan; Ghimire, Sushil; Alweis, Richard",Karmacharya,"Central Poststroke Pain syndrome (CPSP) can occur due to disruption of the somatosensory pathways of the brain at any level such as the thalamus, medulla, or cerebral cortex. It is characterized by sensory abnormalities and hyperesthesia in the part of the body correlating to the central lesion. The treatment of this pain syndrome is often difficult, and it does not usually respond to traditional analgesics. The first line of treatment is drugs aimed at lowering neuronal hyperexcitability, for example, amitriptyline or lamotrigine, with gabapentin considered a second line.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,10.3402/jchimp.v4.23148,PMC3937561,Central Poststroke Pain; Déjerine Roussy syndrome; gabapentin; neuropathic pain; thalamic pain syndrome,Case Reports,United States,eng

Approximately one-third of LRPN cases have a trigger. Our purpose is to show that COVID-19 can trigger LRPN. We describe the clinical, neurophysiological, radiologic, and pathologic findings of a 55-year-old man who developed DLRPN after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. Shortly after mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the patient developed severe neuropathic pain (allodynia), postural orthostasis, fatigue, weight loss, and weakness of bilateral lower extremities requiring wheelchair assistance. One month after COVID-19, he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Neurological examination showed bilateral severe proximal and distal lower extremity weakness, absent tendon reflexes, and pan-modality sensation loss. Electrophysiology demonstrated an asymmetric axonal lumbosacral and thoracic radiculoplexus neuropathies. Magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement and T2 hyperintensity of the lumbosacral plexus. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed an elevated protein (138 mg/dL). Right sural nerve biopsy was diagnostic of nerve microvasculitis. He was diagnosed with DLRPN and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g weekly for 12 weeks. The patient had marked improvement in pain, weakness, and lightheadedness and at the 3-month follow-up was walking unassisted.

37292430,Case report: Intracranial and spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dog with Angiostrongylosis.,"Santifort, Koen M; den Toom, Marjolein; Garosi, Laurent; Carrera, Ines",Santifort,"A 1-year-old male intact Staffordshire terrier, born and raised in the Netherlands, was presented with a 3-week history of progressive lethargy and spinal, predominantly cervical, hyperesthesia. Other than hyperthermia and cervical hyperesthesia, general and neurological examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Comprehensive hematological and biochemical tests were considered normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical region revealed heterogeneity of the subarachnoid space, characterized by pre-contrast T1W hyperintensity, corresponding to a T2* signal void. Extending from the caudal cranial fossa to the level of the third thoracic vertebra, there were uneven patchy extra-parenchymal lesions that caused mild spinal cord compression, most marked at the level of C2. At this level, the spinal cord showed an ill-defined hyperintense T2W intramedullary lesion. Mild intracranial and spinal meningeal contrast enhancement was evident on post-contrast T1W images. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected, and further diagnostic tests including Baermann coprology resulted in a diagnosis of hemorrhagic diathesis caused by an <i>Angiostrongylus vasorum</i> infection. The dog rapidly responded to treatment with corticosteroids, analgesic medication, and antiparasitic treatment. Follow-up over 6 months yielded complete clinical remission and repeatedly negative Baermann tests.

It often results from thrombosis or emboli of the vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The triad of Horner's syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia, and ipsilateral hyperalgesia clinically identify patients with LMS. We report a case of a 62-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male who presented with symptoms involving the left lateral dorsal medulla along with partial Horner's syndrome, left lateral rectus palsy, and left lower motor neuron-type facial palsy. Atypical presentation in LMS could be explained by infraction of left facial colliculus in addition to the left lateral medulla.

32807443,Spinal epidural hematoma as a stroke mimic.,"Inatomi, Yuichiro; Nakajima, Makoto; Yonehara, Toshiro",Inatomi,"Spinal epidural hematoma is a rare but important disease as it can be a stroke mimic. Our aim was to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with an activated stroke code and spinal epidural hematoma. Patients with an activated stroke code were examined retrospectively. Patients with spinal epidural hematoma were evaluated with further neurological examinations and neuroimaging. Of 2866 patients with an activated stroke code, spinal epidural hematoma was detected in 5 (0.2%, 63-79 years, 2 men). In all 5 cases, hematoma was located in the unilateral dorsal region of the spinal canal and spread to 5-9 vertebral segments at the C1-T3 level. None of the patients had a medical history of head or neck injury, coagulopathy, or use of anti-thrombotic agents. All of the patients had occipital, neck, and/or back pain, and their hemiparesis occurred simultaneously or within 1 h after the onset of pain. Hyperalgesia ipsilateral to the hematoma was observed in 1 patient, hypoalgesia contralateral to the hematoma was observed in 1, and quadriparesis and bilateral hypoalgesia were observed in 1. The hematomas spontaneously decreased in size in 4 patients, and cervical laminectomy was performed in the other patient. In the 1860 patients with an activated stroke code and spontaneous eye opening, the sensitivity of pain as a predictor of spinal epidural hematoma was 100%, with a specificity of 88.7%, and positive predictive value of 2.3%. Patients with spinal epidural hematoma could present with clinical characteristics mimicking ischemic stroke.

3512953,Septic thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses.,"Southwick, F S; Richardson, E P; Swartz, M N",Southwick,"From 1940 to 1984, 19 cases of septic dural-sinus thrombosis have been diagnosed at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and some 136 cases have been reported from other institutions. Septic thrombosis most frequently involves the cavernous sinuses (96 cases). Facial or sphenoid air sinus infection often precede cavernous-sinus disease. In addition to the classical signs of proptosis, chemosis, and oculomotor paralysis, isolated sixth-nerve palsy and hypo- or hyperesthesia of the fifth nerve may be found. The major pathogens associated with cavernous-sinus infection include Staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive organisms, and anaerobes. Septic lateral-sinus thrombosis (64 cases) is almost exclusively a complication of otitis media and/or mastoid infection. Organisms causing this infection include Proteus species, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and anaerobes. Septic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (23 cases) most frequently accompanies bacterial meningitis or air sinus infection. Causative organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus, other streptococci, and Klebsiella species. Because septic dural-sinus thrombosis is rare, this disease is frequently misdiagnosed. Evaluation should include lumbar puncture, air sinus films, and computed tomographic scan with contrast. Other helpful diagnostic tests may include carotid angiography, and dynamic brain scan. Orbital venography is the most definitive study in cases of chronic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. Therapy should include intravenous antibiotics and early surgical drainage of purulent exudate in the air sinuses or mastoid regions. Retrospective analysis suggests that treatment with heparin may reduce mortality in carefully selected cases of septic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation is not recommended in other forms of septic dural-sinus thrombosis. Mortality in the antibiotic-era remains high, particularly in patients with septic thrombosis of the cavernous (30%) and superior sagittal (78%) sinuses.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/00005792-198603000-00002,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
36582892,Acute dysphagia: A rare initial symptom of lateral medullary syndrome: A case report.,"Ali, Farhan; Zubair, Amraha; Nazir, Fatima; Ali, Kashif; Mansoor, Sobia",Ali,"A unique etiology of stroke, lateral medullary syndrome (LMS), is a consequence of posterior inferior cerebellar artery or vertebral artery thromboembolic conditions. LMS patients present particularly with ipsilateral hyperalgesia, ipsilateral ataxia, and Horner's syndrome. Our case signifies that neurogenic origin should always be considered in the absence of local causes of dysphagia. Early diagnosis could prevent LMS complications, including neurological disabilities. A scarcity of research related to dysphagia in LMS, and its outcomes exists. Therefore, the objective is to investigate the clinical course in a patient afflicted with severe dysphagia following a diagnosis of (LMS). This would encourage further research, thus improving management and treatment strategies. We report a case of a 45-year-old male, a smoker for 20 years, who presented with a single, unique complaint of acute dysphagia for 9 days. According to our knowledge, this is among very few reported cases of LMS with dysphagia being the rare initial complaint. The neurological issues associated with dysphagia gradually improved with the administration of antiplatelet; clopidogrel and lipid-lowering drug; rosuvastatin and the patient was discharged. Atypical presentation in LMS could be supported by the presence of lateral medullary infarct which was confirmed by MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Dysphagia is a common complaint in multiple gastrointestinal (GI) settings. However, in cases where the GI causes are excluded, as described here, diagnosis of LMS becomes tough. The diagnosis of LMS was queried owing to the presentation of the single most important common symptom, with no other characteristic manifestations of LMS.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104851,PMC9793181,Case report; Dysphagia; Posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Stroke; Trauma; Wallenberg syndrome,Case Reports,England,eng

We report the case of a patient presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage after ischemic stroke associated with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome. A 22-year-old man presented with cerebral infarction of the right corona radiata. He had no contributory past or family histories. On imaging at this time, a 4-mm fusiform aneurysm of the right anterior cerebral artery was incidentally detected. Several examinations were performed, but no abnormalities or abnormal lesions were seen on echography or whole-body computed tomography. Blood tests yielded positive results for antinuclear antibody, lupus anticoagulant, and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein І antibody. He presented 70 days later with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed the same fusiform aneurysm without any change in shape and no new aneurysms. The balloon occlusion test was performed without any neurologic symptoms, so the right anterior cerebral artery was trapped using coils. After 6 months, he presented with new optic hyperesthesia and facial butterfly-shaped erythema and fulfilled the criteria for SLE. At 2 years after initial presentation, he showed no recurrence of either aneurysm or ischemic stroke. The patient's first ischemic stroke was induced by antiphospholipid syndrome and underlying SLE. Fusiform aneurysm may have resulted from focal vasculitis, with activation of SLE leading to aneurysm rupture.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.01.030,,Antiphospholipid syndrome; Fusiform aneurysm; Ischemic stroke; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Systemic lupus erythematosus,Case Reports,United States,eng

A middle-aged woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day-history of progressive left arm numbness and weakness, confusion, disorientation and clumsiness worsened by upright position. A cerebral hypoperfusion condition was hypothesized and confirmed by a CT angiography, which showed bilateral internal carotid dissection with uncertain etiology. Screening for predisposing conditions to spontaneous carotid arteries dissection was basically negative. Regarding potential precipitating factors, the patient had used an electric olive harvester days before symptoms onset, without any painful sensation or sudden sequelae. Portable harvesters in olive growing transmit vibrations to the hand-arm system but it remains to be elucidated if hand-arm vibrations can be implicated in vessels wall injury and dissection. Bilateral carotid artery dissection is an infrequent and life-threatening condition which can rarely present with non-specific symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion. The absence of typical symptoms and known precipitating factors can made the diagnosis quite hard to achieve.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Annals of vascular surgery,10.1016/j.avsg.2021.01.090,,,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

There is very little, if any, discussion in the literature of ketamine use in stroke, particularly in improving symptoms of pain after stroke. We present a case of a 40-year-old female with a past medical history of right-sided thalamic ischemic stroke complicated by Central post-stroke pain syndrome (CPSP) presented for refractory severe diffuse pain causing debility and immobility. The patient failed outpatient medical therapy consisting of anxiolytics, serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. This led to increased opioid use which resulted in dependence and opioid-hyperalgesia. Upon admission, the patient was unable to sit still, with severe, sharp 10/10 pain localized to her left lower extremity. Palliative medicine was consulted for management of refractory central neuropathic pain. Inpatient oral ketamine was initiated, and titrated over the patient's hospital course. During this time, the patient showed marked improvement in GAD-7, PHQ-9, and Short Mcgill pain scores while significantly decreasing opioid requirements. We present this case to demonstrate how oral ketamine usage in centrally mediated neuropathic pain such as in CPSP can lead to pain control, decreased opioid usage, and overall improved quality of life.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of palliative medicine,10.21037/apm-20-972,,Central post-stroke pain syndrome (CPSP); case report; ketamine; palliative medicine; thalamic pain syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,China,eng

These dogs underwent anesthesia for MRI and additional diagnostics. The thoracolumbar MRI in Dog 1 revealed an accumulation of T2-weighted (T2W) hyperintense, T1-weighted (T1W) iso- to hyperintense, contrast enhancing extradural material. The differential diagnoses were meningitis with secondary hemorrhage or empyema or late subacute hemorrhage. The initial cervical MRI in Dog 2 revealed T1W meningeal contrast enhancement suspected to be secondary to meningitis. A repeat MRI following neurologic decline after CSF sampling revealed a large area of T2W and T1W hyperintensity between fascial planes of the cervical musculature as well as T2W iso- to hyperintense and T1W iso- to hypointense extradural material at the level of C1 consistent with hemorrhage. The cervical MRI in Dog 3 revealed T2W hyperintense and T1W iso- to hypointense extradural compressive material consistent with hemorrhage. Dogs 1 and 2 underwent CSF sampling and developed complications, including subcutaneous hematoma and vertebral canal hemorrhage. Dog 3 underwent surgical decompression, which revealed a compressive extradural hematoma. In each case, a hemophilia panel including factor VIII concentration confirmed the diagnosis of hemophilia A. Dog 1 had a resolution of clinical signs for ~5 months before being euthanized from gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Dog 2 was euthanized due to neurologic decompensation following CSF sampling. Dog 3 did well for 2 weeks after surgery but was then lost to follow-up. This case series provides information on clinical signs, MRI findings, and outcome in 3 juvenile dogs with hemophilia A that developed neurologic deficits or paraspinal hyperesthesia secondary to spontaneous or iatrogenic vertebral canal hemorrhage. Hemophilia A should be considered as a differential in any young dog presenting with an acute onset of hyperesthesia with or without neurologic deficits.

Neurological examination showed paraplegia without nociception, a mass reflex upon testing perineal reflexes and withdrawal reflexes in the pelvic limbs and patellar hyperreflexia. Cutaneous trunci reflexes were absent caudal to the level of the 6th thoracic vertebra. Spinal hyperesthesia was present. Neuroanatomical localization was consistent with a T3-L3 myelopathy. Hematological and biochemical blood tests [including C-reactive protein (CRP)] were within reference ranges. MRI of the spinal cord from the level of the 1st thoracic vertebra to the sacrum revealed a patchy, ill-defined, moderate to marked T2W hyperintense, contrast enhancing intramedullary lesion extending from T1 to L4. Medical treatment based on a working diagnosis of meningomyelitis of unknown cause was initiated with corticosteroids and methadone based on pain scores. Prognosis was grave and after 3 days without return of nociception, the dog was euthanized according to the owners' wishes. Post-mortem histopathological examination of the brain and spinal cord yielded a morphological diagnosis of severe, segmental, bilateral and fairly symmetrical, necrotizing lymphohistiocytic leukomyelitis, with a non-suppurative angiocentric leptomeningitis. Some minor, focal, lymphocytic perivascular cuffing was found in the medulla oblongata as well, but otherwise there were no signs of brain involvement.

We report the clinical features, neuroradiological imagings, and management of a case of trigeminal neurinoma located in the cerebellopontine angle, arising from the Vth cranial nerve root, presenting with an atypical trigeminal neuralgia; moreover, we analyze similar cases reported in the literature and we discuss whether pain can be produced by a neurinoma that arises central to the ganglion. The tumor presented with an atypical trigeminal neuralgia characterized by constant trigeminal pain with paroxystical burns, hyperesthesia and hyperactive autonomic dysfunction. Neuroradiological examinations provided the best preoperative localization of this lesion, allowing better planning of the surgical approach, considering the large size of this tumor. A retromastoid incision and posterior fossa craniectomy approach was used, with complete excision of the tumor. The paraxysmal sharp pain and hyperesthesia disappeared completely, but the constant burning pain persisted although it was less intense. At an 8-month follow-up examination, the patient showed a progressive improvement of clinical symptoms and control magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the complete removal of the neoplasm and the absence of residuals or recurrences.

32443341,Isolated involvement of corpus callosum in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy with concomitant peripheral neuropathy: A case report.,"Peng, Qing; You, Qian; Zhang, Jing; Liu, Shui",Peng,"Metronidazole is widely used for treating infection of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Metronidazole is generally well tolerated, although metronidazole-associated peripheral neuropathy (PN) and metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (MIE) have been reported as rare side effects. The most common sites of MIE involve the bilateral dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. Herein, we present a rare case of MIE with isolated corpus callosum involvement, with concomitant metronidazole-associated PN. A middle-aged man with ulcerative colitis was diagnosed with amoebic dysentery because of unhygienic eating. After receiving metronidazole (1.8 g/d, cumulative dose 61.2 g) for >1 month, he started to complain of continuous paresthesia of the limbs, and intermittent speech problems. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an isolated lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. A diagnosis of reversible splenial lesion syndrome and PN was made. Given the patient's medical history, MIE and metronidazole-associated PN were considered. Metronidazole was stopped. Mecobalamine and vitamin B1 were used for adjuvant treatment. At 1.5 months after stopping metronidazole, his symptoms of numbness and hyperesthesia had not improved, although he felt less ill.

We present a case of central post-stroke pain associated with dystonia. Both conditions were successfully treated with a single deep brain stimulation (DBS) operation. A 60-year-old female suffered a right posterior cerebral artery stroke following emergent clipping of a ruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm resulting in central post-stroke pain. This manifested as delayed left face and hemibody allodynia and hyperesthesia. The patient also developed marked left-sided dystonia. These progressive symptoms were disabling and refractory to conservative management. The patient underwent a single-stage DBS surgery with stereotactic targeting and implantation of two leads. One lead was placed in the right-sided ventral capsule/ventral striatum for treatment of pain and a second lead in the right-sided globus pallidus interna for treatment of dystonia. The surgical implantation proceeded without complication. The patient's dystonia markedly improved following surgery. While her pain improved, she required multiple, meticulous programing sessions to achieve significant pain relief and decrease in pain medication use. Overall, the patient was satisfied with the results of her intervention. She did, however, have occasional intermittent spells of severe pain on top of her residual discomfort throughout her treatment course. Unfortunately, she died from small cell lung carcinoma a year after her DBS surgery. Deep brain stimulation targeting multiple brain networks in one operation is feasible and safe. Deep brain stimulation may be considered in some refractory cases of central post-stroke pain; however, it requires meticulous programming.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2018.01.036,,Globus pallidus; Neuromodulation; Programming; Ventral capsule/ventral striatum,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.195,,Central post-stroke pain; Intermittent stimulation; Spinal cord stimulation; Thalamic pain,Case Reports,United States,eng

This study aimed to summarize the clinical features to enhance our understanding of anti-GlyR antibody-related disease. By collecting clinical information from admitted patients positive for glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody, the clinical characteristics of a new patient positive for GlyR antibody were reported in this study. To obtain additional information regarding anti-GlyR antibody-linked illness, clinical data and findings on both newly reported instances in this study and previously published cases were merged and analyzed. A new case of anti-GlyR antibody-related progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) was identified in this study. A 20-year-old man with only positive cerebrospinal fluid anti-GlyR antibody had a good prognosis with first-line immunotherapy. The literature review indicated that the common clinical manifestations of anti-GlyR antibody-related disease included PERM or stiff-person syndrome (SPS) (n = 179, 50.1%), epileptic seizure (n = 94, 26.3%), and other neurological disorders (n = 84, 24.5%). Other neurological issues included demyelination, inflammation, cerebellar ataxia and movement disorders, encephalitis, acute psychosis, cognitive impairment or dementia, celiac disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain and allodynia, steroid-responsive deafness, hemiballism/tics, laryngeal dystonia, and generalized weakness included respiratory muscles. The group of PERM/SPS exhibited a better response to immunotherapy than others. The findings suggest the presence of multiple clinical phenotypes in anti-GlyR antibody-related disease.

Pathogenetically, it is considered to be a continuum of these two types of pain after becoming chronic. Repetitive peripheral painful stimulation causes a central sensitization with hypersensitivity of the corresponding spinal metamer or brain region. Therefore, signs of altered nociception, such as allodynia, may be found on the tissues of the related dermatome, myotome and sclerotome, and characterize nociplastic pain. This kind of pain was found in over 20% of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Nociplastic pain may be an amplifier of spasticity, the main pyramidal symptom that affects about 80% of pwMS.

A 32-year-male presented with an unusual case of Wallenberg's syndrome due to a dissecting aneurysm of the PICA manifesting as a sensation of heaviness in the occipital region and vertigo. The occipital symptoms persisted and vertigo and vomiting developed after 6 days. Numbness developed on the left side of the patient's face, and hyperalgesia on the right side of the body. The diagnosis of Wallenberg's syndrome was based on the above findings. MRI revealed infarction of the lateral aspect of the medulla oblongata and MR angiography revealed dilatation in the proximal portion of the left PICA. Digital subtraction angiography revealed that the left vertebral artery was essentially normal, but there was a spindle-shaped dilatation in the proximal portion of the left PICA. We carried out conservative therapy at the patient's request and 3D-CTA revealed that the dissecting aneurysm was markedly reduced in size seven months after the onset. Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial posterior circulation have been shown to be less uncommon than previously thought. However, those involving the PICA without involvement of the vertebral artery at all are extremely rare. The natural history of the dissecting PICA aneurysm was unknown, and the indication for surgical treatment of such aneurysms remains controversial. Management options are conservative treatment, open surgical treatment including wrapping, trapping, and resection with reconstruction, but almost all of the patients underwent radical treatment to prevent rupture of the aneurysm. However we had no knowledge of the risk of rupture of a PICA dissecting aneurysm presenting with ischemic symptoms.

The case reported here suggests that thalamic lesions may also cause crying spells, under the special circumstances described below. After a mild left thalamic stroke a caucasian 77 years old man presented with crying spells with no emotional counterpart, triggered by thumb-index rubbing of his right hand. Only a modest sensation loss on right infra-orbital and nose-labial areas and the first three right fingers could be detected at clinical examination. The circumstances and processes leading to the crying spells were investigated, together with their neural substrate. Brain computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. Neurophysiologic studies included Video-Electroencephalography, Electromyography, motor and sensory Evoked potentials. Active thumb-index rubbing, passive fingertips stimulation and interaction of sensory-motor stimulation with cognitive/speech activities were tested under different paradigms. A treatment with pregabalin (75 mg twice a day) was attempted. CT and MRI showed a small ischemic infarct in the left ventral postero-lateral thalamus, while fMRI led to the expected findings, i.e. a bilateral activation of the hand motor representation during the crying-triggering right-hand finger rubbing activity. Sensory potentials evoked from stimulation of the right upper limb were the only abnormal neurophysiologic test. Crying spells could be invariably evoked by both real and imagined active finger rubbing, in either the left of right hemi-space. Rubbing by an examiner was ineffective. Immersion in water (18 °C) but not oiling of the fingertips prevented the symptom. Administration and discontinuation of pregabalin 75 mg daily could be associated with suppression and reappearance of the symptom, respectively. In this patient loss of sensation seemed to generate crying spells rather than the more common allodynia. As a matter of speculation, both symptoms might represent responses to a sensory loss, but in this case the pathway might have been selectively affected providing inhibition from the lateral to the medial segment of the VPLT, which is linked to the anterior cingulate (limbic) cortex engaged in emotional behaviour.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,BMC research notes,10.1186/s13104-017-2425-z,PMC5326498,Case report; Cerebrovascular disease; Crying; Stroke; Thalamus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To this end, the patients under study are divided into three groups. In the first group, called ""reflex sympathetic dystrophy"" (RSD), the syndrome can be characterized by a triad of autonomic, motor, and sensory symptoms, which occur in a distally generalized distribution. The pain is typically felt deeply and diffusely, has an orthostatic component, and is suppressed by the ischemia test. Under those circumstances, the pain is likely to respond to sympatholytic interventions. In a second group, called ""sympathetically maintained pain"" (SMP) syndrome, the principal symptoms are spontaneous pain, which is felt superficially and has no orthostatic component, and allodynia. These symptoms, typically confined to the zone of a lesioned nerve, may also be relieved by sympathetic blocks. Since the characteristics of the pain differ between RSD and SMP, the underlying kind of sympathetic-sensory coupling may also vary between these cases. A very small third group of patients exhibits symptoms of both RSD and SMP. The dependence or independence of pain on sympathetic function reported in most published studies seems to be questionable because the degree of technical success of the block remains uncertain. Therefore, pain should not be reported as sympathetic function independent until the criteria for a complete sympathetic block have been established and satisfied.",{},,The Behavioral and brain sciences,10.1017/s0140525x97271487,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Paraesthesias were reported by 41%, radiation of stimuli by 50%, after-sensations by 45% and allodynia by 23%. Vibration sensibility was abnormal in 41%; raised thresholds to the perception of touch were found in 52%, to 2-PD in 35%, to dermolexia in 45% and to joint movements in 37%. The results indicate that all patients with CPSP have lesions that affect the major pathways for temperature and pain sensibility, i.e., the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways. Furthermore it appears that neither the level of the lesion along the neuraxis nor concomitant injury to the medial lemniscal pathways is crucial for the development of CPSP. The results confirm the notion that CPSP is a deafferentation syndrome, but they also provide evidence against the hypothesis that CPSP is a release phenomenon caused by a lesion that removes inhibitory influences of the lemniscal pathways on neurones that evoke pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(89)90128-0,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
35530898,A Rare Case of Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-Associated Transverse Myelitis in a 40-Year-Old Patient With COVID-19.,"Doukas, Sotirios G; Santos, Andrea P; Mir, Waleed; Daud, Sarosh; Zivin-Tutela, Tracy H",Doukas,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) includes an extensive spectrum of clinical manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 often exhibits central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, including encephalitis, meningitis, and spinal cord pathologies. To date, few cases of COVID-19-associated transverse myelitis (TM) have been described. A 40-year-old unvaccinated man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department complaining of fever, worsening burning sensation in his lower extremities, unsteady gait, and difficulty initiating urination for five days. Twelve days before presentation, the patient had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physical examination revealed hyperesthesia, starting around the nipple line (T4) and extending distally, involving the lower extremities, accompanied by symmetric weakness in the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine with and without contrast revealed mild intramedullary signal abnormality at T3-T4 and T6-T8, confirming the suspicion of TM. Further laboratory testing revealed a C-reactive protein level of 67 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase level of 181 mg/L, serum B12 level of 781 pg/mL, methylmalonic acid level of 165 nmol/L, folate of >24.5 ng/mL, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.481 μIU/L. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a cell count of 14 cells/µL, with 69% lymphocytes, glucose level of 81 mg/dL, protein level of 32 mg/dL, and negative cultures. Human immunodeficiency virus, antinuclear antibody screening, anti-DNA, rapid plasma reagin, Lyme serology, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies were unremarkable. Serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G was negative, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies were positive. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and oral gabapentin and was discharged after five days when his urinary retention improved. Most previously reported cases of COVID-19-related TM were negative for autoimmune workup. Although the exact pathophysiology of COVID-19-related TM remains unclear, one hypothesis suggests that it is a consequence of the direct viral invasion. However, our patient had MOG antibodies, suggesting the possible involvement of a different mechanism. In MOG-associated TM, it has been suggested that MOG antibodies gain access to the CNS through disruption of the blood-brain barrier. This unique presentation demonstrates that further studies are needed to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the immune and nervous systems. It also highlights that young and otherwise healthy patients are at risk of severe COVID-19-related complications, including CNS disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.23877,PMC9074907,acute transverse myelitis (atm); covid-19; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog); myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody; sars-cov-2,Case Reports,United States,eng
18853944,Post-stroke tactile allodynia and its modulation by vestibular stimulation: a MEG case study.,"McGeoch, P D; Williams, L E; Song, T; Lee, R R; Huang, M; Ramachandran, V S",McGeoch,"There is behavioural evidence that caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) can alleviate central pain. Several such patients have also noted that it reduces tactile allodynia, an especially ill-understood phenomenon in these patients. The first aim is to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study neural activity associated with tactile allodynia in central post-stroke pain (CPSP). The second is to assess how this would be affected, if at all, by CVS. The third is to assess the ability of the VESTAL solution for MEG to detect anterior cingulate activation. A 58-year-old woman with CPSP, and marked unilateral tactile allodynia, participated in a MEG study with imaging pre- and post-CVS. Tactile simulation within the patient's allodynic area resulted in contralateral activation of the primary motor and anterior cingulate cortices, which had normalized 24 h post-CVS. We suggest that the unexpected primary motor cortex activation in response to light touch in the allodynic area arises from inappropriate activation of a normal mechanism, which may occur when a threat to homeostasis is present, to lower motor thresholds and allow for more rapid performance of corrective actions. We propose this may be mediated by the interoceptive cortex in the dorsal posterior insula.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01106.x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Denmark,eng

Similar to NMO/NMOSD associated with AQP4 antibodies, preceding infections have been reported in patients with MOG antibody-positive ON. This is the first report of bilateral ON following a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection associated with a positive MOG antibody. A 41-year-old man who initially presented with genital herpes developed allodynia in the Th2-Th5 and Th8-L2 areas, urinary retention, and painful visual loss in the left eye. Ophthalmological evaluation and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral ON. A spinal MRI showed leptomeningeal enhancement from the thoracic to lumbar vertebrae and abnormal enhancement of the L3 to S3 dorsal root ganglia without a change in intramedullary signals. Following treatment with acyclovir and steroid pulse, he fully recovered. Serum anti-AQP4 antibodies were negative, but anti-MOG antibodies were positive. Finally, he was diagnosed with MOG antibody-positive bilateral ON and meningoganglionitis following an HSV infection. Our case supports a relationship between anti-MOG antibodies and ON triggered by an HSV infection. Clinicians should thus consider testing for MOG antibodies in patients with post-infectious neurological symptoms due to an HSV infection.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2017.07.023,,Herpes simplex virus; Meningitis; Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody; Optic neuritis; Urinary retention,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
32241253,Abdominal pain due to the spinothalamic tract injury in patients with mild traumatic brain injury: a case report.,"Jang, Sung Ho; Kwon, Young Hyeon; Lee, Sung Jun",Jang,"We report on a patient with a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who developed abdominal pain due to spinothalamic tract (STT) injuries revealed by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). A 53-year-old female patient suffered head trauma resulting from a backward fall. While bathing at a public bathhouse, she fell backward and struck the occipital area of her head against the floor. After the head trauma, she experienced pain in the abdomen and in both hands and feet. She underwent evaluations including conventional brain MRI, abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography, and stomach and intestine endoscopy. No abnormality was observed in her brain or abdomen. In addition, her abdominal pain had not been relieved by medical management. When she came to our hospital 4 years after the head trauma, her pain characteristics and severity were as follows: intermittent pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia; squeezing and warm creeping-like pain in the abdomen (visual analog scale score: 7); tingling pain in both hands and feet (visual analog scale score: 7). She was prescribed pregabalin and gabapentin, and her abdominal and limb pain was well-controlled at a tolerable level. On DTT 4 years after head trauma, the upper portion of the spinothalamic tracts (STTs) in both hemispheres showed partial tearing. Injury of the STT was demonstrated by using DTT in a patient who showed abdominal pain that was refractory to medical management following mild TBI. Our results suggest that central pain due to STT injury might be suspected in patients with abdominal pain that is refractory to medical management following TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01695-3,PMC7119278,Brain injury; Diffusion tensor tractography; Head trauma; Spinothalamic tract; Traumatic axonal injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Of the five patients, two had CPSP with hyperpathia following a stroke (with a lesion on CT scan involving the thalamo-cortical pathway in one and involving the thalamus in the other); two had CPSP following a stroke in the middle cerebral artery area, without hyperpathia; and the last patient suffered pain from algodystrophia following a fracture of the wrist. In the two cases with hyperpathia, SPECT demonstrated a contralateral relative hyperactivity in a central region corresponding to the thalamic area. This was not observed in the three other patients. In the two patients with hyperpathia, a second SPECT scan with stimulation of the contralateral pain-free arm did not demonstrate any hyperactivity in the thalamic area. These results suggest that a thalamic neuronal hyperactivity may characterize some hyperpathic syndromes and, in accordance with our previous results obtained in the rat, that the loss of inhibition on medial thalamic neurons may be a main feature of hyperpathia following certain cerebral stroke syndromes.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(91)90224-L,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
30732149,Headache due to spinothalamic tract injury in patients with mild traumatic brain injury: Two case reports.,"Jang, Sung Ho; Seo, You Sung",Jang,"Headache is the most common physical complaint reported by the following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Several studies using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) have demonstrated that injury of the spinothalamic tract (STT) is a pathogenetic mechanism of central pain following TBI. However, no study of headache due to injury of the STT has been reported. Patient 1 was a 52-year-old female who suffered head trauma resulting from an in-car traffic crash. While sitting in a passenger seat in a moving vehicle, another vehicle suddenly hit the car from the right side. Her head hit the door and she suffered a flexion-hyperextension-rotation injury. She began to feel headaches in both fronto-parieto-occipital areas approximately 2 weeks after the crash. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and intermittent stabbing pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia (visual analogue scale score: 7). Patient 2 was a 50-year-old male who suffered head trauma from a flexion-hyperextension injury that occurred after being hit from behind by a vehicle while driving his car. He began to feel headache in both fronto-parieto-occipital areas the day after the crash: constant tingling pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia (visual analogue scale score: 6). The patient 1 was diagnosed as mild TBI due to head flexion-hyperextension-rotation injury. The patient 2 was diagnosed as mild TBI due to head flexion-hyperextension injury. Clinical assessment and DTT were performed at 5 months (patient 1) and 10 months (patient 2) after the initial injury. On DTTs of patient 1 and 2, the STTs showed narrowing in both hemispheres. In addition, discontinuations at the subcortical white matter were observed in both hemispheres in patient 2. Headache due to injury of the STT was diagnosed in patients with mild TBI. Precise diagnosis of central pain from other types of pain is clinically important because the management of central pain is quite different from those for other types of pain. Our results suggest that headache might be ascribed to the injury of the STT in patients with mild TBI. Therefore, we recommend evaluation of the STT using DTT in patients with mild TBI who complain of headache having the characteristics of neuropathic pain.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000014306,PMC6380840,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, few studies have been reported about delayed-onset CPSP due to degeneration of the STT following a stroke. A 57-year-old female patient presented with right hemiparesis after stroke. Two weeks after onset, she did not report any pain. At approximately 6 months after onset, she reported pain in the right arm and leg, and the pain slowly intensified with the passage of time. At 14 months after onset, the characteristics and severity of her pain were assessed to be continuous pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia; tingling and cold-sensational pain in her right whole arm and leg (visual analog scale score: 5). The patient was diagnosed as the right hemiparesis due to spontaneous thalamic hemorrhage. Clinical assessment and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed 2 weeks and 14 months after onset. She suffered continuous pain in her right whole arm and leg (visual analog scale score: 5). On DTT of the 2-week postonset DTI scans, the configuration of the STT was well-preserved in both hemispheres. However, in contrast to those 2-week postonset results, the 14-month postonset DTT results showed partial tearing and thinning in the left STT. Regardless, both the 2-week and 14-month postonset DTT showed that the left STT passed through the vicinity of the thalamic lesion.

11098380,Hemihyperaesthesia and hyperresponsiveness resembling central pain syndrome in a dog with a forebrain oligodendroglioma.,"Holland, C T; Charles, J A; Smith, S H; Cortaville, P E",Holland,"A 4-year-old male Boxer was presented with neurological signs referable to a right forebrain lesion that was confirmed with computed tomography. Whilst characteristic signs of a unilateral forebrain lesion were observed, the dominant and striking finding was a right-sided hemisensory disturbance characterised by hyperaesthesia and hyperresponsiveness. Necropsy revealed a gelatinous mass confined to the right forebrain that was identified histologically as an oligodendroglioma. The lesion was centred on the internal capsule and involved ventral frontal and temporal lobes and the ventrolateral thalamus, including lateral and medial parts of the ventrocaudal nuclear region (ventrobasilar complex) of the thalamus. On clinical and neuroanatomical grounds, the case exhibited features in common with central pain syndrome in human patients with thalamic lesions. These included a somatosensory disorder of hyperaesthesia affecting an entire side of the head and body, behavioural manifestations consistent with spontaneous pain and a lesion involving the ventrobasilar complex. Of interest, the hemisensory abnormality was ipsilateral to the lesion, contrasting with central pain in humans, in which clinical signs are contralateral to analogous lesions. It is suggested that species-specific differences in spinal cord organisation of pain pathways, particularly the greater bilateral projection of nociceptive afferents to thalamic relay nuclei in carnivores, may account for this disparity. Notably, central pain is rare in human patients with brain tumours, even those affecting the thalamus, and this may also be the case in dogs.",{},,Australian veterinary journal,10.1111/j.1751-0813.2000.tb10402.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
23264319,Transdermal buprenorphine controls central neuropathic pain.,"Weiner, Michelle; Sarantopoulos, Constantine; Gordon, Eva",Weiner,"A 53-year-old male with peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage resulting in right hemiparesis and hemisensory loss. Three months later, he developed constant and burning pain within the entire right side of his body. He was diagnosed with central pain syndrome and treated with antiepileptics and tricyclic antidepressants. Minimal analgesia was achieved, which was limited by intractable sedation and drowsiness. Patient was then treated with oral opioids (morphine and hydrocodone with acetaminophen) in escalating doses that produced cognitive impairment. After an opioid rotation was attempted, by switching morphine to transdermal fentanyl, there was no pain reduction or improved quality of life. A trial of buprenorphine was initiated, by administering transdermal patches in escalating doses in weekly intervals. Patient's pain was eventually successfully controlled with buprenorphine patch 60 μg/h every 7 days. His self-reported Visual Analogue Scale pain scores decreased from an average of 8/10 to 2/10 or less. Patient's overall function and participation in home activities increased. Buprenorphine is a partial μ-receptor and a κ-δ receptor antagonist known to block NMDA receptors and reduce hyperalgesia secondary to central sensitization.(1) Buprenorphine is also a partial agonist at the opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor, which is found to be analgesic and antinociceptive at the level of the spinal cord.(1,2) The difference in analgesic responses between buprenorphine and other opioids may be due to different receptor G protein interactions and/or selective activation of neuronal K(ATP) channels by buprenorphine.(3) Deficient opening of K(ATP) channels has been shown to mediate neuropathic pain(4); therefore, activation of these channels by buprenorphine may contribute to its analgesic effect in neuropathic pain states wherein other opioids fail. More recently, there have been two case reports in which patients with neuropathic pain of different central etiology were successfully treated with buprenorphine.(5) Despite advances in understanding the pathology related to central pain, effective treatment options are limited. Buprenorphine may be an analgesic option for central pain management when opioids fail to reduce hypersensitivity or when patients exhibit intolerable side effects to other medications.",{},,Journal of opioid management,10.5055/jom.2012.0141,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
9272783,A longitudinal study of somesthetic perceptual disorders in an individual with a unilateral thalamic lesion.,"Greenspan, J D; Joy, S E; McGillis, S L; Checkosky, C M; Bolanowski, S J",Greenspan,"Several aspects of tactile, thermal and pain perception were evaluated in an individual (R.S.) with a hemorrhagic lesion centered in her left lateral thalamus. Over a 4-year period, psychophysical evaluations were undertaken every 6-8 months, and five magnetic resonance (MR) studies were conducted. Early tests (1991-1992) revealed large contralateral deficits in R.S.'s perception of touch, innocuous temperature, and mechanically evoked cutaneous pain--more so for the upper versus the lower extremity. R.S. showed a similar pattern for heat pain sensitivity, but a more modest deficit than for mechanically evoked pain. She showed a deficit for cold pain sensitivity on her foot, but not for her hand. Thresholds for all types of stimuli ipsilateral to the lesion were within a normative range. Late in 1993, R.S. demonstrated improvements in sensory capacity for touch and mechanically evoked pain contralaterally, although deficits were still evident. During the same period, heat pain sensitivity improved contralaterally, and strikingly, a permanent, ipsilateral hypersensitivity to heat pain developed in her hand. Throughout the entire testing period, R.S.'s ratings of perceived unpleasantness matched the patterns of perceived pain intensity. Thus, the discriminative and the affective dimensions of her pain would change in tandem. However, perceptible innocuous thermal stimuli evoked no affective response when applied contralaterally, despite being described as pleasant when presented ipsilaterally. Throughout the testing period, R.S. reported a persistent numbness on her right hemi-body. Only during a 3-month period in 1995 did she experience spontaneous pain, which was referred to her right foot. The only change in psychophysical performance related to her right foot was a transient but intense thermal allodynia several months prior to her spontaneous pain. The MR studies over this 4-year period showed changes in the extent of edema, gliosis and/or ischemia that could be related to perceptual changes. Thus, the conspicuous observations in this thalamic lesion case were: (i) differential effects upon the various pain modalities (mechanical, heat and cold); (ii) development of thermal allodynia without mechanical allodynia, including an ipsilateral effect; (iii) a deficit in positive affective responses to temperature; and (iv) the different time courses for changes in evoked somesthetic capacity versus spontaneous paresthesias and pathological pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/s0304-3959(97)03378-2,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Acute central pain is mainly associated with parietal, thalamic, and brainstem lesions.

Unfortunately, there are few publications concerning long term follow up of patients with these types of injuries. We present a case of trans-orbital penetrating brain injury with an 18 year follow up. A 43-year-old, previously healthy, male was accidently impaled on a fencing foil resulting in a penetrating brain injury. Initial symptoms included diplopia, ophthalmoparesis, a non-reactive pupil, decreased visual acuity, decreased sensation across the cheek, dysphagia and dysarthria. CT scan taken on presentation showed a clear tract of the foil traversing the various structures of the brain. One week after the trauma, the patient developed a unique constellation of paroxysmal attacks of autonomic dysfunction consisting of profuse diaphoresis and decreased skin temperature on the left side of the body, as well as dilation of the left pupil. Three months after the accident, the patient suddenly experienced severe constant pain affecting the left side of his body associated with thermal and tactile allodynia. On latest follow up, 18 years after the accident, the patient continues to have chronic pain, allodynia, and lack of temperature sensation throughout the left face, arm, and leg. He has a wide based, hemi-ataxic gait, with the left leg swinging out and around. EMG and nerve conduction studies have found no voluntary activity in the temporalis and masseter muscles resulting in atrophy and fibrosis. An MRI shows linear encephalomalacia along the path of the foil extending to the pons, involving the right spinothalamic tract, and cerebellum. Our case illustrates the importance of such a longitudinal follow up. It demonstrates the possible severity of the sequelae from these types of injuries including chronic pain and gait ataxia, as well as EOM and autonomic dysfunction.

A new method based on multispectral fluorescence (MFL) imaging of indocyanine green (ICG) video angiography (VA) allows real-time, augmented reality (AR) visualization of blood flow superimposed on white-light microscopic images. We describe our single-center experience using MFL AR in cerebrovascular surgery. Case descriptions are provided of cerebrovascular surgery with intraoperative use of MFL AR images performed at our institution from June 2018 to April 2020. MFL superimposes the blood flow in real time on white-light microscopic images. We used MFL AR imaging as well as standard ICG-VA visualization and intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as a control. A total of 39 cases (33 aneurysm clippings, 4 arteriovenous malformations, and 2 external carotid-internal carotid bypass surgeries), were performed using MFL technology-based AR visualization of ICG. MFL AR imaging and DSA showed a high correlation concerning aneurysm occlusion and vessel patency. In arteriovenous malformation resection surgery, MFL AR imaging facilitated early identification of the feeding arteries and draining veins. Because of increased sensitivity of MFL AR, a reduced dose of ICG could be used, allowing repeated intraoperative imaging. There were no postoperative complications, side effects, or technical problems related to the use of MFL AR imaging. MFL AR is an easy-to-use adjunct in cerebrovascular surgery and shows a high correlation with intraoperative DSA. No interruption of the surgery is necessary because MFL AR images of the blood flow are superimposed in real time on white-light microscopic images.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.03.157,,Aneurysm; Arteriovenous malformation; Augmented reality fluorescence; Cerebrovascular surgery; Multispectral fluorescence; Vascular neurosurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here we present two patients in whom increased pain sensation (hyperalgesia) to laser stimuli was, on the contrary, associated to delayed, desynchronized and attenuated LEPs. Both patients experienced increased unpleasantness and affective reactions to laser, associated to poor ability to localize the stimulus. In both cases the results may be explained by an overactivation of the 'medial pain system', in one patient due to deafferentation of cortical sensory areas by a capsular lesion, and in the other to imbalance between A-delta and C fiber excitation due to peripheral nerve injury. Our results suggest that LEPs, as currently recorded, reflect the activity of a 'lateral' pain system subserved by rapidly conducting fibers. They may therefore, assess the sensory and cognitive dimensions of pain, but may not index adequately the affective-emotional aspects of pain sensation conveyed by the 'medial' pain system. The dissociation between pain sensation and cortical EPs deserve to be added to the current semiology of LEPs, as the presence of abnormal pain to laser on the background of reduced LEPs substantiates the neuropathic nature of the pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/s0304-3959(98)00206-1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
3877248,[Role of the lemniscal system in pain modulation--a consideration based on clinical experience].,"Namba, S",Namba,"Ten patients with intractable pain of central origin were operated on for pain relief by implanting the chronic stimulating electrode (Medtronic Co.) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamic sensory nuclei or mesencephalic lemniscus medialis, and the results were briefly described. Localization of the lesion demonstrated by CT was projected on the Schaltenbrand & Bailey's atlas in each of these patients and the deep brain structure involved was identified. The lesions were located mainly in the posterolateral thalamus including posteromedial part of the internal capsule (thalamic pain), however, they were located outside of the thalamus in some cases (suprathalamic pain). Two particular patients were described in detail because clinical courses, especially operative results were esteemed to be suggestive of an important role of lemniscal system in pain modulation. A 48-year-old man (Case 7) developed severe spontaneous burning pain on the right half of the body after extensive putaminal hemorrhage. Stimulation of the posterior limb of the internal capsule or of the thalamic sensory relay nuclei elicited no pain relief. Consequently a lesion was stereotaxically made in the most medial portion of the lemniscus medialis of the rostral mesencephalon. This operative procedure provoked previously unrecognized significant dysesthesia and hyperpathia predominantly of the extremities as well as aggravation of hypesthesia and hypalgesia. The second patient (Case 8) was a 44-year-old man who developed dysesthesia, hyperpathia and spontaneous pain of the left hand and face after hemorrhage in the right sensory cortex. Stimulation of the mesencephalic lemniscus medialis of the right side elicited comfortable warm sensation in contralateral upper half of the body including hand, fingers and face with simultaneous diminution of pain. These two cases were suggestive of the role of lemniscus medialis in pain modulation. Blockade of the lemniscus medialis elicited, and its facilitation inhibited the pain. Lemniscal and extralemniscal (spinothalamic) system have been proven to be intermingled in the thalamic and suprathalamic levels. Though both of the systems might be involved in the manifestation of central pain including our present ten cases, it was discussed and postulated that the facilitation of the lemniscal system might inhibit the activity of spinothalamic system, thus resulting in pain relief.",{},,No shinkei geka.

P40m dipoles calculated from magnetoencephalographic fields after electrical stimulation of both tibial nerves were localized in SI as is seen in normal subjects. However, stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large N80m component, best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate cortex. This early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral Abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal projection.

The first patient had a right hemibody pain secondary to a left parietal infarct sparing the thalamus, while the second patient had left lower limb pain developed after a right mesencephalic infarct. In both cases, spontaneous pain was associated with hyperpathia, allodynia and hypoaesthesia in the painful territory involving both lemniscal and extra-lemniscal sensory modalities in patient 1, extra-lemniscal sensory modality only in patient 2. Both patients were treated with electrical PGS by means of a 4-pole electrode, the central sulcus being per-operatively located using the phase-reversal of the N20 wave of somatosensory evoked potentials. No sensory side effect, abnormal movement or epileptic seizure were observed during PGS. The analgesic effects were somatotopically distributed according to the localization of electrode on motor cortex. A satisfactory long-lasting pain control (60-70% on visual analog scale) as well as attenuation of nociceptive reflexes were obtained during PGS in the first patient. Pain relief was less marked and only transient (2 months) in patient 2, in spite of a similar operative procedure. In this patient, in whom PGS eventually evoked painful dysethesiae, no attenuation of nociceptive RIII reflex could be evidenced during PGS. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied using emission tomography (PET) with O-labeled water. The sites of CBF increase during PGS were the same in both patients, namely the thalamus ipsilateral to PGS, cingulate gyrus, orbito-frontal cortex and brainstem. CBF increase in brainstem structures was greater and lasted longer in patient 1 while patient 2 showed a greater CBF increase in orbito-frontal and cingular regions. Our results suggest that PGS-induced analgesia is somatotopically mediated and does not require the integrity of somatosensory cortex and lemniscal system. PGS analgesic efficacy may be mainly related to increased synaptic activity in the thalamus and brainstem while changes in cingulate gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex may be rather related to attentional and/or emotional processes. The inhibitory control on pain would involve thalamic and/or brainstem relays on descending pathways down to the spinal cord segments, leading to a depression of nociceptive reflexes. Painful dysesthesiae during stimulation have to be distinguished from other innocuous sensory side effects, since they may compromise PGS efficacy.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(94)00211-V,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report the case of a 56-year-old man, who, following a temporo-parietal infarct, suffered from debilitating and refractory hemi-body cold dysaesthesia and severe tactile allodynia. This was associated with thermal and tactile hypoaesthesia and hypoalgesia on his affected side. Implantation of a deep brain stimulating electrode in his periventricular gray (PVG) region produced an improvement in his pain that was associated with a striking normalisation of his deficits in somatosensory perception. This improvement in pain and thermal sensibility was reversed as stimulation became less effective, because of increased electrode impedance. Therefore, we postulate that the analgesic benefit may have occurred as a consequence of the normalisation of somatosensory function and we discuss these findings in relation to the theories of central pain generation and the potential to engage useful plasticity in central circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Pain,10.1016/j.pain.2009.09.011,PMC2789248,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This means, that from the psychiatric point of view the hole survey of the exogen reaction type was subdivided. The neurologic symptomatology was rather neglected. In this study an attempt is made to show--using the reports of 77 patients with severe hepatic insufficiency of different etiology--that with very exact and repeated examinations a typical course of neuro-psychiatric symptoms can be observed. A distinct hierarchy of symptoms is existing, which is similar to the well known princip of dissolution (Jackson). As a main factor one has to differentiate between an acute and a subacute course. The acute course is characterized by a rapid decrease of vigilance and increase of neurologic symptoms, which end in most of the cases with an acute midbrain- and bulbarbrain-syndrome, while the subacute course shows primary a disturbance of thymo- and noopsychic function in different relations. In addition to the organic ""Achsensyndrom"" amnestic or amentiell symptoms can be found, which might be covered by a decrease of the vigilance--if the primary noxis continoues--end up with unconsciousness. The parallel developing neurologic symptomatology shows a distraction of the general motoric, including so-called basic movements. later stereotypies and automatismes, and the delicate distal movements change into rough general-rotation-and pointing movements of the hole body. There is also a temporary bending of all extremities and at this time also a rigidospasticity. In the following course preponderate transient bending or stretching, finally there exists a lack condition, which does not respond to external provocations. The symptomatology is not always symmetric. Transient or longstanding hemiparetic symptoms and also crossed brainstem symptoms can be seen frequently. Sometimes there are general or focal epileptic seizures. If a brain edema occurs it leads to a tentorial herniation with the symptoms of an acute midbrain- or bulbarbrain syndrome, which exists in nearly every second patient. If the course turns, the clinical symptomatology is passed in reverse direction. A good relation exists to the known biochemical changes. The disturbed monoaminmetabolism influences the structures, which are important for the vigilance. The serotonin and 5-hydroxyindolaminoacid level in the tegmentum and the hippocampus are increased. Worth to mention, that this is not a specific hepatic disturbance. Additional one can find false transmitters, for example octopamin, which are concerning the excitation, less potent than dopamin or noradrenalin and also a decrease of the latter in the extrapyramidal structures, which corresponds very well with the motoric deficiency and defectsymptoms. Not all of the symptoms can be explained by disturbances of the catecholaminmetabolism.

The patient was also later found to have a positive anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody, which was deemed false positive given the atypical phenotype and symptomatic improvement with thiamine supplementation. This case encourages the consideration of vision loss as a manifestation of WKS, especially in patients who have risk factors. Testing serum levels of thiamine is strongly encouraged; however, initiating empiric treatment is advocated for high clinical suspicion due to its reversible nature and minimal risk for side effects.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.64613,PMC11324805,anti-mog antibody; neuropathy; nutritional deficiency; optic neuropathy; optic perineuritis; retinal ganglion cell neuronopathy; thiamine; vision loss; wernicke-korsakoff syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch, vibration, joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities. He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely, the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission, while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.",{},,Pain,10.1016/j.pain.2004.09.044,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Later, the right leg was amputated, resulting in spontaneous and touch-evoked phantom pain and mechanical stump allodynia. However, quantitative sensory testing revealed considerable impairment of sensations normally mediated by cutaneous nociceptors and central spinothalamic systems on the right body side, including the stump but nearly intact touch and vibration senses. Quantitative assessment of peripheral nociceptive C-fiber function (axon reflex vasodilatation and flare) showed no abnormalities on both sides. Sympathetic blocks did not change spontaneous and evoked pain. Epidural and spinal anesthesia abolished evoked pain but had no effect on spontaneous phantom pain. Extirpation of a neuroma of the sciatic nerve did not alter spontaneous and evoked pain. TENS resulted in an increase in pain. We concluded the following. (i) Painful somatosensory memories that are responsible for phantom limb pain are located in the brain, most probably in the thalamus or cortex. (ii) Touch-evoked phantom pain and stump allodynia are not mediated by cutaneous nociceptive C and A delta fibers and spinal nociceptive pathways (spinothalamic tract). Activity in the lemniscal system (low-threshold mechanoreceptive A beta afferents, dorsal columns and medial lemnicus system) may be transferred to central pain signaling neurons in the thalamus or cortex resulting in touch-evoked pain sensations. (iii) Ongoing activity in cutaneous nociceptive C fibers and spinal nociceptive systems is not necessary to maintain central processes that account for spontaneous and touch-evoked pain sensations. Activity in nociceptors of deep somatic tissues might be more important.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(94)00188-K,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Parietal lesions may generate central pain by mechanisms generally assumed to involve the 'medial' pain system (i.e. medial thalamic nuclei and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)). We report here PET and fMRI data in a patient who developed central pain and allodynia in her left side after a bifocal infarct involving both the right parietal cortex (SI and SII) and the right ACC (Brodmann areas 24 and 32), thus questioning the schematic representation of cortical pain processing. No rCBF increase was found in any part of the residual cingulate cortices, neither in the basal state (which included spontaneous pain and extended hypoperfusion around the infarct), nor during left allodynic pain. Thus, as previously observed in patients with lateral medullary infarct, neither spontaneous pain nor allodynia reproduce the cingulate activation observed after noxious pain in normal subjects. Conversely, both PET and fMRI data argue in favour of plastic changes in the 'lateral discriminative' pain system. Particularly, allodynia was associated with increased activity anteriorly to the infarct in the right insula/SII cortex. This response is likely to be responsible for the strange and very unpleasant allodynic sensation elicited on the left side by a non-noxious stimulation.",{},,Pain,10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00190-6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Case 4 suffered from AIDS dementia complex and developed cervical dystonia while taking risperidone therapy. We also review previously reported cases of dystonia in AIDS patients with the same causes and discuss the issue of increased vulnerability of the basal ganglia to HIV infection which, in turn, leads to increased sensitivity to neuroleptics.

The signs and lesions in cattle are somewhat different from those in swine, which are frequently affected. This report describes several cases of salt poisoning in veal calves. The calves were fed milk replacer and were housed without access to water. Presenting signs were mostly referrable to dysfunction of the central nervous system and included hyperesthesia, opisthotonus, nystagmus, muscle twitching and intermittent convulsions. Although the serum sodium concentration in some of these calves was over 200 mEq/1, no remarkable brain lesions were noted at necropsy. The salt content of the milk replacer was 10 times the level recommended by the National Research Council. This salt may have come from the whey included in the formula.

Left lung contusion; traumatic pneumonia; multiple left rib fractures; left fluid pneumothorax; thyroid tumor of unknown nature, possibly malignant. Grade I tracheal stenosis; Sequelae of cerebral infarction. Because of goiter and severe tracheal compression, the patient was not intubated and received deopiated general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia to preserve spontaneous breathing. At the end of the video-assisted thoracoscopic exploration, the patient was immediately conscious and returned directly to the ward 6 min later.

Ramped bipolar stimulation with a square pulse 2-3 V, 0.2 msec, 50 Hz elicited sensory response such as warm or comfortable sensation. Satisfactory relief of pain was obtained in most cases by 30-minutes-long stimulation twice or three times a day for various period of time ranging from 10 to 14 days. Long-term follow-up ranging from three months to two years showed that three patients had a good result (incomplete pain relief by stimulator with no medication required), two had a fair (incomplete pain relief by stimulator with decreased doses of medication) and another one had a poor result in which the pain had not been relieved with the stimulation in one month. No remarkable side effects were seen.

It can be produced by strategic cerebral infarction, reported in elderly patients with vascular risk factors. Patent foramen ovale has been suggested as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke in young people, especially when associated to aneurysm of the auricular septum and above all to a procoagulating status. An 18-year-old male with a family history of Behçet's disease, who presented right-side thalamic and hippocampal cerebral infarction; following an exhaustive study, patent foramen ovale with septal aneurysm was found as the only risk factor.
