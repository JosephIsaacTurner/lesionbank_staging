38289217,Case 325.,"Suthar, Pokhraj Prakashchandra; Nagarajan, Murali; Bhabad, Sudeep",Suthar,"A 76-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, and hypertension presented with a headache, fever, and dysphagia. The patient was taking prednisone and leflunomide to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Her headache was primarily left sided and occasionally radiated to the occipital region. The patient had a high-grade fever spike, with a temperature of 104°F (40°C). Results of a prior lumbar puncture and temporal artery biopsy from an outside hospital were negative. Findings of a neurologic examination were unremarkable. Oropharyngeal examination for dysphagia revealed minimal pharyngeal motility, with pooling of food in the pharynx, which was thought to be due to cranial nerve dysfunction. Laboratory analysis revealed that, except for anemia, complete blood count parameters were within normal limits. C-reactive protein level (49.7 mg/L; reference range, 0.0-8.0 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>140 mm/h with Westergren method; reference range, 0-27 mm/h), and brain-type natriuretic peptide level (145 pg/mL; reference range, 0-100 pg/mL) were elevated. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, which revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with an elevated CSF protein level (78 mg/dL; reference range, 7.0-35.0 mg/dL) and a low CSF glucose level (37 mg/dL [2.05 mmol/L]; reference range, 45-70 mg/dL [2.50-3.89 mmol/L]); otherwise, CSF encephalopathy, an autoimmune panel, and cultures were negative. MRI and CT scans of the brain with paranasal sinus were performed (Figs 1-3). Nasal endoscopy-guided drainage of the preclival fluid collection was performed, and biopsy of nasopharyngeal tissue was performed. Fluid culture revealed the growth of <i>Candida albicans</i>, as well as <i>Pseudomonas</i> and <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>. The patient received fluconazole, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Follow-up MRI was performed after 2 weeks (Fig 4).",{},,Radiology,10.1148/radiol.223334,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed acute infarct and small left basal ganglia old lacunar infarction. He was discharged on a dual antiplatelet. One week later, the patient's condition had worsened and, therefore, was admitted with an impression of ischemic stroke. A bedside swallowing assessment, VFSS, and FEES study were conducted to diagnose this case. The bedside assessment did not reveal any sensory or motor deficits in his oral cavity and the FEES examination was also unable to rule out pharyngeal dysphagia. However, a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) revealed a significant dysfunction of oral preparation and oral phases and presented difficulty initiating the pharyngeal phase. Given these features, we believe that this swallowing difficulty is caused by swallowing apraxia. This case provides additional information and understanding on management from the swallowing side.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,10.3390/ijerph192316329,PMC9737384,FEES; VFSS; ischemic stroke; swallowing apraxia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
36923779,Lateral medullary syndrome: uncommon form of brainstem stroke.,"Ahmed Ibrahim, Abdiwahid; Bakir, Ahmet; Osman Sidow, Nor; Mohamed Ali, Abdiladhif; Farah Osman, Mohamed; Ahmed, Abdulkadir; Sheikh Hassan, Mohamed",Ahmed Ibrahim,"Lateral medullary syndrome (LMS) is a less common form of a brainstem stroke. It is the result of occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). It is caused by atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or emboli from another source. A 60-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with vertigo, vomiting, slurred speech, hiccups, and left-side weakness associated with paresthesia for 1 day. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and a smoking habit. The neurological examination revealed ataxia, and left hemiparesis associated with paresthesia. A cranial nerve examination revealed slight right-sided ptosis, mouth deviation, and loss of sensory sensation on the right side of the face. Brain MRI showed right medullary infarct consistent with LMS. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and vertebral artery color Doppler were normal. He was admitted to the neurology ward and was treated with low molecular weight heparin 60 mg subcutaneously, aspirin 300 mg, neuroprotective agents, and antihypertensive treatment. After 6 days of medical treatment, his condition has improved massively (dysarthria and dysphagia disappeared). He was discharged for physical rehabilitation. LMS (Wallenberg syndrome) is one of the brainstem stroke syndromes caused by occlusion of PICA. Vertigo, vomiting, dysphagia, dysarthria, ipsilateral ataxia, Horner's syndrome, and contralateral hemiparesis define this syndrome. Brain MRI is necessary for diagnosis alongside clinical syndrome. LMS is a rare form of brainstem stroke and carries a favorable prognosis if early hospitalization and treatment is applied. Brain MRI, including diffusion sequence, is the most useful diagnostic tool for detecting LMS.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1097/MS9.0000000000000260,PMC10010825,PICA; brainstem stroke; lateral medullary syndrome,Case Reports,England,eng

24818556,Stroke: subacute/inpatient management of acute ischemic stroke.,"Silver, Brian; Wulf Silver, Rachel",Silver,"A stroke unit is a designated hospital area in which patients with stroke are evaluated and treated. Such units have been proven to reduce mortality and disability more than hospitalization in a general medical ward. Diagnostic testing for a patient with stroke includes complete blood count, urine toxicology screening, brain imaging, imaging of neck and cerebral arteries, and cardiac evaluation (including prolonged outpatient rhythm monitoring). Inpatient management should include dysphagia screening and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. Lower extremity compression stockings do not prevent venous thromboembolism in stroke patients, but intermittent pneumatic compression devices are of proven value. Patients who do not receive thrombolytic therapy should receive aspirin. A statin should be started if the patient's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 100 mg/dL or higher. Delirium occurs commonly in patients with stroke and more commonly with increased age and stroke severity. Interventions, such as routine oxygen supplementation, prophylactic antibiotics, empiric antipyretic management, and early mobilization, are under investigation.

37539958,Wernicke's Encephalopathy in Type 2 Achalasia: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Rodriguez, Diana N; Gera, Kriti; Paudel, Bishal; Pham, Angela",Rodriguez,"Achalasia is primarily a smooth muscle motility disorder of the esophagus driven by aberrant peristalsis and failure of sphincter relaxation. Notably, achalasia is a heterogeneous disease with primarily 3 possible pattern subtypes. According to the review of current cases and literature regarding achalasia, patients primarily present with dysphagia, usually to solids and, if progressed, to solids and liquids. Rarely, untreated achalasia may result in thiamine deficiency and present as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This acute neurologic condition primarily affects the central and peripheral nervous system and is known by the triad of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion. Individuals who present with WKS typically have a notable history of chronic alcohol abuse with decreased thiamine intake and metabolism. Although less common, individuals with WKS may have a pertinent history of starvation, anorexia nervosa, and malnutrition. This case highlights a unique presentation of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) in a 30-year-old woman with severe type II achalasia complicated by a 60-pound weight loss in a span of 2 months. According to our literature review, there have only been 2 previously reported cases of severe achalasia leading to the development of WE.

The elongated styloid process can cause symptoms like dysphagia, facial or neck pain, syncope, visual changes, etc. In severe cases, it may cause a rupture or dissection of the carotid artery, which can lead to intracranial thrombo-embolism and ischemic stroke. We report a case of a 57-year-old male presenting with dysarthria and mild left-sided body weakness. An initial non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan showed a possible right internal carotid artery thrombus. He developed worsening left-sided weakness and gaze palsy one day after the admission. Repeated CT brain and intracranial angiography were arranged, which showed significant oedema with mass effect and right internal carotid artery dissection with thrombus. He underwent decompressive craniectomy. An enlarged styloid process measuring 4.53 cm in close proximity to the cervical vasculature was also noted. He was not deemed an appropriate candidate for styloidectomy. Due to residual left-sided weakness, he had to take early retirement. He underwent extensive rehabilitation and was able to mobilize with the help of a quad stick after a period of nine months.

The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with VS treated with SRS who underwent CI between 1990 and 2019 at a single tertiary care referral center. Patient demographics, tumor features, treatment parameters, and pre- and postimplantation audiometric and clinical outcomes are presented. Seventeen patients (18 ears) underwent SRS and ipsilateral CI during the study period. Thirteen patients (76%) had neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Median age at SRS and CI were 44 and 48 years, respectively. Median time from SRS to CI was 60 days, but notably, 4 patients underwent SRS and CI within 1 day and 5 patients underwent CI more than 7 years after SRS. Median marginal dose was 13 Gy. Median treatment volume at the time of SRS was 1400 mm3 (range 84-6080 mm3, n = 15 patients). Median post-CI PTA was 28 dB HL, improved from 101 dB HL preoperatively (p < 0.001). Overall, 11 patients (12 ears) exhibited open-set speech understanding. Sentence testing was performed at a median of 10 months (range 1-143 months) post-CI. The median AzBio sentence score for patients with open-set speech understanding was 76% (range 19%-95%, n = 10 ears). Two ears exhibited Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) sentence scores of 49% and 95%, respectively. Four patients achieved environmental sound awareness without open-set speech recognition. Two had no detectable auditory percepts. Most patients who underwent CI following SRS for VS enjoyed access to sound at near-normal levels, with the majority achieving good open-set speech understanding. Implantation can be performed immediately following SRS or in a delayed fashion, depending on hearing status as well as other factors. This strategy may be applied to cases of sporadic or NF2-associated VS.

The patient presented with a mixed cerebellar and parkinsonian syndrome, incomplete levodopa response, and autonomic failure. The clinical diagnosis was multiple system atrophy (MSA). Supportive features of MSA according to the consensus diagnostic criteria included postural instability and early falls, early dysphagia, pyramidal signs, and orofacial dystonia. Multiple exclusion criteria for a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) were present. Neuropathological examination of the left hemisphere and the whole midbrain and brainstem revealed LBD, neocortical-type consistent with iPD, hippocampal sclerosis, and widespread neoplastic infiltration by an anaplastic astrocytoma without evidence of a space occupying lesion. There were no pathological features of MSA. The classification of atypical parkinsonism was difficult in this patient. The clinical features and disease course were confounded by the coexistent tumor, leading to atypical presentation and a diagnosis of MSA. We suggest that the initial features were due to Lewy body pathology, while progression and ataxia, pyramidal signs, and falls were accelerated by the occurrence of the astrocytoma. Our case reflects the challenges of an accurate diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism, the potential for confounding co-pathology and the need for autopsy examination to reach a definitive diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12848,PMC10084019,Lewy body disease; anaplastic astrocytoma; atypical parkinsonism; multiple system atrophy; neuropathology,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Therefore, corrective surgeries including cricopharyngeal myotomy, laryngeal suspension, and pharyngeal flap were performed. Thirty-six days after surgery, FILS rapidly and dramatically improved to level 8. This is the first report describing a successful surgical intervention for EV-D68-induced refractory dysphagia.

The dorsolateral medullary syndrome combined with the eight-and-a-half syndromes is even rarer, so it is important to recognize the features of the classical brainstem syndrome and the eight-and-a-half syndromes. Most patients with dorsolateral medullary syndrome combined with eight-and-a-half syndromes have a good prognosis, with recovery occurring within a few weeks to a few months, although a few patients may take longer to recover. In the course of disease development, the patient developed dysarthria, dysphagia, hypothermia, ipsilateral Horner sign and ataxia. Computed tomography was performed which showed cerebral infarction in the left brainstem. Cranial diffusion-weighted imaging + magnetic resonance angiography showed acute infarction in the left cerebellar hemisphere, with a high probability of severe stenosis or occlusion in the intracranial and proximal segments of the basilar arteries. This supports the diagnosis of dorsolateral medullary syndrome. The patient's limited adduction and abduction of the left eye and limited adduction of the right eye, combined with peripheral paralysis of the affected lateral nerve, supported the diagnosis of eight-and-a-half syndromes. The administration of antiplatelet and anti-ester fixation treatment can effectively improve the symptoms and shorten the course of the disease. After antiplatelet and anti-ester fixation treatment, the symptoms improved and the patient was discharged.

We also highlight the importance of attributing localization value to sequential homologous lesions of the brain that can unveil symptoms due to a ""loss of compensation phenomenon"" that we propose be termed as ""FCM phenomenon.""

Posterior circulation strokes can be diagnostically challenging because the presenting symptoms are often subtle or non-focal and can be missed by commonly used stroke scales. This case report describes a patient who presented to the ED with symptoms of progressive dizziness over a 12-h period, which was followed by the rapid onset of an inability to swallow and, at the time of his presentation, no other neurologic deficits. CASE REPORT The patient was a 55-year-old man with a history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tobacco and electronic cigarette use, and aortic atherosclerosis who presented to the ED for evaluation of his inability to swallow. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was zero. Non-contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple foci of acute infarction in the left dorsolateral medulla and left cerebellar hemisphere in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution. In the hospital, the patient developed an inability to stand, without loss of balance. Persistent dysphagia and inability to swallow necessitated the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS This case describes a relatively rare type of posterior circulation stroke. In addition to traditional risk factors, this patient had risk factors, such as electronic cigarette use, for which there is limited emerging evidence of association with stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.930502,PMC8141337,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In select instances, vascular pathology can be attributed to this complicated interplay of motion and structure found within this narrow space. The authors report 3 cases of complex vascular pathology related to motion at the CCJ and detail the management of these cases. Two cases involved posterior circulation vascular compression syndromes, and one case involved a vascular anomaly and its relation to aneurysm formation and rupture. The patient in Case 1 was a 66-year-old man with a history of syncopal episodes resulting from the bilateral vertebral artery becoming occluded when he rotated his head. Successful microsurgical decompression at the skull base resulted in patent bilateral vertebral artery V3 segments upon head movement in all directions. The patient in Case 2 was a 53-year-old woman who underwent elective resection of a right temporal meningioma and who experienced postoperative drowsiness, dysphagia, and mild right-arm ataxia. Subsequent MRI demonstrated bilateral posterior inferior cerebel-lar artery (PICA) strokes. Cerebral angiography showed a single PICA, of extradural origin, supplying both cerebellar hemispheres. The PICA exhibited dynamic extradural compression when the patient rotated her head; the bilateral PICA strokes were due to head rotation during surgical positioning. In Case 3, a 37-year-old woman found unconscious in her home had diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and evidence of a right PICA aneurysm. A right far-lateral craniectomy was performed for aneurysm clipping, and she was found to have a dissecting aneurysm with an associated PICA originating extradurally. There was a shearing phenomenon of the extradural PICA along the dura of the foramen magnum, and this microtraumatic stress imposed on the vessel resulted in a dissecting aneurysm.

A combination of flupentixol and melitracen is used as an antianxiety-antidepressant drug which may induce hyponatremia. Herein, we report a 46-year-old woman with depression who was treated with flupentixol and melitracen 0.5/10 mg once daily for 6 months. Later, the dosage increased to 0.5/10 mg twice daily. At the same time, she had complains of intermittent dizziness and fatigue. The laboratory test revealed hyponatremia (121 mmol/L). Dizziness was improved after sodium supplementation, with an increase in blood sodium to 133 mmol/L. Twenty days later, she had difficulty opening the mouth and swallowing, needing a gastric tube due to severe dysphagia. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a symmetric abnormal signal of caudate nucleus and lenticular nuclei. The symptoms were not relieved after active treatment, such as rehydration. However, her symptoms improved significantly after discontinuation of flupentixol and melitracen and switching to promethazine. Follow-up head MRI after 4 months revealed no abnormal signals. The patient who developed EPM had dysphagia, despite appropriate correction of hyponatremia. Flupentixol and melitracen can cause hyponatremia and dysphagia.

We report an autopsy case of an elderly man with brainstem ADEM that progressed over a period of about 3 months. An 82-year-old man developed disturbance of consciousness, dysphagia, and ataxic gait over a period of about 3 months. He was admitted to another hospital for aspiration pneumonia and recovered but was transferred to our hospital due to prolonged disturbance of consciousness. The patient was able to follow simple commands but had a tendency to somnolence. In addition to meningeal stimulation signs, the patient had left-dominant upper and lower limb ataxia and right-dominant limb spasticity. Brain FLAIR/T2-weighted imaging showed high-intensity lesions from the brainstem to the middle cerebellar peduncle bilaterally, medulla oblongata and upper cervical spinal cord, and T1-weighted imaging revealed contrast-enhanced lesions in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and cervical spinal cord. Although spinal fluid examination revealed elevated proteins, other laboratory tests indicated no evidence of infection, vasculitis, collagen diseases or tumors, and anti-ganglioside, anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies were negative. After admission, the patient again developed aspiration pneumonia, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and he died on the 15th day of hospitalization. Autopsy findings indicated acute and subacute demyelination mainly in the brainstem and cerebellum, and perivascular lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration in the areas of demyelination. A postmortem diagnosis of ADEM was made based on the generally monophasic course of the disease and the absence of regenerating myelinated sheaths. There are very few reports of elderly patients with brainstem ADEM.

35675222,Contralateral Tongue Deviation Due to Paramedian Pontine Infarction: A Brief Review of Cortico-Hypoglossal Projections.,"Zhou, Chenxuan; Cheng, Mengyao",Zhou,"BACKGROUND Motor function of the tongue is controlled by the hypoglossal nucleus (the lower motor neuron) and its supranuclear innervation (the upper motor neuron). Tongue deviation due to muscle weakness on one side is common in brain stem stroke and is usually associated with dysarthria and dysphagia that decrease the patient's quality of life. This case report presents a typical but rarely discussed case of tongue deviation secondary to a brain stem stroke. In addition, it also offers a concise review of both the ipsilateral and the contralateral cortico-hypoglossal fibers that innervate the hypoglossal nucleus. Even though the direction of the tongue deviation offers essential clues to localizing the brain lesion, many providers lack experience and knowledge in this area. CASE REPORT We report the case of an 81-year-old right-handed male patient with right-sided hemiparesis, right lower facial droop, dysarthria, and tongue deviated to the right side without fasciculation or atrophy. The Babinski sign was positive on the right. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infarct in the left paramedian pontine. Since both the tongue deviation and the hemiparesis were right-sided, contralateral to the side of the lesion, we concluded that the lesion affected the cortico-hypoglossal fibers and the corticospinal fibers prior to their decussations. CONCLUSIONS The case report reviews the projections of the corticospinal fibers. Each hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both hemispheres, with the contralateral descending fibers passing through the medial part of the ventral pons and the ipsilateral descending fibers passing through the more lateral aspect of the pons. The decussation is generally located at the pontomedullary junction, with exceptions due to individual variance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936511,PMC9190772,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

When they arise from the falx, tentorium, or tentorial incisura, they are not always considered a true PR tumor, as they do not originate from it but instead only grow toward the region. The true meningioma of PR must be originated from the arachnoid envelope of the pineal gland or from the 2 leaflets of the velum interpositum. In both conditions there are no dural attachments.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> Occipital interhemispheric transtentorial and supracerebellar infratentorial are the 2 main approaches for tumors within this region. Aside from the surgeon's preference, the position of the venous system and the direction of the tumor growth guide the approach choice. Endoscope assistance can help reach areas unable to be visualized under the microscope.<sup>3-5</sup> We report the case of a 37-year-old female with a large PR meningioma (velum interpositum) presenting with intense dysphagia, dysphonia, and bilateral tongue palsy.

33762391,Lessons of the month: A challenging presentation of hypopituitarism secondary to an intracerebral aneurysm.,"Mullarkey, Emma M; Iyer, Ashok; Ihuoma, Ajibola",Mullarkey,"A 65-year-old man presented to ambulatory care with a 10-month history of muscle weakness, weight loss, dysphagia and fatigue.Prior to presentation he had been managed in general practice for hypothyroidism with a low T4 level and normal thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH). He was commenced on levothyroxine yet, despite dose titrations, had ongoing symptoms. He had been extensively reviewed by gastroenterology and rheumatology teams.The thyroid function tests (TFTs) pattern prompted a pituitary hormone profile test, which revealed panhypopituitarism with a cortisol of 22 nmol/L. Therefore, hydrocortisone was commenced. A pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a left internal carotid aneurysm that was confirmed on computed tomography angiography. He successfully underwent embolisation of the aneurysm in the local neurosurgical centre.This case highlights the importance of correctly interpreting TFTs as this patient's initial TFTs indicated central hypothyroidism which should have prompted urgent pituitary hormone screening. The risk of addisonian crisis with commencement of levothyroxine without steroid replacement in secondary hypothyroidism emphasises the importance of TFT interpretation. Internal carotid artery aneurysms are a rare, yet important, cause of hypopituitarism resulting in high mortality and morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis secondary to the pressure effects of the aneurysm or the effects of aneurysmal rupture.",{},,"Clinical medicine (London, England)",10.7861/clinmed.2020-1017,PMC8002787,hypopituitarism; intracranial aneurysm; secondary hypothyroidism,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

32055443,Central nervous system tuberculoma with miliary tuberculosis in the elderly.,"Tetsuka, Syuichi; Suzuki, Tomohiro; Ogawa, Tomoko; Hashimoto, Ritsuo; Kato, Hiroyuki",Tetsuka,"The aging phenomenon of tuberculosis (TB) patients is recognized all over the world, but no country is as prominent as Japan. Central nervous system (CNS) TB includes clinical entities: tuberculous meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma, and clinical features of CNS TB in the elderly may be atypical, non-specific, and confused with concomitant age-related diseases. Atypical clinical manifestations of TB in older persons can result in delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. A 91-year-old woman was brought to our emergency department after her family noted her altered mental status. Chest computed tomography confirmed miliary opacities. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein level, low glucose level, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple well‑defined enhancing lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and the pons, suggestive of tuberculomas. Smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests confirmed <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> in the sputum and aspirate. Based on the CSF and brain MRI findings and the sputum microbiology results indicating the presence of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> in the sputum and gastric aspirate, the patient was diagnosed with CNS tuberculoma. The onset of TB is mainly associated with decreased immunity; however, several other factors such as comorbidities, decreased activity, dysphagia, and malnutrition, which influence one another, also influence the development of TB in the elderly. Because the mortality rate of TB increases rapidly with age, reaching approximately 30 % among the elderly, early diagnosis is critical.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,IDCases,10.1016/j.idcr.2020.e00710,PMC7005458,Central nervous system; Elderly; Miliary tuberculosis; Tuberculoma,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

26482228,Multifocal leukoencephalopathy in cocaine users: a report of two cases and review of the literature.,"Vosoughi, Reza; Schmidt, Brian J",Vosoughi,"Cocaine abuse is associated with several mechanisms of brain injury including ischemic, hemorrhagic and metabolic. Recently two case reports of leukoencephalopathy in cocaine users implicated a commonly used cocaine adulterant, levamisole. One well-documented adverse effect of levamisole, when used alone as antihelminthic or immunomodulatory drug, is multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy. Therefore, immune mechanisms may also contribute to cocaine-induced brain injury. Two cocaine users with multifocal leukoencephalopathy, treated with steroids and plasmapheresis, are described. The first is a 25-year-old man who presented with unilateral motor and sensory impairment progressing to bilateral deficits, dysphagia, dysarthria and confusion over several days. Serial MRI showed increasing abnormal FLAIR signal lesions with patchy restricted diffusion and heterogenous enhancement deep in the right and left hemispheres, including periventricular white matter as well as in the pons and cerebellar peduncle. The second patient is a 41-year-old woman who presented with confusion and impaired balance. MRI showed bilateral periventricular FLAIR lesions with scattered restricted diffusion and subtle gadolinium enhancement of some of the lesions. She initially stabilized with supportive care only, but after further cocaine use was re-admitted six weeks later with marked neurological deterioration and MRI showed prominent worsening of the lesions. Both patients received steroid and plasma exchange and showed substantial improvement clinically and on imaging, which was sustained during out-patient follow-up. Multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with cocaine use may have an inflammatory/immune basis, possibly related to levamisole contamination, at least in some patients. Three cases, including the present two, have been described wherein good neurological improvement was seen in association with steroid treatment. However, in the absence of appropriate clinical trials, it remains unknown whether immunotherapy is truly beneficial for these patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-015-0467-1,PMC4615875,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng
22940824,Rhabdomyolysis after neurosurgery: a review and a framework for prevention.,"De Tommasi, Claudio; Cusimano, Michael D",De Tommasi,"Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is a potentially fatal or disabling clinical syndrome resulting in muscle necrosis and leakage of muscle constituents into the blood. Lactic acidosis and more serious complications such as acute renal failure may occur in up to half of recognized cases, so accurate diagnosis is required. We present three cases in which RM occurred in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures performed in the lateral position. A review of the literature is provided together with a framework for the prevention of this surgical complication. Three patients underwent neurosurgical procedures in the lateral position for left facial/glossopharyngeal neuralgia, for jugular foramen tumor, and for a petroclival meningioma, respectively. All patients were obese and all three showed massive postoperative elevation in creatine kinase (CK) levels characteristic of RM. Myoglobinuria was identified in two patients and all three showed hyperintensity of the hip gird muscles in the short tau inversion recovery sequence magnetic resonance imaging. All recovered spontaneously and none went on to develop renal failure. A literature review showed that RM has been rarely reported after neurosurgery. However, the duration of procedures of the cases of reported RM indicates that the prevalence of the condition is likely highly under-recognized in neurosurgery. This is particularly important given the rising obesity rates seen in many countries. Obese patients undergoing long neurosurgical procedures, particularly in the lateral position, should be suspected of RM and should be closely monitored for CK levels, myoglobinuria, and acidosis. We outline a framework of strategies for the prevention of the condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-012-0423-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

He exhibited spontaneous right-beating horizontal-torsional nystagmus that intensified on rightward gaze. The patient fell to the left side during the Romberg test. Cranial computed tomography (CT) performed immediately upon admission did not provide evidence for ischemia or hemorrhage of the brainstem and cerebellum; however, the symptoms underwent exacerbation 4 h after admission, manifesting as left-sided limb weakness and dysarthria, without dysphagia. Furthermore, bedside examination revealed difficulty in extending the tongue to the right, positive left Babinski's sign, and abnormal vibration and position sense in the paralyzed limb. Head impulse test recording revealed a normal gain in the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and numerous consistent covert corrective saccades were captured upon turning the head to the left side.

In order to measure swallowing capacity and risk of aspiration a routine clinical assessment used in the speech therapy clinic was performed and two valid clinical tests were used: Massey Bedside Swallowing Screen (MBSS) and Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS). After evaluation with the clinical tests, it was observed that the patient had reduced swallowing capacity, performance characterized as pathological, 100% dysfunction in the water swallowing test (MBSS), presence of choking, coughing, change in vocal quality and anterior escape. In the assessment of risk of aspiration with the GUSS, the patient presented moderate dysphagia and risk of laryngotracheal aspiration.This case report demonstrated that moderate dysphagia is found in a stroke patient with lesions that affect the cerebellum.

32682639,The Trouble with Swallowing: Dysphagia as the Presenting Symptom in Lateral Medullary Syndrome.,"Frederick, Meaghan; Rajpal, Abhinav; Kircher, Charles; Faryar, Kiran A",Frederick,"Posterior circulation strokes account for approximately one-fourth of all ischemic strokes, but are frequently misdiagnosed by emergency providers. Current standard stroke screening tools such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale are weighted toward anterior circulation stroke diagnosis. Lateral medullary syndrome, a type of posterior circulation stroke, can be particularly challenging to diagnose due to nonspecific presenting symptoms, such as dysphagia. This report describes a 65-year-old man who presented with dysphagia, dizziness, and hoarseness. An initial neurological examination did not reveal any gross deficits, and imaging to evaluate for posterior circulation stroke was not obtained. The patient presented the following day with worsening symptoms, prompting imaging that revealed a large cerebellar ischemic infarction. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Although dysphagia frequently occurs in lateral medullary syndrome, it is rarely the presenting symptom in the emergency department. In patients with cerebrovascular risk factors who present with dysphagia, a complete neurological examination should be performed and noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head should be obtained if a neurological deficit is appreciated. Due to their poor sensitivity, CT scans can frequently miss posterior circulation strokes, therefore magnetic resonance imaging should be considered if provider suspicion remains high. Emergency providers are encouraged to have a high level of suspicion for this rare but debilitating stroke syndrome to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed care.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.06.008,,Wallenberg syndrome; dizziness; dysphagia; lateral medullary syndrome; posterior circulation stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 49-year-old woman was hospitalized with progressively worsening left-sided weakness, dysphagia, diplopia, and vertigo. Shortly before hospital admission, the patient had been treated at another facility with corticosteroids and plasma exchanges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies conducted at the time of admission showed demyelinating lesions of the pons consistent with ADEM; rapid progression of the patient's symptoms also suggested an autoimmune, demyelinating process, and viral studies ruled out an infectious etiology. Despite initial treatment with i.v. immune globulin and additional corticosteroid courses, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate over the next few weeks, with development of respiratory distress requiring intubation. Repeat MRI revealed a new brain lesion in the splenial region of the corpus callosum, prompting the initiation of i.v. cyclophosphamide therapy (180 mg daily). Approximately 19 days after cyclophosphamide therapy was initiated, an MRI scan revealed substantial reduction of the pontine hemorrhage and a normal splenium appearance, with no new lesion development. The use of cyclophosphamide for hemorrhagic ADEM refractory to other treatments has been previously reported. After approximately three weeks of daily i.v. cyclophosphamide therapy, a patient with hemorrhagic ADEM was noted to have stable to improved brain MRI findings along with limited improvement of mental status and movement symptoms.",{},,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,10.2146/ajhp150079,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A retrospective descriptive case series of 22 (N = 22) adult patients over a 6-year period with acquired VPI and varying degrees of dysphagia and dysphonia was described from a multi-disciplinary voice and swallowing clinic. Perceptual assessment, nasopharyngoscopy, fluoroscopic swallowing assessment, and patient reported outcomes were reviewed to characterize the cohort. VPI etiologies included: stroke (n = 4), head and neck cancer (n = 5), brainstem lesions (n = 5), trauma (n = 5), and other/unknown (n = 3). All 22 patients underwent nasopharyngoscopy and were categorized as having unilateral (n = 13), central (n = 4), or no (n = 5) velopharyngeal deficits.

Its clinical profile and prognosis are not well known. We report four cases of medullary hemorrhage and a review of the English and French literature since 1964 to analyze the clinical presentation and prognosis. Of sixteen case reports of medullary hemorrhage reviewed from the literature, sixteen contained sufficient information for review and are included in this report. The age distribution of the patients was between 13 and 72 years, and 10 of these patients were men. The most frequent symptoms at onset were vertigo, sensory symptoms, and dysphagia. Presenting signs included palatal weakness, nystagmus, hypoglossal palsy, cerebellar ataxia, and limb weakness. The diagnosis was made at autopsy in 3 patients, at surgery in 3, by computed tomography in 4, and more recently by magnetic resonance imaging in 6. In nine instances the etiology of hemorrhage was undetermined; a ruptured vascular malformation was the cause in 3 patients, 1 was attributed to the use of anticoagulants, and hypertension was the suspected cause in the other 3 patients. Mortality rate was 19%; however, survivors generally had nonincapacitating sequelaes. These findings indicate that primary medullary hemorrhage presents with a characteristic syndrome of sudden onset of headache and vertigo with neurological signs that correspond to various combinations of medial and lateral medullary involvement. In those patients who survive, prognosis usually is good.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.25.8.1684,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 80 minutes after onset revealed no acute ischemic stroke lesions, but magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated complete occlusion of the right vertebral artery. Based on these neurological and MRA findings, atypical lateral medullary infarction was suggested, and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) was started 178 minutes after onset. Right hemiplegia improved immediately after IV-tPA administration. MRI performed on hospital day 2 showed an acute ischemic lesion on the right side of the medulla oblongata, resulting in a diagnosis of Opalski syndrome. Opalski syndrome is a rare subtype of Wallenberg syndrome accompanied by hemiplegia of the side ipsilateral to the lesion, and expansion of the stroke lesion to the corticospinal tract below the pyramidal decussation is considered to cause ipsilateral hemiplegia. Based on this case and previous reports, Opalski syndrome should be considered when limb ataxia and crossed sensory deficit are observed among patients with hyperacute-onset hemiplegia, and IV t-PA therapy should be considered even in the absence of neurological findings such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and Horner's signs and radiological evidence of acute ischemic stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104806,,Opalski syndrome; Wallenberg syndrome; cerebral infarction; recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator; vertebral artery; vertebral artery dissection,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Two months before the first visit, he developed posterior neck pain followed by difficulty swallowing 1 month later. He was referred to our clinic because of gradually worsening dysphagia. Physical examination showed paralysis of cranial nerves IX, X, and XII; therefore, he was hospitalized. Because enhanced CT and MRI showed a partially thrombosed right vertebral artery aneurysm, he was transferred to the care of the Department of Neurosurgery. Parent artery occlusion of the right vertebral artery aneurysm was performed and it improved his symptoms. After regaining his ability to take in liquid food, he was transferred to another hospital for further rehabilitation. In this case, we attributed the dysphagia to aneurysmal compression of the roots of cranial nerves IX, X, and XII. A partially thrombosed cerebral artery aneurysm may often rupture and cause worsening of neurologic symptoms. The prognosis is generally poor because the rupture rate is extremely high especially with large or giant aneurysms.

We aim to report new manifestations of Avellis syndrome in this report. A 47-year-old Chinese peasant woman who felt sudden dizziness, nausea when she was doing the laundry was referred to our department from other hospital. She vomited the stomach contents once and complained numbness of the left trunk and limbs as well as coughing while drinking. The patient presented with palatopharyngeal paralysis, Horner syndrome, and diminished pain as well as temperature sensation in the contralateral face, trunk, and limbs. She also presented with ipsilateral prosopalgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and central poststroke pain. T2-weighted MRI images demonstrated a high-signal intensity lesion in the right medulla oblongata which indicated a banded infarction site. The patient was diagnosed with medulla oblongata infarction, Avellis syndrome, Horner syndrome, dysphagia, hemiparesthesia, ipsilateral prosopalgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and central poststroke pain.

A few cases of SSS secondary to structural lesions in the medulla have been reported, but there has never been a reported case of the rare sign akin to TBS following acute non-medullary brainstem infarction. Furthermore, new-onset cardiac arrhythmias in stroke often presented in one continuous pattern - either as bradycardia or tachycardia, but instances of an alternating fashion have been rarely reported. We present the case of a 46-year-old female who developed severe dizziness with vomiting, diplopia, and slurred speech, which gradually worsened to quadriplegia, severe hypophonia, and dysphagia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated acute midbrain and pontine infarction. Except for neurological symptoms, the patient experienced unexpected TBS with the symptoms of excessive sweating, palpitations, and irritability without any other predisposing factors. The frequency of the episodes gradually declined until it spontaneously disappeared the 5<sup>th</sup> day after admission. Given the unpredictable nature of the tachycardia and bradycardia, it was challenging to manage the arrythmias with medications. A pacemaker was recommended, but financial reasons led the patient to reject this option. Two weeks after antithrombotic therapy and rehabilitation, she was discharged with residual symptoms of diplopia, moderate dysarthria, mild quadriplegia, and no cardiac symptoms. Our case highlighted the occurrence of TBS as a new-onset arrhythmia that can manifest during the acute phase of non-medullary brainstem infarcts.

9190100,The role of the insular cortex in dysphagia.,"Daniels, S K; Foundas, A L",Daniels,"Recent data indicate that dysphagia may occur following unilateral cortical stroke; however, the elucidation of specific cytoarchitectonic sites that produce deglutition disorders remains unclear. In a previous study of unilateral cortical stroke patients with dysphagia, Daniels et al. proposed that the insula may be important in swallowing as it was the most common lesion site in the patients studied. Therefore, 4 unilateral stroke patients with discrete lesions of the insular cortex were studied to further facilitate understanding of the role of the insula in swallowing. Dysphagia, as confirmed by videofluoroscopy, was evident in 3 of the 4 patients; all had lesions that involved the anterior insula, whereas the only patient without dysphagia had a lesion restricted to the posterior insula. These data suggest that the anterior insula may be an important cortical substrate in swallowing. The anterior insula has connections to the primary and supplementary motor cortices, the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus, and to the nucleus tractus solitarius, all of which are important regions in the mediation of oropharyngeal swallowing. Therefore, discrete lesions of the anterior insula may disrupt these connections and, thereby, produce dysphagia.",{},,Dysphagia,10.1007/PL00009529,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Computed tomography showed a dense basilar artery sign without evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. After treated with aspirin and dipyridamole, he had massive symptomatic brainstem hemorrhagic transformation on the next day. After medical treatment, he survived but remained in locked-in state with occasional drowsiness. Hemorrhagic transformation following brainstem infarction is a rare yet potentially devastating condition in patients without thrombolytic therapy.

Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies over that period revealed three high-intensity signal lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, appearing in chronological order in the left upper and left lower medulla oblongata and left pontine base. Despite some clinical improvement following methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the patient died of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed four fresh, well-defined lesions in the brainstem, three of which corresponded to the lesions detected radiologically. The remaining lesion was located in the dorsal medulla oblongata and involved the right solitary nucleus. This might have appeared at a later disease stage, eventually causing respiratory failure. Histologically, all four lesions showed loss of myelin, preservation of axons, and infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly CD8-positive T cells, consistent with the histological features of autoimmune demyelinating diseases, particularly the confluent demyelination observed in the early and acute phases of multiple sclerosis (MS). In the cerebral white matter, autoimmune demyelination appeared superimposed on ischemic changes, consistent with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI findings on initial admission. No anti-AQP4 or MOG antibodies or those potentially causing autoimmune encephalitis/demyelination were detected in either the serum or CSF. Despite several similarities to MS, such as the relapsing-remitting disease course and lesion histology, the entire clinicopathological picture in the present patient, especially the advanced age at onset and development of brainstem lesions in close proximity within a short time frame, did not fit those of MS or other autoimmune diseases that are currently established.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed venous infarction and hemorrhagic changes with brain swelling in the right parietal lobe. Angiography revealed a right TS-DAVF and multiple occlusions with retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage into the cortical veins. The TS-DAVF was graded as Borden type III and Cognard type IIa+b. Because of its progressive clinical nature and wide distribution of DAVF in the occluded sinus wall, he underwent emergent TAE with liquid embolic materials including n-butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx under informed consent by his family. Complete obliteration of the TS-DAVF was achieved, leading to a marked amelioration of symptoms, and MRI after treatment confirmed a decrease in the brain swelling. However, he suffered transient dysphagia due to right vagal nerve palsy caused by occlusion of vasa nervorum of ascending pharyngeal artery. He returned home 5 months later with a modified Rankin Scale of 1. TAE with Onyx appears to be effective for aggressive TS-DAVF with a widely distributed shunt.

Speech therapy is more often an essential part of the rehabilitation program. Studies in aphasia have primarily focused on two major pathways: the arcuate fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a major fiber bundle connecting Broca's area (associated with language production) and Wernicke's area (associated with language comprehension). Damage to this pathway can result in different types of aphasia, depending on the location and extent of the injury. Tractography is a neuroimaging technique used to map the white matter tracts in the brain. Our patient had an occlusion of the external carotid and left carotid siphon. The patient exhibited early complex language deficits involving both motor expressive and comprehensive abilities. After three months the patient presented conduction aphasia caused by damage to the inferior parietal lobule, which extends into the subcortical white matter and damages the arcuate fascicle. This patient was re-assessed for spasticity and language treatments needs, few months after the stroke. Considering first two months language improvement followed by any further language expressive improvement from 3rd to 6th month, a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was requested to study interconnections between cortical and subcortical matter. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in our hospital showed an extensive malacic gliotic area in the left temporal-frontal parietal site. Brain MRI is confirmed as a multimodal tool evaluating the damage, both from the point of structural and functional view. Tractography in aphasia allows focusing on major pathways. The involvement of the arcuate fascicle, whose lesion disconnects Broca's and Wernicke's areas, is related to clinical improvement, and represents a neural correlate of the brain injury recovery process that physicians and speech therapists might be aware of it, tailoring the plane of care of each patient.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-230082,,Arcuate fascicle lesion; MRI DTI spectrography; speech therapy; tractography,Case Reports; Review; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Patients frequently require prophylactic measures including nasogastric tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Until recently, therapy for dysphagia was limited to training with a speech and language specialist. Intraluminal pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a new technique that stimulates the pharyngeal sensory afferents to the higher swallowing center in cortex. The clinical trials published to date involved stimulation for 10 minutes over three days. We present a case of brainstem infarction with severe dysphagia in a 53-year-old woman with preserved cognitive functions. For airway protection, she had a surgical tracheotomy. The initial swallowing training achieved slight improvements, but stagnated after three months so PES was tried. Under good PES tube tolerance, a prolonged and repeated stimulation protocol was administered, with the main purpose of relieving her of the tracheal tube. Although the swallowing improved, she stayed tube-dependent with minimal attempts with puréed food during therapy, and could not be decannulated. Further studies are required to assess the value of this promising approach for the treatment of dysphagia.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci10050256,PMC7287930,dysphagia; ischemic stroke; pharyngeal electrical stimulation; rehabilitation; treatment,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Functional MRI (fMRI) is a prevalent and effective neuroimaging method that has been used to study the complex neurophysiologic control of swallowing in vivo. This article presents a summary of the research studies that have used fMRI to study the neural control of swallowing in normal subjects and dysphagic patients, and to investigate the effects of swallowing treatments on neuroplasticity. Methodologic challenges and caveats are discussed, and a case study of a pre-posttreatment paradigm is presented to highlight potential future directions of fMRI applications in swallowing research and clinical practice.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Head & neck,10.1002/hed.21903,PMC3747973,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

Dysphagia after medullary infarction was more common in patients with upper or middle medullary level and dorsolateral medullary level lesions. The common findings on videofluoroscopic swallowing studies in patients with lateral medullary infarctions were impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening, aspiration from pyriform sinuses' residue caused by pharyngeal weakness, and multiple swallowing to clear boluses from the pharynx to the esophagus. In patients with medullary infarctions, the lesion levels and loci and their related clinical findings can be useful in predicting dysphagia and aspiration.

The clinical presentation can be variable, including ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, dysphagia, and other subacute brainstem, cranial nerve, or cerebellar symptoms. These symptoms can be subacute to chronic, episodic, and progressive, making the diagnosis challenging. The hallmark radiographic magnetic resonance imaging findings are gadolinium-enhancing punctate lesions predominantly ""peppering"" the pons in a perivascular pattern. Here, we describe a case and literature review of a 74-year-old Caucasian male who presented with subacute symptoms of ataxia, diplopia, and generalized fatigue. Physical examination was notable for horizontal nystagmus and wide-based gait. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed angiocentric enhancement predominantly in the brainstem and cerebellum, with involvement of the basal ganglia, thalami, and supratentorial white matter. Meanwhile, a screening computed tomography scan demonstrated a right upper lobe mass with biopsy proving primary lung cancer. Biopsy of one of the brain lesions showed perivascular infiltrate primarily composed of CD3+ T cells, scattered CD20+ B cells, and no signs of malignancy. The patient was started on high-dose glucocorticoids followed by a maintenance regimen with rapid improvement clinically and radiographically. Given extensive work-up was negative, these clinical and radiographic findings were consistent with chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids. This case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosing chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids, given its variable presentation, lack of specific laboratory findings, and poorly understood pathogenesis.

The most frequently encountered problems are dysarthria, aphasia, dysphagia and apraxia of speech. Although these disorders are mentioned in literature, very few studies describing the occurrence in different neurological conditions are available in Indian context. Hence, a need was felt to carry out such a study. A heterogenous group of forty patients with neurological conditions were assessed for presence of speech, language and swallowing problems. A percent analysis was carried out to determine the occurrence of aphasia, dysarthria and dysphagia in general, in specific diseases and also to describe type of aphasia and dysarthria according to the characteristics presented. It was seen that the most frequently occurring disorder was dysarthria (60%), followed by dysphagia (55%) and aphasia (18%). It was also noted that dysarthria and dysphagia co-existed in around 45% patients with neurological diseases. It can be concluded that speech, language and swallowing problems are frequent in individuals with neurological conditions.

A 72-year-old White man presented with 2 weeks of low-grade fever and chills, night sweats, fatigue, dysphagia, and new-onset rapidly increasing cervical lymphadenopathy. He had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for which he was started on dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-R-EPOCH). Shortly after treatment initiation, the patient developed severe airway obstruction due to cervical lymphadenopathy that required emergency intubation. A few days later, the cervical lymphadenopathy and the status of the airway improved, and sedation was consequently weaned off to plan for extubation. However, the patient did not recover consciousness and developed generalized refractory seizures. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed edema in the cortical gray and subcortical white matter of the bilateral occipital and inferior temporal lobes, consistent with PRES. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome refers to a neurological disorder and imaging entity characterized by subcortical vasogenic edema in patients who develop acute neurological signs and symptoms of a usually reversible nature in different settings, including chemotherapy. Despite its name, PRES is not always fully reversible, and permanent sequelae can persist in some patients.

The diagnosis of rabies encephalitis was made based on a typical history of exposure, a compatible clinical presentation, and MRI findings. Rabies diagnosis is essentially clinical. It is definitively confirmed by the isolation of the virus from biological samples such as saliva, CSF, hair, or detection of rabies antigens or antibodies.

Recently, several patients with asymptomatic spontaneous intracranial hypotension were reported. I now report two patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who developed multiple arterial strokes associated with death in one patient, illustrating the spectrum of disease severity in spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Medical records and radiologic imaging of the two patients were reviewed. Case 1. A 45-year-old man presented with an orthostatic headache. Neurologic examination was normal. MRI showed bilateral subdural fluid collections, brain sagging, and pachymeningeal enhancement. At lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was too low to record. He underwent two epidural blood patches with transient improvement of symptoms. His headaches progressed and a CT-myelogram showed a lower cervical CSF leak. Subsequently, periodic lethargy and confusion was noted and he then rapidly deteriorated. Examination showed coma (GCS: 4 [E1, M2, V1]), a fixed and dilated right pupil, and decerebrate posturing. Bilateral craniotomies were performed for the evacuation of chronic subdural hematomas. Immediate postoperative CT showed bilateral posterior cerebral artery infarcts and a recurrent right subdural hematoma, requiring re-evacuation. Postoperative examination was consistent with brain death and support was withdrawn.  Case 2. A 42-year-old man presented with a non-positional headache. Neurologic examination was normal. CT showed bilateral acute on chronic subdural hematomas and effacement of the basilar cisterns. MRI showed brain sagging, bilateral subdural hematomas, and pachymeningeal enhancement. Bilateral craniotomies were performed and subdural hematomas were evacuated. Postoperatively, the patient became progressively lethargic (GCS: 8 [E2, M4, V2]) and variable degrees of pupillary asymmetry and quadriparesis were noted. MRI now also showed multiple areas of restricted diffusion in the pons and midbrain, consistent with multiple infarcts. CT showed worsening subdural fluid collections with midline shift and increased effacement of the basilar cisterns. Repeat bilateral craniotomies were performed for evacuation of the subdural fluid collections. Neurologic examination was then noted to be fluctuating but clearly improved when lying flat (GCS: 10T [E4, M6, VT]). CT-myelography demonstrated an extensive cervico-thoracic CSF leak. An epidural blood patch was performed. The patient made a good, but incomplete, recovery with residual quadriparesis and dysphagia. Arterial cerebral infarcts are rare, but potentially life-threatening complications of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. The strokes are due to downward displacement of the brain and can be precipitated by craniotomy for evacuation of associated subdural hematomas.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9800-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This case study aims to report successful effects of evidence-based therapy based on findings of dysphagia symptoms and pathophysiology of swallowing by flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) in severe isolated dysphagia after MMI. FEES was performed to evaluate swallowing pathophysiology and dysphagia symptoms in a 57-year-old male with severe dysphagia after MMI. On the basis of FEES findings, simple and high-frequent evidence-based exercises for improvement of swallowing were implemented: thermal stimulation of faucial arches, Jaw Opening Exercise, and Jaw Opening Against Resistance. After 7 weeks of high-frequent evidence-based therapy and regular FEES evaluation the patient was set on full oral diet with no evidence of aspiration risk. In a first case report of isolated dysphagia in MMI our case illustrates that high-frequent evidence-based dysphagia therapy in combination with FEES as the method to evaluate and monitor swallowing pathophysiology can lead to successful and quick rehabilitation of severely affected dysphagic patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513676,PMC8077515,Case report; Dysphagia; Dysphagia therapy; Evidence-based therapy; Flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing; Medial medullary infarction,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Myotomy of the CP muscle was the treatment of choice. Recently, botulinum toxin type A (BtxA) has been used for CP spasm. It usually brings improvement in deglutition but most patients require reinjection in 3-5 months. We report a 35-year-old man who had an arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage in the brain stem resulting in CP spasm and consequently severe dysphagia. He received BtxA injection and deglutition and nutrition remained good one year after treatment. A literature review analyzing 28 patients and our patient showed negative correlations between age and BtxA dose and between age and duration. Efficacy was positively correlated with duration and BtxA dose was positively correlated with pretreatment severity. In conclusion, physicians would use higher doses on patients with more severe cases but use lower doses on older patients. Those who obtained better post-treatment results would enjoy longer effective duration. Thus, the effective duration of the BtxA is multifactorial.",{},,Dysphagia,10.1007/s00455-003-0029-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The background pathology of CBS is commonly a variety of proteinopathies, but association with cerebrovascular disease has also been reported. Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome (FCMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by facio-pharyngo-glossal diplegia with automatic-voluntary movement dissociation presenting with bilateral paresis of the facial, lingual, pharyngeal and masticatory muscles. FCMS is commonly attributable to stroke. Transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) proteinopathy is also known as the pathological background of FCMS, while the pathological background of the majority of CBS cases consists of diverse tauopathies instead of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In this report, we describe a case mimicking FCMS that was finally diagnosed as CBS with suggested 4-repeat tauopathy. A 68-year-old female started experiencing difficulty speaking followed by difficulty writing, and especially texting, several years before her visit. Her impairment had been gradually worsening, and she came to our hospital. On neurological examination, she demonstrated the facial apraxia, frontal lobe dysfunction, and upper motor neuron signs. She presented some characteristics suggestive of FCMS. Her symptoms exhibited rapid progression and myoclonus, parkinsonism, and left-side dominant cortical sensory deficit occurred, resulting in the fulfillment of diagnostic criteria for CBS after 9 months. Tau PET imaging displayed notable ligand uptake in the brainstem, subthalamic nuclei, basal ganglia, and bilateral subcortical frontal lobe, suggesting that her pathological background was 4-repeat tauopathy. As a result of her progressive dysphagia, she became unable to eat and passed away after 12 months. We hereby present an atypical case of CBS showing clinical features mimicking FCMS at first presentation. TDP-43 proteinopathy was suspected based on the clinical symptoms in the early stages of the disease; however, the clinical course and imaging findings including tau PET suggested that her pathological background was 4-repeat tauopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMC geriatrics,10.1186/s12877-023-04564-z,PMC10714444,Aphasia; Corticobasal syndrome; Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome; Tau PET,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

She was admitted to the hospital due to nausea and lightheadedness. Upon admission, she was diagnosed with bilateral medial medullary infarcts. She received treatment with intravenous edaravone and argatroban, as well as antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. However, her dysphagia, dysarthria, and paraplegia worsened. Due to changes in the lesion of the basilar artery on brain ‍MRA, we suspected the possibility of basilar artery dissection, and discontinued antiplatelet therapy. Subsequent imaging studies suggested vasculitis. After examining the cerebrospinal fluid, we diagnosed varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vasculopathy. Based on this diagnosis, we administered steroid pulse therapy for three days, started intravenous acyclovir, and resumed antithrombotic therapy with clopidogrel. Prednisone was administered for five days. Biochemical tests revealed an elevated D-dimer level. Due to the presence of lower extremity venous thrombus, clopidogrel was replaced with apixaban. The acyclovir infusion was discontinued due to observed acyclovir-induced neutropenia. These treatments improved neurological symptoms, circumflex thickening of the basilar artery, and contrast effects in the same area. On the 70th day, the patient was transferred to the hospital for rehabilitation. It is important to consider VZV angiopathy as a potential cause of juvenile cerebral infarction accompanying progressive basilar artery stenosis, regardless of the presence or absence of a skin rash.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001973,,juvenile cerebral infarction; varicella-zoster virus; varicella-zoster virus vasculopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; English Abstract,Japan,jpn
32755487,Respiratory-Swallow Coordination Training Improves Swallowing Safety and Efficiency in a Person With Anoxic Brain Injury.,"Curtis, James A; Seikaly, Zeina N; Troche, Michelle S",Curtis,"Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the effects of respiratory-swallow coordination training (RSCT) on respiratory-swallow coordination (RSC), swallowing safety (penetration/aspiration), and swallowing efficiency (pharyngeal residue) in a person with anoxic brain injury. Method A 68-year-old man with anoxic brain injury, tachypnea, and severe dysphagia was recruited to participate in a prospective AABAA single-subject experimental design. RSC, swallowing safety, and swallowing efficiency were measured at each assessment using respiratory inductive plethysmography and flexible endoscopic evaluations of swallowing. Data were analyzed descriptively using Cohen's <i>d</i> effect size. Outcome measures were compared pre-RSCT to post-RSCT, and pre-RSCT to a 1-month retention assessment. Results Improvements in RSC were observed immediately post-RSCT (<i>d</i> = 0.60). These improvements were maintained upon retention assessment 1 month later (<i>d</i> = 0.60). Additionally, improvements in swallowing safety (<i>d</i> = 1.73), efficiency (<i>d</i> = 1.73), and overall dysphagia severity (<i>d</i> = 1.73) were observed immediately post-RSCT and were maintained upon retention assessment 1 month later (<i>d</i> = 1.73). Conclusions Clinically meaningful improvements in RSC were observed following four sessions of RSCT, which were subsequently associated with large improvements in swallowing safety and efficiency. RSCT may be an efficacious, clinically feasible skill-based exercise for people with anoxic brain injury, suboptimal RSC, and dysphagia. Future work is needed to expand these findings in a larger cohort of people with dysphagia.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,American journal of speech-language pathology,10.1044/2020_AJSLP-20-00095,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 17-year-old male patient presented with acute onset of headache, facial numbness, and tingling. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing lesion in the pons consistent with a cavernous malformation. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had 2 additional episodes of acutely worsening neurological deficits that left him with left-sided hemiparesis, a right sixth nerve palsy, and dysphagia. A purely endoscopic, endonasal, transclival approach was used to resect the cavernoma. Postoperatively, he had a transient worsening of his left-side motor function and restricted horizontal gaze, but at the last follow-up, his hemiparesis had improved and his magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a radiographic cure. He developed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak despite prophylactic lumbar CSF drainage for 2 days and the use of bilateral vascularized nasoseptal flaps. The CSF leak was repaired with CSF diversion and a second surgical procedure; at the last follow-up, he had no recurrence of the leak.

To document the clinical, neuropsychological, and radiological features of six cases of cognitive presentation of multiple sclerosis, to review the relevant literature, and to propose a possible cortical basis for this clinical presentation. Six patients (five women; age range 38 to 60 years) presented to the memory and cognitive disorders clinic in Cambridge with an initially undiagnosed cognitive/neuropsychiatric syndrome. All underwent neuropsychological evaluation, brain imaging, and ancillary investigations to establish a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The six cases all had a progressive dementia syndrome with prominent amnesia, often accompanied by classic cortical features including dysphasia, dysgraphia, or dyslexia. Mood disturbance was ubiquitous and in three patients there was a long history of preceding severe depression. All six developed characteristic physical signs on follow up, with marked disabilities. A review of 17 previously reported cases highlighted the prominence of memory impairment and depression in the early stages. On clinical, pathological, and radiological grounds, the neuropsychiatric presentation of multiple sclerosis may represent a clinicopathological entity of ""cortical multiple sclerosis."" Failure to recognise this will delay diagnosis and may expose patients to potentially dangerous and invasive investigation.

Complications and impairments include difficulty swallowing or eating, communication difficulties (both receptive and expressive), emotional changes, loss of bladder or bowel control, muscle and nerve diseases, and language, speech, and memory problems. A patient-centered approach to rehabilitation interventions was given. The patient's functional ability was greatly enhanced due to the physiotherapy rehabilitation we used. Effective rehabilitation has taken advantage of the brain's capacity for repair and recovery.

We describe the first reported case of a patient receiving full-dose intravenous (IV) alteplase for AIS after heparin reversal with protamine. A 73-year-old man presented with AIS. He was treated with IV heparin, tirofiban, loading-dose prasugrel, and aspirin before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for placement of a right coronary artery stent. One hour following PCI, he abruptly developed left hemiparesis and dysphagia. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 12, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was longer than 150 seconds. Head computed tomography (CT) showed no acute pathology, and CT angiogram showed no large-vessel occlusion amenable to mechanical thrombectomy. Repeat aPTT, obtained 45 minutes later, was 110 seconds, at which time protamine 40 mg IV was administered. At 144 minutes from last known well time, full-dose IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) was administered. Follow-up head imaging at 25 hours showed right pontine and cerebellar AIS with no evidence of hemorrhage. The patient was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation 2 days later. Modified Rankin Scale at 3 months was 3, improved from 5 at discharge. Given the lack of adverse events associated with IV alteplase in our patient, we advocate cautious evaluation for potential reversal of acutely administered anticoagulation to facilitate alteplase administration in severely disabled patients who are not eligible for mechanical intervention and would have been excluded from definitive AIS treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Pharmacotherapy,10.1002/phar.1997,,alteplase; heparin; protamine; reversal; stroke; thrombolytics; unfractionated heparin,Case Reports,United States,eng

Patients were divided into four treatment groups: the unaffected hemispheric group, the affected hemispheric group, the cerebellum group and the control group. Each group received traditional dysphagia treatment 5 days a week for 2 weeks. All recruited patients except for those in the control group underwent 10 consecutive rTMS sessions for 2 weeks. For the affected hemispheric group and unaffected hemispheric group, 5 Hz rTMS was applied to the affected mylohyoid cortical region or to the unaffected mylohyoid cortical region. For the cerebellum group, 5 Hz rTMS was applied to the mylohyoid cortical representation of the cerebellum (4.3 cm lateral and 2.4 cm below the inion). The Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS), Penetration/Aspiration Scale (PAS), Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS), and Standardized Swallowing Assessment (SSA) were used to evaluate clinical swallowing function before the intervention (baseline), immediately after the intervention and 2 weeks after the intervention. <b>Results:</b> There were significant time and intervention interaction effects on the FEDSS, PAS, SSA, and GUSS scores (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

Application of endovascular interventions is limited due to substantial brainstem compression and cranial nerve neuropathy. Combined endovascular exclusion and microsurgical excision provides an approach to treatment of these lesions. A 48-year-old female patient presented with progressive complaints of ataxia, diplopia in left lateral gaze, and dysphagia. Imaging studies (CT, MRI, angiography) revealed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the right vertebral artery and pronounced brainstem compression. The initial phase of treatment involved endovascular occlusion of the vertebral artery and aneurysm trapping that did not lead to changes in the postoperative patient's neurological status. MRI demonstrated complete aneurysm thrombosis and a weak TOF signal in the vertebral artery near the proximal aneurysm neck region. Because of persistent brainstem compression, the patient underwent right suboccipital craniectomy and hemilaminectomy of the CI arch for aneurysm excision one week after endovascular occlusion. After isolating the aneurysmal sac, the vertebral artery was transected, and two small branches extending from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem were also coagulated and transected, followed by aneurysm excision. Numerous vasa vasorum in the wall of the proximal vertebral artery and aneurysm neck were coagulated to stop bleeding. After surgery, the patient developed neurological symptoms (right leg ataxia and dysphagia worsening) due to lateral medullary infarction (confirmed by MRI) that presumably resulted from coagulation of two small perforating branches coming from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem. Recovery of the patient's neurological functions was observed during conservative treatment. The patient was discharged with mild right leg ataxia and preoperative left-sided abducens paresis.

On admission to the stroke unit, she had Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of 8, and a negative screening test for dysphagia, dysphasia, and right-sided hemiparesis. After 16 h of admission, dyspnea suddenly occurred with a decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> (72%). X-ray of the lungs showed less ventilated areas of the lung due to aspiration pneumonia and a broad disfigured shadow of the anterior mediastinum on the base of the lusoria artery. Dysphagia lusoria was confirmed by spiral computed tomography angiography.

34909307,Thrombolytic Therapy in the Oldest Old: Successful Alteplase Administration in a 105-Year-Old Female With Ischemic Stroke.,"Bhandari, Sambhawana; Baral, Maun R; Espana Schmidt, Christian",Bhandari,"The elderly have a higher incidence of ischemic stroke along with higher mortality and morbidity compared to their younger counterparts. However, though studies have included people >85 or 90 years of age, there haven't been reports of many individuals above 100 years of age. Among the oldest old, the oldest age studied for alteplase administration is possibly 101 years. We present a case of a 105-year-old woman with a medical history of a cerebrovascular accident in 2018 for which she received thrombolytic therapy with residual slurred speech and mild dysphagia. She was brought in from her nursing facility for worsening of slurred speech and right facial droop that began two hours before presentation to the emergency department. She was found to have aphasia, left-sided gaze preference, and upper motor neuron dysfunction of her right arm associated with drift. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation was 17. An urgent CT scan of the head was performed that did not show any evidence of acute bleeding. CT angiogram of brain and neck was unremarkable with no evidence of high-grade stenosis, aneurysm, occlusion, or dissection. With the negative CT findings, the patient received thrombolytic therapy with alteplase<i>. </i>She was monitored in the intensive care unit for 24 hours after alteplase administration with neurological checks every one hour. The repeated CT head after 24 hours was negative for any hemorrhage. She was discharged after two days of hospital admission and her NIHSS score on the day of discharge was 4. Our patient was 105 years old, which is arguably one of the oldest ages to receive alteplase.

37780717,Acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome with a thalamic lesion and COVID-19: a case report and discussion on mechanism.,"Geng, Na; Wang, Pengfei; Zhang, Yong",Geng,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory system. During the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19-associated neurological diseases have been increasingly reported, including peripheral nervous system diseases, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Acute motor-sensory axonal polyneuropathy (AMSAN), is a GBS variant associated with COVID-19. To date, there are no reports of GBS cases with thalamic injury and dynamic evolution with fluctuating GBS symptoms. In this report, we describe the first case of COVID-19-associated AMSAN accompanied by a thalamic lesion and discuss the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. A 76-year-old woman, with known co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented to the emergency room with complaints of weakness and paraesthesia in both her legs and arms for 4 days, and fever and dry cough for the past 5 days. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. The patient had not received specific treatment for COVID-19 infection. Neurological examination disclosed symmetric weakness (Medical Research Council grade upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 2/5) and areflexia in both the legs and feet. No cranial nerves were involved. Following a neuro-electro-physiology study to evaluate neurological symptoms, AMSAN was suggested. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein levels that confirmed the diagnosis of GBS. The patient was subsequently treated with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), which improved her neurological symptoms (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5). However, urinary retention, dysarthria, dysphagia, bilateral facial paralysis, facial diplegia, bucking, and motor alalia gradually appeared, followed by aggravated paralysis (upper limbs 3/5, lowers limbs 1/5). After being hospitalized for 16 days, the patient underwent continuous plasma exchange (PE) treatment for a duration of 3 days. Following treatment, the patient's neurological symptoms and paralysis gradually improved (upper limbs 4/5, lowers limbs 4/5) over 2 weeks. Meanwhile, we observed that the patient's cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings dynamically evolved along with the fluctuation of her GBS symptoms, mainly in terms of the changes in T2 hyperintensity in the right thalamus accompanied by microhaemorrhages. The inflammation index was normal. We considered a wide range of possible causes including hypoxia, drugs, toxins, and metabolic derangements but these were excluded. The AMSAN variant of GBS secondary to COVID-19 infection is severe and can cause extensive damage to the peripheral nerves system. The deterioration of symptoms in the patient after early immunotherapy may indicate treatment-related fluctuation (TRF) and could be attributed to immune rebound. Moreover, an excessive immune response post-COVID-19 infection may trigger concurrent damage to the central nervous system, indicating secondary harm to brain small blood vessels and nerve units. For suspected cases of GBS complicated by COVID-19, it is essential to conduct early brain MRI examinations in addition to routine peripheral nervous system evaluations to promptly detect any intracranial lesions. This facilitates appropriate immunotherapy and improves patient prognosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.1227505,PMC10539899,COVID-19; Guillain-Barré syndrome; MRI findings; neuro-electrophysiological characteristics; thalamic lesion,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Persistent symptoms prompted esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which was unremarkable. She developed diffuse weakness and impaired memory with poor orientation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity at the central pons and bilateral thalami. Her mental status continued to worsen rapidly within a few days, and she became minimally responsive, hypothermic, and hypotensive; as such, she was intubated for airway protection. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. She received a thiamine replacement. Repeat MRI after a few days showed improving thalamic hyperintensities with improvement in mentation.

We report two patients with dysphagia due to LMS and propose a novel technique named hyoid-complex elevation and stimulation technique (known as HEST). The two patients had no other functional incapacity back into life, but nasogastric feeding was the only possible way for nutrition because of severe aspirations. Swallowing function was evaluated by functional oral intake scale, modified water swallow test, surface electromyographic signal associated with video fluorography swallowing study to assess the situation of aspiration, pharyngeal residue, pharyngeal peristalsis, upper esophageal opening and the ability of deglutition.

Complete occlusion of the aneurysm was successfully achieved. However, subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) conducted 8 months after the procedure showed perilesional edematous changes surrounding the aneurysm, and at 20 months, cyst formation was observed in the vicinity of the aneurysm. Progressive enlargement of the cyst eventually led to the development of paralysis and dysphagia, necessitating cyst fenestration surgery. Although postoperative reduction in the cyst size was achieved, the patient experienced complications in the form of aspiration pneumonia and bacterial meningitis, which resulted in a life-threatening condition.

At age 48 years, the patient had the left part of his tongue removed because of cancer. Twenty-two years later, he developed dysphagia and right hemiplegia after a cerebral hemorrhage. The patient was diagnosed with sarcopenia based on a low left handgrip strength (10 kg) and reduced calf circumference (26.5 cm). The patient's Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) score was 1, and his tongue muscle mass indicated atrophy, making the maximum tongue pressure difficult to measure. Palatal augmentation prostheses (PAP) were made to increase swallowing and tongue pressures, and nutritional intake was changed from nasal tube feeding to a gastric fistula. Nutritional intake was increased to 2400 kcal/day and protein intake to 96 g/day. Although rehabilitation nutrition using PAP improved the patient's nutritional status, the dysphagia did not improve, and therefore he underwent glottal closure.

A case series.,"Hammerle, Matt H; Treleaven, Julia M",Hammerle,"The neck has been implicated as a potential generator of symptoms such as dizziness and headache in individuals with persistent symptoms post concussion. Anatomically, the neck could also be a potential trigger for autonomic or cranial nerve symptoms. The glossopharyngeal nerve which innervates the upper pharynx is one possible autonomic trigger that might be affected by the upper cervical spine. This is a case series of three individuals with persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH) and symptoms of autonomic dysregulation who also had signs of intermittent glossopharyngeal nerve irritation associated with certain neck positions or movements. Biomechanical principles were applied to anatomical research on the path of the glossopharyngeal nerve, in relation to the upper cervical spine and the dura mater, to alleviate these intermittent symptoms. The patients were provided techniques to be used as tools to immediately alleviate the intermittent dysphagia, which also alleviated the constant headache at the same time. As part of the overall long-term management program, patients were also taught daily exercises to improve upper cervical and dural stability and mobility. The result was a decrease in intermittent dysphagia, headache, and autonomic symptoms in the long term in persons with PPTH following concussion.

The patient had past medical history of chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Prior to admission, the patient was treated for ischemic stroke of left basal ganglia but continued to have worsening encephalopathy. The spinal tap revealed a 14-3-3 protein level of thirteen times the upper limit of normal; electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a diffuse slowing of the background and periodic sharp waves with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of admission showed extensive signal abnormality in the basal ganglia bilaterally and in the cerebral cortex bilaterally, particularly over the left cerebral hemisphere. The persistence of the MRI findings over several weeks was concerning for spongiform encephalopathy. The probable diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was made based on these imaging findings taken together with the patient's clinical signs and symptoms of a rapidly progressive encephalopathy. The patient was able to have some quality time with his family as the diagnosis was made earlier than perhaps otherwise and expired peacefully after comfort care measures were chosen.

Several studies have shown that tPBM can help individuals with stroke or traumatic brain injury achieve significant cognitive improvements. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A 38-year-old female, who sustained an ischemic stroke on the left side of the brain, received two, 5-month series of treatments. The first series of treatments included traditional speech-language therapy, for the first 5 months poststroke. The second series of treatments included tPBM in combination with speech-language therapy, for the next 5 months. The tPBM treatments included application of red (630 and 660 nm) and near-infrared (850 nm) wavelengths of photons applied to left hemisphere scalp areas. The major cortical language areas were subjacent to the scalp placements along the line of the Sylvian fissure. At each session, first a light-emitting diode (LED) cluster head with red (630 and 660 nm) and near-infrared (850 nm) wavelengths, with an irradiance (power density) of 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, a beam size of 4.9 cm<sup>2</sup>, and a fluence (energy density) of 12 J/cm<sup>2</sup> per minute, was applied to the left side of the scalp/brain, along the Sylvian fissure for 60 sec at each at the following eight, language network target areas: frontal pole, prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area); supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus in the parietal lobe; inferior motor/sensory cortex (mouth area); and posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and superior temporal sulcus in the temporal lobe, for a total of 8 min.

This helmet contained 256 separate LED lights, near-infrared (810 nm) wavelength, 60 mW power per LED light, total power, 15 W; energy, 72 Joules; fluence, 28.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>; and irradiance, 24 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. <b><i>Results and conclusions:</i></b> During the initial, 5-month treatment series with traditional speech-language therapy only, there was little to no improvement in dysarthria and expressive language. During the second, 5-month treatment series, however, with tPBM applied first, to the left hemisphere only, and second, to both hemispheres during each session plus simultaneous speech-language therapy, there was marked improvement in the dysarthria and expressive language. After the first 5-month series, this PWA had utilized a slow rate of speech with a production of ∼25 to 30 words-per-minute during conversations and spontaneous speech. Utterance length was only 4-6 words with simple, grammatical structure. After the second, 5-month series of treatment combining tPBM plus speech-language therapy, the rate of speech increased to 80+ words-per-minute and utterance length was increased to 9-10 words, with more complex grammatical structure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",10.1089/photob.2022.0024,PMC10171962,LLLT; PBM; aphasia; low-level laser therapy; photobiomodulation; speech-language therapy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Oxygen administration reduced the apnoea-hypopnoea index from 30.1 to 20.0 per hour. Sustained periodic breathing under normoxaemia suggested that the brainstem lesion, rather than peripheral factors such as prolonged lung-chemoreceptor circulatory delay, was responsible for the abnormal breathing.

Oral myiasis occurs when soft tissues of the oral cavity are invaded by the larvae of flies. It is not a common disease for the reason that the oral cavity is not easily reachable for the fly to lay eggs. But it can cause pain, infection, uncomfortable feeling when the worms move, tissue destruction and/or even life-threatening hemorrhages. We reported a case of oral myiasis after cerebral infarction in a 78-year-old male patient from southern China (Guangdong Zhanjiang). As a result of cerebral infarction, he suffered from right hemiplegia, mobility and mental decline for about 3 mo. He had difficulty swallowing and was fed <i>via</i> a feeding tube. He mostly engaged in mouth breathing and had poor oral and dental hygiene. More than 20 live larvae were collected from the patient's oral cavity, which were localized in the maxillary gingiva, the mandibular gingiva and the tongue. The patient recovered after the routine oral cleaning, removal of maggots, debridement and anti-infection treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of this infestation are essential due to the bothersome symptoms, such as inflammation, intense anxiety over the larvae movement, possible serious complications, <i>etc</i>.

Here, we present a rare case of a brainstem cavernoma that was surgically resected whereafter an upbeat nystagmus presented postoperatively. A 42-year old man presented with sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, vertigo, blurred vision, marked imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Neurological evaluation showed bilateral ataxia, generalized hyperreflexia with left-sided predominance, predominantly horizontal gaze evoked nystagmus on right and left gaze, slight left labial asymmetry, uvula deviation to the right, and tongue deviation to the left. MRI demonstrated a 13-mm cavernoma with haemorrhage and oedema in the medulla oblongata. Surgery was performed via a minimal-invasive, midline approach. Complete excision was confirmed on postoperative MRI. The patient recovered well and became almost neurologically intact. However, he complained of mainly vertical oscillopsia. The videonystagmography revealed a new-onset spontaneous upbeat nystagmus in all gaze directions, not suppressed by fixation. An injury of the rarely described intercalatus nucleus/nucleus of Roller is thought to be the cause. Upbeat nystagmus can be related to several lesions of the brainstem, including the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the pons, and the dorsal medulla. To our knowledge, this is the first case of an iatrogenic lesion of the nucleus intercalatus/nucleus of Roller resulting in an upbeat vertical nystagmus.

Giardini 1455, Modena, Italy, Tel: 39-3497325802, Email: giulianagalassi46@gmail.com Abstract: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection and reactivation are associated with a number of neurologic conditions. Unifocal large vessel infarcts may follow zoster in the trigeminal or cervical distribution as a result of transaxonal transport of virus from trigeminal or cervical afferent fibers that innervate vessels. Ophthalmic zoster (HZO) might cause ophthalmoplegic syndromes, with secondary optic neuritis. Mechanisms include local orbital muscle inflammation and, viral spread from the ophthalmic branch of the fifth nerve with associated vasculopathy. A 72-year-old man developed a vesicular rash in the territory of C5-T5-6. Within four weeks, the patient developed headache, dysphagia, left facial and extremity ataxic weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right pontine infarction. A 66-year-old woman presented with right-sided painfull HZO. One week later she developed complete external ophthalmoplegia and blurred vision. MRI showed ill-defined signal alteration in the retrobulbar tissue. Three weeks later, the patient was admitted because of dysarthria, deviated tongue, left-sided limb weakness, and tactile hypoesthesia. Spinal fluid contained 23 lymphocytes/mm3 and increased protein. The serum contained antibodies to VZV IgG and IgM in both cases. The patients received intravenously acyclovir with improvement. This report confirms unusual occurrence of ipsilateral brainstem stroke after VZV reactivation in immunocompetent subjects.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Dermatology online journal,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Currently, the accepted management of these tumors is attempted total surgical excision when technically possible and associated with an acceptable risk. However, radiation therapy has been shown to provide excellent local control when used either as an adjunct to surgery or as a primary treatment. We present a case report of a 46-year-old female patient with an unresectable left foramen magnum meningioma resulting in headaches, neck pain, and swallowing difficulty. The patient underwent CyberKnife (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery to a dose of 3,000 cGy in five fractions in March 2011. The patient tolerated treatment without complications and has remained clinically well with no ongoing cranial nerve deficits as of the last examination in late 2019.

The objective of this article was to describe unique myoclonic vocal fold movement disorder, which is an unusual post-stroke manifestation. A retrospective case study. The study group included post-stroke patients with dysphagia who were referred to the Swallowing Clinic at Edith Wolfson Medical Center. All patients underwent flexible laryngoscopy and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing. The vocal fold movement was analyzed with the Sisson-Ammons video analysis system. Three post-pontine stroke patients presented with vocal fold myoclonus (VFM). The myoclonus was spontaneous, unintentional, and irregular (19-420 jerks per minute). Two patients presented with unilateral myoclonus, ipsilateral to the brainstem stroke. One patient, who experienced subsequent pontine strokes, presented with bilateral VFM. When patients were asked to swallow or phonate, the myoclonus disappeared. Isolated VFM is an unusual manifestation of pontine injury, resulting in a sudden, involuntary, and non-rhythmic vocal fold movement. This laryngeal pathology is not associated with either dyspnea or dysphonia and most likely not with inefficient swallowing.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,10.1016/j.jvoice.2012.07.013,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Six months after stroke onset, the FIM motor score had improved to 38 points and the dysphagia to FILS Level 7. The patient was able to ingest easy-to-swallow food orally three times a day, but only after postural adjustment with rotation of the head. Seven months after stroke onset, the FIM motor score had reached 45 points but without further improvement in swallowing function. Videofluoroscopic swallowing evaluation (VF) revealed that the persistence of dysphagia was due to osteophytes on the cervical vertebrae caused by diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. On surgical removal of the osteophytes, swallowing function improved to FILS Level 9; the patient was able to ingest normal food in a seated position without postural adjustment. One year after stroke onset, the patient was discharged with an FIM motor score of 59 points and FILS Level 9. At the 2-year follow-up, there was minimal recurrence of the osteophytes, and both motor and swallowing functions were maintained at the same level as at discharge. This case suggests that dysphagia in elderly patients may be due to multiple disorders, and that surgical intervention may occasionally be effective.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,NMC case report journal,10.2176/nmccrj.cr.2016-0024,PMC5386171,Forestier’s disease; cerebrovascular; comorbidity; orthopedics; prognosis,Case Reports,Japan,eng

The diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed based on the syphilis diagnosis test and the syphilis rapid test. He was given anti-syphilis treatment, but the above symptoms gradually worsened. Anti-NMDAR antibody was positive in cerebrospinal fluid but was negative in serum. Due to the cerebrospinal fluid findings, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was a consideration. According to the patient's weight, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g QD for 5 d, with the dose gradually decreased for 6 mo, and immunoglobulin 25 g QD for 5 d; his symptoms improved after treatment.

A clinical and radiological diagnosis of bilateral anterior frontal opercular syndrome (Foix-Chavany-Marie-syndrome) was made.Deglutition consists of a voluntary oral stage and an involuntary pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. As involuntary movements were relatively preserved and no sensory loss was suspected, it was hypothesised that, once initiated or triggered, pharyngeal swallowing could be adequate. This was trialled at the bedside without adverse effects and subsequently videofluoroscopy demonstrated timely laryngeal elevation and closure, adequate opening of the upper oesophageal sphincter and smooth transit of the bolus from mouth to oesophagus.

Surgical treatment options for a fusiform aneurysm in the PICA include trapping with/without bypass and wrap-clipping, when elimination of the pathological wall from the systemic circulation and prevention of perforator injury are important. In addition, lower cranial nerve impairment due to surgical manipulation should also be avoided. A fusiform-shaped aneurysm was found in a proximal part of the PICA by magnetic resonance angiography undertaken for evaluation of repeated vertigo in a 36-year-old man. The patient underwent direct surgery via a lateral suboccipital transcondylar fossa approach. The entrance of the pseudolumen was the only part to be wrapped and obstructed by clip application, through the corridor between the acoustic and glossopharyngeal nerves to avoid lower cranial nerve injury. Indocyanine green (ICG) videoangiography demonstrated obliteration of pseudolumen and patency of peripheral PICA and perforator contributing to the medulla oblongata. The postoperative course was uneventful without periprocedural complications, including dysphagia and hoarseness. Partial wrap-clipping technique for obstruction of the entrance into a pseudolumen is one of alternatives for dissecting fusiform-shaped aneurysm in the PICA. ICG videoangiography was helpful to confirm the obliteration of the pseudolumen and patency of parent vessel and perforators.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-017-3099-y,PMC5385199,Dissecting aneurysm; Fusiform aneurysm; Indocyanine green videoangiography; Partial wrap-clipping technique,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

Unfortunately, there are few publications concerning long term follow up of patients with these types of injuries. We present a case of trans-orbital penetrating brain injury with an 18 year follow up. A 43-year-old, previously healthy, male was accidently impaled on a fencing foil resulting in a penetrating brain injury. Initial symptoms included diplopia, ophthalmoparesis, a non-reactive pupil, decreased visual acuity, decreased sensation across the cheek, dysphagia and dysarthria. CT scan taken on presentation showed a clear tract of the foil traversing the various structures of the brain. One week after the trauma, the patient developed a unique constellation of paroxysmal attacks of autonomic dysfunction consisting of profuse diaphoresis and decreased skin temperature on the left side of the body, as well as dilation of the left pupil. Three months after the accident, the patient suddenly experienced severe constant pain affecting the left side of his body associated with thermal and tactile allodynia. On latest follow up, 18 years after the accident, the patient continues to have chronic pain, allodynia, and lack of temperature sensation throughout the left face, arm, and leg. He has a wide based, hemi-ataxic gait, with the left leg swinging out and around. EMG and nerve conduction studies have found no voluntary activity in the temporalis and masseter muscles resulting in atrophy and fibrosis. An MRI shows linear encephalomalacia along the path of the foil extending to the pons, involving the right spinothalamic tract, and cerebellum. Our case illustrates the importance of such a longitudinal follow up. It demonstrates the possible severity of the sequelae from these types of injuries including chronic pain and gait ataxia, as well as EOM and autonomic dysfunction.

A 68-year-old man was started on rehabilitation exercise 3 months after onset of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, due to remnant dysarthria and dysphagia (Functional Oral Intake Scale, level 5) after the cardinal signs of Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis resolved. Exercise involved using a straw in the anterior midline between the dorsal tongue and hard palate. While the patient was inhaling through the straw, the straw was blocked. After strengthening suction as much as possible, the patient was asked to immediately dry swallow at the same time that suction was stopped. Effects of exercise were examined using videofluorographic swallowing studies before and after 6 weeks of training to compare posterior and superior velar displacements and the presence of nasopharyngeal reflux. No adverse effects of exercise were encountered, and Functional Oral Intake Scale improved to level 7, with significant increases in posterior and superior velar displacement during swallowing compared with before training. In addition, nasopharyngeal reflux that had consistently been seen on swallowing before training was absent after 6 weeks of exercise. This exercise method may prove useful.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

She had previously been healthy and had her first focal motor seizure at 5 years of age, which was controlled with intravenous phenytoin and rectal diazepam. Twenty-four hours later, she developed partial SE consisting of right facial twitching and right-hand clonic movements. These uncontrollable seizures lasted for 5 days, after which the partial SE changed to generalized SE, and the seizures continued for another 5 days. CT performed the day before onset of SE revealed no brain abnormality. Another CT performed a year later disclosed bilateral brain lesions, more severe in the left hemisphere. Follow up at 16 years of age revealed moderate motor sequelae of the right-hand side of the body, anarthria, difficulty chewing, dysphagia, bilateral facial weakness, and drooling, all of which clinically characterize opercular syndrome. An MRI study performed at 14 years of age showed a cerebral parenchymatous lesion which extended between the parietal cortices of both hemispheres, more severe on the left side, and which crossed the corpus callosum, destroying the posterior-middle zone. Evidence from the CT indicates that the lesion was not present before onset of SE. It seems likely that the focal SE caused the focal brain damage, but the possibility that the subsequent generalized SE played a role cannot be excluded.",{},,Developmental medicine and child neurology,10.1017/s0012162299000894,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Blood analysis at admission showed that no pituitary deficits existed. At admission, the patient presented: spastic tetraplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia, very severe cognitive deficits and joint deformities. Computerized tomography scanners (CT-Scans) revealed the practical loss of the right brain hemisphere and important injuries in the left one.

The patient presented with migraine headaches. A magnetic resonance image of the brain obtained during the headache workup revealed a right posterior carotid artery wall aneurysm in the region of the anterior choroidal artery (AChA). On digital subtraction angiograms, the lesion measured 3.5 mm at its largest diameter. Because of the irregular shape of the aneurysm, the patient's relatively young age, and the potential for further aneurysm growth due to collagen disease, surgical clip application was recommended following a discussion of available treatment options. At surgery, the aneurysm was identified as bilobed and broad based, and the AChA was found to be associated with the aneurysm neck. Satisfactory clipping of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent vessels. An association of CREST syndrome with intracranial aneurysms has only been reported once before. This case is presented to draw attention to the possibility of a pathophysiological connection between CREST syndrome and intracranial aneurysms and to postulate a possible mechanism whereby this condition may result in aneurysm formation. The association of aneurysms with other pathological collagen-related conditions is well known, and literature relevant to a possible connection between CREST syndrome and aneurysms is reviewed and discussed.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2004.101.5.0854,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It often causes serious complications, which are preventable if dysphagia is properly managed. There is growing debate concerning the usefulness of non-invasive neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in treating swallowing dysfunction. Aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Vitalstim© device, and to investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying functional recovery. A 34-year-old man, affected by severe chronic dysphagia following traumatic brain injury, underwent two different intensive rehabilitation trainings, including either conventional rehabilitation alone or coupled to Vitalstim training. We evaluated patient swallowing function in two separate sessions (i.e. before and after the two trainings) by means of ad hoc swallowing function scales and electrophysiological parameters (rapid paired associative stimulation). The overall Vitalstim program was articulated in 6 weekly sessions for 6 weeks. The patient did not report any side-effect either during or following both the intensive rehabilitation trainings. We observed an important improvement in swallowing function only after Vitalstim training. In fact, the patient was eventually able to safely eat even solid food. This is the first report objectively suggesting (by means of rPAS) a correlation between the brain neuroplastic changes induced by Vitalstim and the swallowing function improvement. It is hypothesizable that Vitalstim may have targeted cortical (and maybe subcortical) brain areas that are recruited during the highly coordinated function of swallowing, and it may have thus potentiated the well-known neuroplastic changes induced by repetitive and intensive swallowing exercises, probably thanks to metaplasticity phenomena.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-151295,,Metaplasticity; NMES; PAS; neurogenic dysphagia; vitalstim,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Cortically targeted repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a technique which has been shown to result in beneficial electrophysiological and behavioral changes in healthy participants and patients with post stroke dysphagia. Cerebellar rTMS is a relatively unstudied area of this emerging field. Here we apply cerebellar targeted rTMS to a patient with post stroke dysphagia in an attempt to improve their swallowing. A 67-year-old woman with post stroke dysphagia was recruited to undergo a crossover active rTMS vs sham rTMS study. Outcome measures were pharyngeal motor evoked potential (PMEP) amplitude and cumulative penetration-aspiration score (cPAS). The patient attended the laboratory on two occasions. During each attendance, baseline PMEP and cPAS measurements were acquired followed by either active or sham rTMS. Following this, PMEP and cPAS measurements were repeated at 30 minutes. Active cerebellar rTMS was able to increase both PMEP amplitude (55% over baseline) and improve swallowing safety (17% below baseline). Sham rTMS did not result in any beneficial PMEP or cPAS changes.

8299279,[A case of pontine infarction with persistent primitive proatlantal artery].,"Ikeda, M; Okamoto, K; Hirai, S; Amari, M; Takatama, M",Ikeda,"A 61-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital on September 18, 1991 because of left hemiparesis, dysphagia, and dysarthria since five days before. She was formerly pointed out diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but she did not receive any treatment. The MRI showed a high signal area in the right paramedian portion of the upper pons on T2 weighted image and proton image. The angiography showed that persistent primitive proatlantal artery originated from the left internal carotid artery and joined to the horizontal portion of the left vertebral artery. The image of carotid-vertebrobasilar system and proatlantal artery showed so severely arteriosclerotic. This is the first report of brainstem infarction with persistent primitive proatlantal artery. In this case, the pontine infarction was thought to occur on the basis of the arteriosclerosis of blood vessels and change of blood flow of carotid-vertebrobasilar system due to persistent primitive proatlantal artery.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
16260041,Prolonged dysphagia due to Listeria-rhombencephalitis with brainstem abscess and acute polyradiculoneuritis.,"Smiatacz, Tomasz; Kowalik, Maciej Michal; Hlebowicz, Maria",Smiatacz,"We report a case of previously healthy student with acute rhombencephalitis and brainstem abscess caused by Listeria monocytogenes. The disease begun with uncharacteristic prodromal symptoms of gastrointestinal infection followed by headache and vertigo. After hospital admission the patient rapidly deteriorated, presenting pronounced dysphagia and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was established upon clinical symptoms of infection, brainstem involvement, typical MRI findings and positive for L. monocytogenes blood culture. Infection was complicated by acute, demyelinating neuropathy, diagnosed upon clinical symptoms of frail palsy confirmed by ENG. Initially introduced empirical doxycyclin/ceftriaxon treatment was subsequently changed to targeted ampicillin/gentamycin therapy, mechanical ventilation, intravenous human immunoglobulin treatment, tracheostomy and endoscopic gastrostomy. Prolonged dysphagia resolved after rehabilitation. After one year the patient remains well with only slight dysmetria.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,The Journal of infection,10.1016/j.jinf.2005.08.034,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
18482757,Combined covered stent and onyx treatment for complex dural arteriovenous fistula involving the clivus and cavernous sinus.,"Shi, Zhong-Song; Qi, Tie-Wei; Gonzalez, Nestor R; Ziegler, Jordan; Huang, Zheng-Song",Shi,"Complex DAVFs involving both the clivus and cavernous sinus are rare, especially when associated with brainstem compression from a large varix. In this report, we describe the use of a covered stent in combination with a liquid embolic agent to cure a complex clival-cavernous DAVF. A 46-year-old man presented with 6 months of dizziness, dysphagia, and progressive dysarthria. Magnetic resonance imaging showed tortuous and enlarged right cavernous and preclival flow voids. There were also bilateral prepontine varices compressing the ventral pons, which led to marked dorsal pontine edema. A cerebral angiogram revealed a clival DAVF supplied by multiple branches of the right ECA, as well as the MHT of the right ICA. An endovascular cure was achieved by deploying a covered stent in the right cavernous ICA, followed by transarterial embolization of the feeding arteries originating from the ECA with Onyx (ev3, Irvine, Calif). This combined approach resulted in complete occlusion of the fistula. His 1-month follow-up angiogram confirmed persistent occlusion of the fistula and preserved patency of the right ICA. The patient made a full recovery without any new symptoms, and he remained neurologically intact at 18-month follow-up. The combined technique of covered stent placement and Onyx transarterial embolization is valuable for the management of complex DAVFs supplied by branches of both the external and internal carotid arteries.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2008.03.022,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
