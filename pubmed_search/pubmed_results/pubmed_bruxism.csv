33934685,Cannabidiol in the management of bruxism in behavioral variant of frontotemporal degeneration.,"Pina-Escudero, Stefanie Danielle; Okada de Oliveira, Maira; Snyder, Alisson; Miller, Bruce L",Pina-Escudero,"Awake bruxism is an understudied feature of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). We present the case of aman who presented with psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive changes, and teeth clenching that resulted in significant changes in his teeth alignment including an underbite. He received multiple treatments with partial response. He then started using acannabidiol (CBD) capsule, and the grinding was almost completely relieved after this intervention. There is still no standardized pharmacology treatment for bruxism in patients with bvFTD. As aconsequence, acase-by-case approach is suggested. CBD can be helpful as an adjunct therapeutic agent for awake bruxism.Not StartedCompletedRejected.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2021.1917620,,Bruxism; behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia; cannabidiol,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

25144179,Botulinum toxin injection for bruxism associated with brain injury: case report.,"Kesikburun, Serdar; Alaca, Rıdvan; Aras, Berke; Tuğcu, Ilknur; Tan, Arif Kenan",Kesikburun,"Bruxism is involuntary grinding of the teeth and can occur as a complication of brain injury. If untreated, bruxism can lead to severe occlusal trauma. Herein, we present a patient with traumatic brain injury and nocturnal bruxism that was treated with botulinum toxin injection. A 21 yr old male patient with traumatic brain injury from a car accident was admitted to our inpatient rehabilitation unit. He had a history of coma for 2 wk in the intensive care unit. The initial cranial computed tomography scan indicated a superior thalamic hemorrhage. On admission to our department 3 mo postinjury, his mental status was good and he was able to walk without assistance, but he had mild ataxia. He complained about severe teeth grinding at night, which began 2 mo postinjury. Botulinum toxin-A was injected into the masseter muscles (20 U in each muscle) and temporalis muscles (15 U in each muscle) bilaterally. A decrease in bruxism was reported within 3 d. Clinical improvement persisted at assessment 4 mo posttreatment. Botulinum toxin injection can be used as an effective treatment for bruxism associated with brain injury.",{},,Journal of rehabilitation research and development,10.1682/JRRD.2013.10.0218,,botulinum toxin; bruxism; bruxism treatment; case report; complication; masseter muscle; temporalis muscle; tooth clenching; tooth grinding; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
9365360,Bruxism after brain injury: successful treatment with botulinum toxin-A.,"Ivanhoe, C B; Lai, J M; Francisco, G E",Ivanhoe,"Bruxism, the rhythmic grinding of teeth--usually during sleep--is not an infrequent complication of traumatic brain injury. Its prevalence in the general population is 21%, but its incidence after brain injury is unknown. Untreated, bruxism causes masseter hypertrophy, headache, temporomandibular joint destruction, and total dental wear. We report a case of complete resolution of postanoxic bruxism after treatment with botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A). The patient was a 28-year-old man with no history of bruxism who sustained an anoxic brain injury secondary to cardiac arrest of unknown etiology. On admission to our rehabilitation unit 2 months after the injury, the patient presented with severe bruxism and heavy dental wear. The patient was injected with a total of 200 units of BTX-A to each masseter and temporalis. There was total resolution of bruxism 2 days after injection, with no complications. On follow-up 3 months after injection, the patient remained free of bruxism. We propose that botulinum toxin be considered as a treatment for bruxism secondary to anoxic brain injury. Further studies regarding muscle selection and medication dosage are warranted to elucidate the toxin's efficacy in this condition.",{},,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/s0003-9993(97)90343-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

26346787,Sleep bruxism possibly triggered by multiple sclerosis attacks and treated successfully with botulinum toxin: Report of three cases.,"Sevim, Serhan; Kaleağası, Hakan; Fidancı, Halit",Sevim,"Sleep bruxism refers to a nocturnal parafunctional activity including the clenching, grinding or gnashing of teeth. While most of the nocturnal bruxism cases seen in the general population are apparently idiopathic, it has been reported to be associated with a range of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease, cranio-cervical dystonia and post-anoxic brain damage, but not multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe three cases of MS patients who have had moderate to severe complaints of bruxism in the two weeks following their relevant MS attacks. None of the three patients had a diagnosis of bruxism prior to her attack. The diagnosis was confirmed in one out of three by a polysomnography. One patient did not have any complaints related to bruxism previous to her attack, whereas two had mild and infrequent complaints. The symptoms of the relevant attacks were left hemihypesthesia in all and hemiparesis in two. None of the patients had spasticity that could result in severe teeth clenching. All three patients presented with morning headaches and jaw pain or tightness and were treated successfully with botulinum toxin (Btx) injections applied to their masseter and temporalis muscles. The cause of bruxism is controversial but lesions of the cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cotrical loops are thought to be most likely. However, acute or chronic lesions in those pathways were not demonstrated in the 3 patients. It is feasible that they had normal appearing white matter interruptions in their cortico-basalganglia-thalamocortical loops along with their relevant attack.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2015.06.006,,Attack; Botulinum toxin; Bruxism; Multiple sclerosis; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
14706229,Severe bruxism following basal ganglia infarcts: insights into pathophysiology.,"Tan, Eng-King; Chan, Ling-Ling; Chang, Hui-Meng",Tan,"Bruxism characterized by clenching and grinding of teeth can lead to toothwear, headaches and depression. While bruxism has been associated with a number of neurological diseases, it has not been highlighted following cerebral infarction. An elderly man presented with an acute onset of tooth grinding and jaw clenching associated with dysarthria. His bruxism was worse during the day and resolved during sleep. He had frequent jaw aches, headaches and swallowing difficulty. Examination demonstrated the presence of dysarthria with jaw clenching and tooth grinding, producing persistent high pitch and loud squeaky sounds. A magnetic resonance imaging and angiography examination revealed a recent infarct in the right thalamus. In addition, chronic lacunar infarcts were present in the bilateral caudate nuclei with severe basilar artery stenosis. He was successfully treated with botulinum toxin. We discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms of bruxism associated with basal ganglia infarcts. Dysfunction of the efferent and/or afferent thalamic or striatopallidal tracts may play a role in bruxism. Early recognition of bruxism following stroke could reduce unnecessary suffering since the condition can be effectively treated.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2003.10.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
24165294,A relationship between bruxism and orofacial-dystonia? A trigeminal electrophysiological approach in a case report of pineal cavernoma.,"Frisardi, Gianni; Iani, Cesare; Sau, Gianfranco; Frisardi, Flavio; Leornadis, Carlo; Lumbau, Aurea; Enrico, Paolo; Sirca, Donatella; Staderini, Enrico Maria; Chessa, Giacomo",Frisardi,"In some clinical cases, bruxism may be correlated to central nervous system hyperexcitability, suggesting that bruxism may represent a subclinical form of dystonia. To examine this hypothesis, we performed an electrophysiological evaluation of the excitability of the trigeminal nervous system in a patient affected by pineal cavernoma with pain symptoms in the orofacial region and pronounced bruxism. Electrophysiological studies included bilateral electrical transcranial stimulation of the trigeminal roots, analysis of the jaw jerk reflex, recovery cycle of masseter inhibitory reflex, and a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. The neuromuscular responses of the left- and right-side bilateral trigeminal motor potentials showed a high degree of symmetry in latency (1.92 ms and 1.96 ms, respectively) and amplitude (11 mV and 11.4 mV, respectively), whereas the jaw jerk reflex amplitude of the right and left masseters was 5.1 mV and 8.9 mV, respectively. The test stimulus for the recovery cycle of masseter inhibitory reflex evoked both silent periods at an interstimulus interval of 150 ms. The duration of the second silent period evoked by the test stimulus was 61 ms and 54 ms on the right and left masseters, respectively, which was greater than that evoked by the conditioning stimulus (39 ms and 35 ms, respectively). We found evidence of activation and peripheral sensitization of the nociceptive fibers, the primary and secondary nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, and the endogenous pain control systems (including both the inhibitory and facilitatory processes), in the tested subject. These data suggest that bruxism and central orofacial pain can coexist, but are two independent symptoms, which may explain why numerous experimental and clinical studies fail to reach unequivocal conclusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,10.1186/1744-9081-9-41,PMC3874619,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
30796080,"Fulminant thymomatous AMPAR-antibody limbic encephalitis with hypertonic coma, bruxism, an isoelectric electroencephalogram and temporal cortical atrophy, with recovery.","Urriola, Nicolás; Soosapilla, Kavie; Drummond, James; Thieben, Mark",Urriola,"Autoimmune encephalitides are a potentially devastating group of treatable disorders with a wide variety of clinical presentations. The most studied autoimmune encephalitis is caused by antibodies to the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor. A rarer cause is due to antibodies against the evolutionarily related α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR). The full assortment of electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical descriptions of the latter are yet to be fully described. A 44-year-old woman with impaired consciousness and subsequent coma characterised by an isoelectric EEG was diagnosed with AMPAR-antibody limbic encephalitis. MRI revealed temporal T2 hyperintensities that improved with immunosuppression, although leaving marked cortical atrophy. Gradual clinical improvement saw the development of aggressive bruxism requiring botulinum toxin injection with eventual meaningful clinical recovery. This case expands the clinical spectrum of AMPAR limbic encephalitis to include aggressive bruxism, and highlights that despite poor clinical and EEG findings at the outset, recovery is still possible.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2018-227893,PMC6388879,botulinum toxin; immunology; neuroimaging,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
19566457,Encephalitis in a rabbit caused by human herpesvirus-1.,"Müller, Kerstin; Fuchs, Walter; Heblinski, Nikola; Teifke, Jens P; Brunnberg, Leo; Gruber, Achim D; Klopfleisch, Robert",Müller,"An 8-month-old sexually intact male rabbit was examined because of a 2-day history of anorexia, epiphora of the left eye, bruxism, hypersalivation, and ataxia. Physical examination of the rabbit revealed bilateral conjunctivitis, hypersalivation, and severe signs of CNS dysfunction such as incoordination, intermittent myoclonic seizures, and opisthotonus. Results of hematologic and serum biochemical analyses revealed only lymphopenia, a relative monocytosis, and an increase in serum activity of creatine phosphokinase and serum concentration of total protein. Serum antibodies against Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Toxoplasma gondii were not detected. Despite IV administration of crystalloid fluids and treatment with antimicrobials, vitamin B complex, nutritional support, and prednisolone, the condition of the rabbit deteriorated; it was euthanized 7 days after admission. Histologic evaluation of brain tissue revealed lesions characteristic of severe, diffuse, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis and a few large, eosinophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies in neurons and glial cells. The DNA of human herpesvirus-1 was detected in the nuclei of glial cells, lymphocytes, and neurons by means of in situ hybridization. The rabbit's owner, who reported having had a severe labial and facial herpesvirus infection 5 days before the onset of clinical signs in the rabbit, was suspected to be the origin of infection for the rabbit. Human herpesvirus-1 may be transmissible from humans to rabbits, and infection with this virus should be considered as a differential diagnosis in rabbits with CNS signs of disease.",{},,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,10.2460/javma.235.1.66,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
