25721796,Hyperacusis following unilateral damage to the insular cortex: a three-case report.,"Boucher, Olivier; Turgeon, Christine; Champoux, Sara; Ménard, Lucie; Rouleau, Isabelle; Lassonde, Maryse; Lepore, Franco; Nguyen, Dang K",Boucher,"The insula is a multisensory area involved in various brain functions, including central auditory processing. However, its specific role in auditory function remains unclear. Here we report three cases of persistent hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli following damage to the insular cortex, using behavioral and neurophysiological measures. Two patients who complained of auditory disturbance since they suffered an isolated unilateral insular stroke, and one epileptic patient who underwent right insular resection for control of drug-resistant seizures, were involved in this study. These patients, all young adult women, were tested for auditory function more than one year after brain injury, and were compared to 10 healthy control participants matched for age, sex, and education. The assessment included pure-tone detection and speech detection in quiet, loudness discomfort levels, random gap detection, recognition of frequency and duration patterns, binaural separation, dichotic listening, as well as late-latency auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Each patient showed mild or moderate hyperacusis, as revealed by decreased loudness discomfort levels, which was more important on the side of lesion in two cases. Tests of temporal processing also revealed impairments, in concordance with previous findings. ERPs of two patients were characterised by increased amplitude of the P3b component elicited during a two-tone auditory oddball detection task. This study is the first to report cases of persistent hyperacusis following damage to the insular cortex, and suggests that the insula is involved in modulating the perceived intensity of the incoming auditory stimuli during late-stage processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2015.02.030,,Auditory processing; Event-related potentials; Hyperacusis; Insula; Saliency; Stroke,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
20420335,Fluid dynamics vascular theory of brain and inner-ear function in traumatic brain injury: a translational hypothesis for diagnosis and treatment.,"Shulman, Abraham; Strashun, Arnold M",Shulman,"It is hypothesized that in all traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with a clinical history of closed or penetrating head injury, the initial head trauma is associated with a vibratory sensation and noise exposure, with resultant alteration in vascular supply to the structures and contents of the fluid compartments of brain and ear (i.e., the fluid dynamics vascular theory of brain-inner-ear function [FDVTBE]). The primary etiology-head trauma-results in an initial fluctuation, interference, or interaction in the normal fluid dynamics between brain and labyrinth of the inner ear, with a resultant clinical diversity of complaints varying in time of onset and severity. Normal function of the brain and ear is a reflection of a normal state of homeostasis between the fluid compartments in the brain of cerebrospinal fluid and perilymph-endolymph in the labyrinth of the ear. The normal homeostasis in the structures and contents between the two fluid compartment systems--intracerebral and intralabyrinthine--is controlled by mechanisms involved in the maintenance of normal pressures, water and electrolyte content, and neurotransmitter activities. The initial pathophysiology (a reflection of an alteration in the vascular supply to the brain-ear) is hypothesized to be an initial acute inflammatory response, persistence of which results in ischemia and an irreversible alteration in the involved neural substrates of brain-ear. Clinically, a chronic multisymptom complex becomes manifest. The multisymptom complex, individual for each TBI patient regardless of the diagnostic TBI category (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe), initially reflects processes of inflammation and ischemia which, in brain, result in brain volume loss identified as neurodegeneration and hydrocephalus ex vacuo or an alteration in cerebrospinal fluid production (i.e., pseudotumor cerebri) and, in ear, secondary endolymphatic hydrops with associated cochleovestibular complaints of hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, ear blockage, and hyperacusis. The FDVTBE integrates and translates a neurovascular hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease to TBI. This study presents an FDVTBE hypothesis of TBI to explain the clinical association of head trauma (TBI) and central nervous system neurodegeneration with multisensory complaints, highlighted by and focusing on cochleovestibular complaints. A clinical case report, previously published for demonstration of the cerebrovascular medical significance of a particular type of tinnitus, and evidence-based basic science and clinical medicine are cited to provide objective evidence in support and demonstration of the FDVTBE.",{},,The international tinnitus journal,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng
12474992,Central hyperacusis with phonophobia in multiple sclerosis.,"Weber, H; Pfadenhauer, K; Stöhr, M; Rösler, A",Weber,"Hearing disorders are a well-described symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Unilateral or bilateral hyperacusis or deafness in patients with normal sound audiometry is often attributed to demyelinating lesions in the central auditory pathway. Less known in MS is a central phonophobia, whereby acoustic stimuli provoke unpleasant and painful paresthesia and lead to the corresponding avoidance behaviour. In our comparison collective, patient 1 described acute shooting pain attacks in his right cheek each time set off by the ringing of the telephone. Patient 2 complained of intensified, unbearable noise sensations when hearing nonlanguage acoustic stimuli. Patient 3 noticed hearing unpleasant echoes and disorders of the directional hearing. All patients had a clinical brainstem syndrome. ENT inspection, sound audiometry and stapedius reflex were normal. All three patients had pathologically changed auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) with indications of a brainstem lesion, and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demyelinating lesions in the ipsilateral pons and in the central auditory pathway. The origin we presume in case 1 is an abnormal impulse conduction from the leminiscus lateralis to the central trigeminus pathway and, in the other cases, a disturbance in the central sensory modulation. All patients developed in the further course a clinically definite MS. Having excluded peripheral causes for a hyperacusis, such as, e.g., an idiopathic facial nerve palsy or myasthenia gravis, one should always consider the possibility of MS in a case of central phonophobia. Therapeutic possibilities include the giving of serotonin reuptake inhibitors or acoustic lenses for clearly definable disturbing frequencies.",{},,"Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",10.1191/1352458502ms814oa,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
33360763,Simultaneous auditory agnosia: Systematic description of a new type of auditory segregation deficit following a right hemisphere lesion.,"Holmes, Emma; Utoomprurkporn, Nattawan; Hoskote, Chandrashekar; Warren, Jason D; Bamiou, Doris-Eva; Griffiths, Timothy D",Holmes,"We investigated auditory processing in a young patient who experienced a single embolus causing an infarct in the right middle cerebral artery territory. This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task-a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation-demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.10.023,PMC7856551,Audition; Misophonia; Music; Segregation; Speech perception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
34632519,"Delayed-Onset Neuropathological Complications From a Foramen Magnum and Occipital Crest Focused Traumatic Brain Injury of the Vietnam War and Other Conflicts: Part I, Case Report.","Burkle, Frederick M; Hadley, Kevin S; Ridge, Leah L; Herman, Jan K; Kobeissy, Firas H",Burkle,"The diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries is typically based on hemispheric blasts resulting in degrees of unconsciousness and associated cerebral injuries. This case report describes a Vietnam War era setting in which a traumatic blast wave struck the posterior cranium in the region of the foramen magnum, occipital crest, and other skull openings (orbit, oronasal, and ear) and the unique secondary clinical signs and symptoms experienced over time. This case report describes secondary delayed-onset clinical signs and symptoms consistent with progressive decades-long physical and functional complications. The traumatic blast resulted in brief unconsciousness, decreased vision in left eye, confusion, right sided hemotympanum, deafness, severe tinnitus, severe nasopharynx pain and difficulty swallowing, pain in right posterior and occipital area of the head, and loss of dental amalgams. Subsequent exams revealed progressive hyperacusis, sea sickness, dysdiadochokinesis, diagnosis of 9th and 10th cranial nerve traumatic schwannomas, hyperdense changes to the frontal lobe white matter, progressive tinnitus, chronic vertigo, right-sided high-frequency hearing loss, progressive oculo-gyric crisis of Tumarkin-like seizures, left-sided chronic vitreous hemorrhage, and diminished right hemisphere performance of the brain based on neurophysiological assessment. No post-traumatic stress, depression, or other emotional or psychiatric difficulties were claimed.

Auditory symptoms associated with migrainous infarction have not previously been emphasized. To describe migrainous infarction presenting with acute auditory symptoms. Case reports. Tertiary care hospitals. A 40-year-old man with a history of migraine suddenly developed bilateral hearing loss associated with severe, throbbing, occipital headache, tinnitus, vertigo, speech disturbance, and right hemiparesis. An early audiogram showed profound, down-sloping, sensorineural-type hearing loss bilaterally. Sixteen days later, a follow-up pure tone audiogram documented marked improvement in both sides to a pure tone average of 30 dB. Right hemiparesis and dysarthria also improved steadily for 2 months. A 25-year-old woman with a history of migraine with aura suddenly developed hyperacusis, unilateral hearing loss, and migraine headache early in migrainous infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging documented infarcts in the pons and cerebellum. In these patients, acute auditory symptoms are a part of the prodrome of migrainous infarction. We speculate that these symptoms may have resulted from migraine-associated vasospasm. Migrainous infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute auditory symptoms, including sudden, bilateral hearing loss.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.60.1.113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

They are listed as a novel clinico-pathological entity in the 2007 World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of tumours of the central nervous system. This tumour corresponds to a WHO grade II neoplasm whereas pilocytic astrocytoma corresponds to WHO grade I. We have encountered an infratentorial tumour with pilomyxoid features in an adult. A 25 year old man presented with tinnitus and hyperacusis. Brain MRI revealed a mass occupying the fourth ventricle. We performed partial resection, but no adjuvant therapy was given. The staining index for the anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody MIB-1 was less than 1% in this patient. Pilomyxoid astrocytomas are not limited to the hypothalamic/chiasmatic region in children.

11789437,[Central hyperacusis with phonophobia in multiple sclerosis].,"Pfadenhauer, K; Weber, H; Rösler, A; Stöhr, M",Pfadenhauer,"Auditory disturbances are a well known symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Uni- or bilateral hypacusis or deafness in patients with normal auditory testing is considered to be a result of lesions in the central auditory pathway. Only rarely described is a central phonophobia whereby acoustic stimuli induce unpleasant and painful perceptions, with consecutive avoidance of these factors. Our first patient described acute shooting pain in the right cheek, triggered only through the ringing of a telephone. The second patient had uncomfortable perception of nonverbal noise. For example the wrinkling of paper bags was unbearable for him. The third patient had difficulties localizing the source of sound and disturbing echos while listening to speech or music. Clinically, in all patients symptoms of a brainstem syndrome were found, whereas auditory testing including inspection, audiometry, and stapedius reflex was normal. We found pathological acoustic evoked potentials (AEP) in all three patients with a prolonged latency III-V and T2 lesions in the ipsilateral pons and central auditory pathway. In case one, we suppose a lateral spread between the lateral lemniscus and the central trigeminal pathway. In the other cases, a dysfunction of the central sensory modulation which controls the regulation of sensitivity of incoming acoustic stimuli seems to be the cause of hyperacusis. All our patients developed clinically confirmed MS in the further course after suffering from phonophobia as their first symptom.",{},,Der Nervenarzt,10.1007/s001150170005,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,ger
8738639,Auditory deficits and hearing loss associated with focal brainstem haemorrhage.,"Cohen, M; Luxon, L; Rudge, P",Cohen,"Four cases of central pontine haemorrhage are described in which auditory dysfunction was documented. Two cases had a hearing loss, in one of which there was recovery of the low frequencies. This case provides support for the tonotopic organization of the auditory pathways in the caudal pontine area, with the lowest frequencies being encoded medially. In all cases, there were abnormalities of the auditory brainstem responses, wave V being consistently involved, while wave III was abnormal in only one patient. In three cases, the masking level differences and crossed acoustic reflex thresholds were abnormal. The ipsilateral reflex thresholds were normal at least on one side in all cases. In the patient with the most significant hearing loss, loudness recruitment, assessed both psychophysically and with the acoustic reflex thresholds, was evident. These data are interpreted in terms of there being damage to the medial superior olivary nuclei and trapezoid body involving both afferent and efferent fibres.",{},,Scandinavian audiology,10.3109/01050399609047995,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Denmark,eng

The accident was a frontal collision in 1 case, a rear impact in the second, and lateral in the third. All patients complained immediately of cervicalgia, headache, acute vertigo with a sensation of erroneous body movements, and slipping of image with head movements. A sudden sensation of tilting of the environment when driving, tinnitus, and hyperacusis were also described. The otoneurologic findings showed bilateral canalolithiasis in 1 patient and an acute peripheral vestibular deficit in 2 patients. Tilt of the subjective visual vertical was measured in all patients. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging yielded normal findings. As angular and linear accelerometers, the vestibular organs are directly exposed to high forces generated by whiplash mechanisms. Vertigo generated by peripheral vestibular lesions is probably underestimated in whiplash injuries and may often be incorrectly attributed to cervical or cerebral lesions.",{},,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",10.1177/000348940311200310,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
