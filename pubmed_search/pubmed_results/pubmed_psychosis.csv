This was a prospective observational study of patients with FEP assessed for neuropsychiatric symptoms, serum and CSF neuronal antibodies (brain immunohistochemistry, cell-based assays, live neurons), and warning signs and criteria of AP. Previous autoimmune FEP series were reviewed. One hundred five patients were included; their median age was 30 (range 14-75) years, and 44 (42%) were female. None had neuronal antibodies. Two of 105 (2%) had CSF pleocytosis, 4 of 100 (4%) had brain MRI abnormalities, and 3 of 73 (4%) EEG alterations. Thirty-four (32%) and 39 (37%) patients fulfilled 2 sets of warning signs of AP, and 21 (20%) fulfilled criteria of possible or probable AP, yet none developed AP. The cause of FEP was psychiatric in 101 (96%) and nonpsychiatric in 4 (4%). During this study, 3 patients with psychosis caused by anti-NMDAR encephalitis were transferred to our center; 2 did not meet criteria for possible AP. Of 1,159 reported patients with FEP, only 7 (1%) had CSF studies; 36 (3%) had serum NMDAR antibodies (without definite diagnosis of AP), and 4 had CSF NMDAR antibodies (3 classic anti-NMDAR encephalitis and 1 with isolated psychiatric features). NMDAR antibodies were not found in patients with FEP unless they had anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Warning signs and criteria for AP have limited utility when neurologic symptoms are absent or paraclinical tests are normal. A diagnostic algorithm for autoimmune FEP is provided.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000012191,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

After reviewing the literature and comparing our clinical experience, we believe that palinacousis can occur as an aura, a simple partial seizure, a complex partial seizure, and/or a postictal event. Palinacousis maybe more common than recognized in patients with receptive aphasias or diffuse cerebral dysfunction, whose language deficits preclude adequate description. We report the case of a 71 years old man with the previously diagnosis of an infarction of left middle cerebral artery and valvular heart disease who presented with the symptoms of palinacousis. He was not diagnosed psychotic diseases. An electroencephalography showed normal wave. He was diagnosed as temporal lobe epilepsy with palinacousis due to post-stroke. Palinacousis was completely reversed after treatment with antiepileptic drug.

35145781,Hypocalcemia-Induced Reversible Psychosis.,"Hall, Andrea; Bin Farooq, Talha; Alcaraz, Renato",Hall,"Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.20874,PMC8805771,delusions; hypoparathyroidism; metabolic psychosis; reversible; s: hypocalcemia,Case Reports,United States,eng
36151446,Poststroke psychosis: a case report.,"Mota Freitas, Rodrigo; Reis Gomes, Diogo; Antunes Pedro, João; Guerra, Ana",Mota Freitas,"Stroke is currently the second leading cause of death in the elderly population. Neuropsychiatric complications following stroke are common, can be overlooked, and are associated with low quality of life, increase in the burden of caregiving and impaired functional status. We report a case of poststroke psychosis in a woman without prior psychiatric history. In addition, a brief, nonsystematic review of the pertinent literature was performed. Psychosis can present in almost 5% of stroke survivors. Many patients with poststroke psychosis have no previous psychiatric history and the most common lesion locations include the right frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, the white matter connecting those areas, as well as the right caudate nucleus. Compared to other stroke survivors, patients with poststroke psychosis are more likely to depend on assistance in their everyday lives, can have more difficulty coping with the sequelae of stroke, and have an increased 10-year mortality risk. Guidelines for diagnosing and managing poststroke psychosis are needed. Psychosis is a possible complication of stroke and is associated with impairment and increased mortality. Guidelines for diagnosing and managing poststroke psychosis are currently lacking.

The contribution of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is mainly unclear in this context. Therefore, two patients with psychosis and anti-MOG antibodies - detected in fixed cell-based and live cell-based assays - are presented. Patient 1 suffered from late-onset psychosis with singular white matter lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intermittent electroencephalography (EEG) slowing. Patient 2 suffered from a chronic paranoid-hallucinatory disorder with intermittent confusional states, non-specific white matter alterations on MRI, a disorganised alpha rhythm on EEG, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein. Both patients had anti-MOG antibody titres of 1 : 320 in serum (reference < 1 : 20). The arguments for and against a causal role for anti-MOG antibodies are discussed.

Although cognitive impairment is one of the major symptoms of ventricular tumors, few studies have reported the details of cognitive impairment before and after their surgical removal. The expected effects on cognitive function should also be considered when choosing a surgical approach. We report the case of a large lateral ventricle meningioma revealed by cognitive dysfunction and moderate intellectual disability. The patient underwent subtotal resection of the tumor which had partial improvement in cognitive disorders. It is important to precisely assess neuropsychological function in patients with large brain tumors, and judicious preoperative plan, adequate knowledge of anatomy, and use of correct microsurgical techniques are fundamental in achieving complete resection of paraventricular meningioma with low morbidity.

This medical condition's effects range from altered mental status to an irreversible comatose state, and in severe cases even death. TBI affects millions of individuals worldwide on an annual basis. In the United States, approximately 2.87 million TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits were reported in 2014, and nearly 43% of these cases will experience long-term disabilities. These disabilities have both short- and long-term consequences on health, ranging from physical, emotional, and psychosocial changes in an individual. The goal of this case report is to highlight the morbidity of patients with TBI, with a key focus on TBI-induced secondary psychosis. While many patients recover from their symptoms of TBI within weeks to months, a subdivision of patients with TBI has permanent damage that will significantly affect the quality of their daily lives. TBI-induced secondary psychosis is the new onset of psychosis that can comprise visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thoughts. In this case report, the patient is a 22-year-old African American male who suffered a TBI at the age of 16. Prior to the patient's TBI sustained in 2016, the patient did not have a hospital record of past psychiatric illness. In addition, the patient's family history did not show evidence of schizophrenia, bipolar, or depression in close or distant relatives.

27789118,Adverse Structural and Functional Effects of Marijuana on the Brain: Evidence Reviewed.,"Mandelbaum, David E; de la Monte, Suzanne M",Mandelbaum,"The growing use and legalization of cannabis are leading to increased exposures across all age groups, including in adolescence. The touting of its medicinal values stems from anecdotal reports related to treatment of a broad range of illnesses including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscle spasms, arthritis, obesity, cancer, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, post-traumatic stress, inflammatory bowel disease, and anxiety. However, anecdotal data and the high level of interest in this treatment must not obscure objective assessments of any potential and realized short- and long-term adverse effects of cannabis, particularly with respect to age of onset and chronicity of exposure. This critical review focuses on evidence-based research designed to assess both therapeutic benefits and harmful effects of cannabis exposure and is combined with an illustration of the neuropathologic findings in a fatal case of cannabis-induced psychosis. The literature and reported case provide strong evidence that chronic cannabis abuse causes cognitive impairment and damages the brain, particularly white matter, where cannabinoid 1 receptors abound. Contrary to popular perception, there are few objective data supporting preferential use of cannabis over conventional therapy for restoration of central nervous system structure and function in disease states such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or schizophrenia.

The frequency with which milder forms of anti-LGI1 encephalitis mimic isolated psychiatric syndromes, such as psychoses, or may lead to dementia if untreated, is largely unknown. Here, the authors present a 50-year-old patient who had suffered from neurocognitive deficits and predominant delusions for over one and a half years. He reported a pronounced feeling of thirst, although he was drinking 10-20 liters of water each day, and he was absolutely convinced that he would die of thirst. Due to insomnia in the last five years, the patient took Z-drugs; later, he also abused alcohol. Two years prior to admission, he developed a status epilepticus which had been interpreted as a withdrawal seizure. In his serum, anti-LGI1 antibodies were repeatedly detected by different independent laboratories. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses revealed slightly increased white blood cell counts and evidence for blood-brain-barrier dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintensities mesio-temporally and in the right amygdala. In addition, there was a slight grey-white matter blurring. A cerebral [<sup>18</sup>F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) examination of his brain showed moderate hypometabolism of the bilateral rostral mesial to medial frontal cortices. Treatment attempts with various psychotropic drugs remained unsuccessful in terms of symptom relief. After the diagnosis of probable chronified anti-LGI1 encephalitis was made, two glucocorticoid pulse treatments were performed, which led to a slight improvement of mood and neurocognitive deficits. Further therapy was not desired by the patient and his legally authorized parents. This case study describes a patient with anti-LGI1 encephalitis in the chronified stage and a predominant long-lasting psychiatric course with atypical symptoms of psychosis and typical neurocognitive deficits. The patient's poor response to anti-inflammatory drugs was probably due to the delayed start of treatment. This delay in diagnosis and treatment may also have led to the FDG-PET findings, which were compatible with frontotemporal dementia (""state of damage""). In similar future cases, newly occurring epileptic seizures associated with psychiatric symptoms should trigger investigations for possible autoimmune encephalitis, even in patients with addiction or other pre-existing psychiatric conditions. This should in turn result in rapid organic clarification and-in positive cases-to anti-inflammatory treatment. Early treatment of anti-LGI1 encephalitis during the ""inflammatory activity state"" is crucial for overall prognosis and may avoid the development of dementia in some cases. Based on this case, the authors advocate the concept-long established in many chronic inflammatory diseases in rheumatology-of distinguishing between an ""acute inflammatory state"" and a ""state of organ damage"" in autoimmune psychosis resembling neurodegenerative mechanisms.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci10060375,PMC7348933,anti-LGI1 encephalitis; autoimmune psychosis; limbic encephalitis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

34980994,Anatomical Association Between Schizophrenia and Cerebellum.,"Yeruva, Rajashekar Reddy; Shang, Yafei; Schoenbachler, Ben; Nuss, Sharon; El-Mallakh, Rif S",Yeruva,"The pathogenesis of schizophrenia is rarely attributed to dysfunction of the cerebellum. However, coordination of mental processes might involve the cerebellum and a cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit (CCTCC) that can mediate that process has been proposed. We present the case of a 31-year-old male patient with a family history of psychosis who developed schizophrenia in association with a slow-growing glioblastoma at the left posterior cerebellar pontine angle. Of interest is that his psychosis became refractory after surgical removal of the tumor that had no motor deficit consequences, suggesting that the greater disruption of the CCTCC due to surgical excision might be related to the worsening psychosis.

The CNS may be involved at any stage of infection. A 54-year-old previously healthy African American male was hospitalized due to a two-year history of progressive cognitive decline. One year after symptoms began, he developed, over a four-month period, gait disturbance resulting in frequent falls, speech impairment, worsening memory loss, psychosis, and an inability to perform activities of daily living. A diagnosis of neurosyphilis was established upon cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positive results and new changes in his mental status. The CSF showed predominant lymphocytic pleocytosis (17), elevated protein (111), and IgG index (4.25). Other viral and bacterial panels were negative. Intravenous penicillin G, 24 million units daily for 14 days, was given. Two months later, the patient was transferred to the hospital for altered behavior and mental status changes from the cognitive baseline. The repeat CSF rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer (1:4) was the same as at initial diagnosis, despite appropriate treatment. Brain MRI showed progressive volume loss in both temporal lobes, thalamus, and cerebellum, consistent with evolving encephalitis. Treatment with intravenous penicillin G, 24 million units, was repeated. The patient improved clinically. Hence, in emerging cases of syphilis, this patient has been diagnosed with a neurosyphilis flare, unresponsive to the usual dose and duration of penicillin. We recommended a repeat CSF examination every six months and having a lower threshold for CSF examination for possible flare or resistance. Our case showed a failure to respond to the usual course of penicillin, requiring a second course of IV Penicillin G, although no resistance to penicillin has been reported.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.21456,PMC8857962,csf rpr; encephalitis; fta-abs; neurosyphilis; penicillin failure; penicillin resistance; reversible dementia; treponema pallidum,Case Reports,United States,eng

He presented with auditory hallucinations, agitation, and bizarre and disorganized behavior. He was treated with antipsychotic medications without improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hyperintensities throughout the brain parenchyma. Investigations for infectious, metabolic, autoimmune, and malignant etiologies were negative. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis was suspected. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum NMDA receptor antibody testing were performed. Both tests were positive, confirming anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, which resulted in the resolution of his psychosis. In the case of unexplained psychosis associated with seizures, early screening using serum and CSF testing for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies and brain magnetic resonance imaging may be an important diagnostic tool for detecting anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Detailed investigations of CSF and serum should be performed to rule out infectious, metabolic, and autoimmune causes. Imaging studies should also be performed to identify any tumors such as a teratoma. This approach may help identify patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis masquerading as psychosis. Early diagnosis and treatment including intravenous steroids, immunosuppressants, plasmapheresis, and removal of any teratoma if present in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis can improve the overall outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of psychiatric practice,10.1097/PRA.0000000000000603,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

These symptoms only disappeared with therapeutic dosages of an antipsychotic drug (3 mg/day of risperidone). At 2-year follow-up, he no longer had delusional activity and the antipsychotic treatment was gradually discontinued over the following year. However, 1 week after full cessation, the patient once more became agitated and suspicious and was put back on risperidone at 0.25 mg/day, resulting in rapid clinical remission. One year after the return to low-dose risperidone, the patient's psychopathology is still under control and he is free from psychotic symptoms. Psychosis is a relatively rare complication after stroke. To our knowledge, no cases of post-stroke psychosis that apparently require continuous low-dose antipsychotic treatment have been reported to date.

In the present study we report the case of a 59 year-old woman, who was admitted to our department after a suicide attempt, and who showed symptoms of Cotard's syndrome for about two years, namely depressed mood, hypochondriac and nihilistic delusions, delusions of immortality and damnation, suicidal ideation, severe psychomotor retardation, diminished motivation and tendency to stay in bed. She never took the medication she was prescribed, and at times she refused to eat. During her hospitalization, there was performed a full blood panel and medical imaging, that showed chronic ischemic infarctions, periventricular leukoencephalopathy and diffuse cerebral atrophy in MRI. All the other test results were normal. She was administered treatment with haloperidol, mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Gradually, her psychomotor ability, motivation and mood improved, she didn't express suicidal ideation, her delusions were less intense and she was able to question them, but they weren't eliminated. She was discharged in improved condition, after 44 days. Cotard's syndrome isn't mentioned in the current classification systems (ICD-10, DSM-5). In literature though, it has been divided into three types, according to the clinical symptoms: psychotic depression, Cotard type I, and Cotard type II, and three stages have been proposed: germination stage, blooming stage and chronic stage. It has been associated with various medical conditions, such as cerebral infractions, frontotemporal atrophy, epilepsy, encephalitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, it has been associated with psychiatric conditions, such as mental retardation, postpartum depression, depersonalization disorder, catatonia, Capgras syndrome, Fregoli syndrome, Odysseus syndrome, koro syndrome. Several reports about successful pharmacological treatments have been published, both monotherapies with antidepressants, antipsychotics or lithium, and by antidepressant and antipsychotic combination treatments. The most reported successful treatment strategy for Cotard's syndrome is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), administration of which should follow current treatment guidelines of the underlying conditions.",{},,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,10.22365/jpsych.2016.274.296,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Greece,gre

A 47-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services for altered mental status. He was given naloxone without improvement in mental status. His glucose was 110 mg/dL. Upon presentation to the ED, he was hyperthermic (106.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and tachycardic (heart rate of 160's beats/minute). Home medications included risperidone and fluphenazine. After the resolution of his hyperthermia, he had a right-sided facial droop concerning a cerebrovascular accident. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain confirmed an early/acute subacute right cerebellar infarction. The patient received optimal treatment; his mental status returned to baseline, and he was discharged home without antipsychotic medications. Patients who are prescribed antipsychotics should be aware of the potentially fatal adverse events that can occur from these medications. Thermoregulation may be impaired in these patients, resulting in significant hyperthermia, in which case antipsychotic medications should be discontinued.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.18651,PMC8509109,antipsychotic; cerebrovascular accident; heat stroke; hyperthermia; schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,Case Reports,United States,eng

Very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) is a nosological entity that remains a conundrum. We provide a comprehensive literature review on the neurobiological underpinnings of VLOSLP. We describe a case that typifies the clinical presentation of VLOSLP. Although not pathognomonic, certain features, namely the two-stage progression of psychotic episode, partition delusions, multimodal hallucinations, and absent formal thought disorder or negative symptoms, are quite suggestive of VLOSLP. Several medical causes that might cause late-life psychosis, including neuroinflammatory/immunology diseases, were ruled out. Neuroimaging revealed basal ganglia lacunar infarctions along with chronic white matter small-vessel ischemic disease. The diagnosis of VLOSLP is based on clinical evidence, and the aforementioned clinical features support this diagnostic hypothesis. This case adds to the growing body of evidence pertaining to the relevance of cerebrovascular risk factors in the pathophysiology of VLOSLP, alongside age-specific neurobiological processes. We hypothesized that microvascular brain lesions disrupt the frontal-subcortical circuitry and uncover other core neuropathological processes. Future research should focus on identifying a specific biomarker that would allow clinicians to more accurately diagnose VLOSLP, differentiate it from other overlapping clinical entities such as dementia or post-stroke psychosis, and provide a tailored treatment for the patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of geriatric medicine and research,10.4235/agmr.23.0026,PMC10326410,Formed of people hallucinations; Gustatory hallucinations; Schizophrenia; Somatic hallucinations,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

Post-stroke psychosis (PSPsy) is a particularly neglected sequel despite its disruptive nature. To present a case of early emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms following a left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. To review and discuss PSPsy clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and clinical outcomes. A previously autonomous 68-year-old woman with vascular risk factors and depressive disorder presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of disorientation, motor aphasia, and right hypoesthesia. Computer tomography revealed a left PCA stroke. She was started on acetylsalicylic acid and rosuvastatin and discharged the next day. Afterward, the patient developed a depressive mood, emotional lability, periods of confusion, delusions of persecution, guilt and unworthiness, auditory hallucinations, and suicide ideation. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and started on risperidone with a good response, being discharged after 15 days with the resolution of psychiatric symptoms. PSPsy is more common after right hemisphere lesions and usually develops after some months. Nevertheless, our patient presented PSPsy following an ischemic event of the left PCA, with neuropsychiatric symptomatology dominating the clinic since the beginning. The involvement of the retrosplenial cortex or its connections was likely important for this atypical presentation. Due to the lack of guidelines on approaching PSPsy, most patients are treated with the same strategies used for non-stroke patients. A better comprehension of the anatomical basis underlining the symptomatology in these patients could deepen the understanding of psychosis and psychotic disorders.",{},,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,,PMC10926015,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng

Schizophrenia is associated with early mortality, with 40% of this excess mortality due to suicide. This is a case of patient with schizophrenia who was treated with quetiapine after suffering a traumatic brain injury and recovered enough to be discharged to a rehabilitation unit. This case illustrates the neuroprotective effects of quetiapine in treating neurologic deficits in a patient who recently suffered a traumatic brain injury. This is a case report of a patient with schizophrenia treated in the hospital setting. He was placed on quetiapine after suffering a traumatic brain injury due to a suicide attempt in which he shot himself with a nail gun. The patient initially presented with neurologic deficits suggestive of traumatic brain injury (inattention, memory loss, muscle weakness) and psychosis from schizophrenia. He was treated with quetiapine and recovered enough to be discharged to a rehabilitation unit. Quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, has been shown to significantly decrease blood–brain barrier hyperpermeability by preserving tight junction integrity in small animal models. This anti-inflammatory effect may also help to preserve neurogenesis in patients with traumatic brain injury, as shown in this case. This case may help elucidate the nature of quetiapine’s neuroprotective effects in patients who have suffered traumatic brain injury and also highlights the need to further investigate other atypical antipsychotics and their potential neuroprotective role in treating traumatic brain injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,International journal of psychiatry in medicine,10.1177/0091217419838105,,TBI; neurogenesis; neuroprotective; quetiapine; schizophrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

26849855,Psychosis following traumatic brain injury and cannabis use in late adolescence.,"Rabner, Jonathan; Gottlieb, Sarah; Lazdowsky, Lori; LeBel, Alyssa",Rabner,"Both cannabis and traumatic brain injury (TBI) pose risks on the developing brain, including a potential increased vulnerability for developing psychosis. Recent reports detail an upward trend in both adolescent cannabis use and the concentration of THC, the most potent psychoactive component in cannabis. Similarly, it is estimated that 1.7 million Americans incur a TBI each year. Previously trivialized as a minor nuisance, attitudes towards TBIs are changing as researchers and the public recognize TBIs' possible long-lasting sequelae. Two cases are presented of adolescent patients with histories of TBI and self-reported heavy, recreational cannabis use who developed symptoms of psychosis. Similar neuronal signaling pathways involved in cannabis ingestion and TBI recovery, specifically CB1 receptors of the endocannabinoid system, as well as the allostatic load model provide context for the two presented cases. Given the cases and theories presented, we believe that cannabis use may act as a neurological stressor and risk factor for psychosis outweighing its possible benefits as a therapeutic solution for pain in late adolescent and young adult populations. The presented cases provide further support for the compounded risk of developing psychosis following TBI and cannabis use.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The American journal on addictions,10.1111/ajad.12338,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Furthermore, the brainstem's role in cognition and affect has been historically overlooked. Neuroimaging studies and an increasing number of case reports indicate cognitive deficits and hallucinatory phenomena after isolated brainstem lesions. We report a 56-year-old man who developed persistent persecutory delusions, hallucinations, cognitive impairment and flattened affect following an extensive bilateral cerebellar stroke with involvement of the midbrain. This is one of the few reported cases of unremitting psychosis secondary to cerebellar and mesencephalic vascular infarction. We suggest, based on the distribution of the patient's lesions, that his corresponding symptoms are a result of a disruption to cerebrocerebellar pathways.

The implications to treating physicians are discussed given the rareness of the two to be found together in the given age group. Following physical examination and several physical tests including both CT and MRI scans, it was established that in addition to psychosis, the young man had an unruptured intracranial aneurysm on the right anterior communication artery. The psychosis continued despite successful treatment of the aneurysm. It was concluded that the aneurysm was an incidental finding. UICs under the age of 30 in patients presenting with FEP are more likely to be coincidental findings rather than the underlying cause of psychosis.

In patients with a tumoural aetiology, the syndrome is typically characterised by a short symptom-free postoperative period followed by mutism of variable duration and behavioural and affective changes. More than 200 paediatric cases have been described but reports of adult patients are extremely rare. This paper discusses PFS in adults on the basis of a comprehensive literature survey and describes the pre- and postoperative findings in a new adult patient. In the preoperative phase, cognitive, behavioural and affective abnormalities were identified, matching a diagnosis of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998; Schmahmann, 2004). The immediate postoperative course was characterised by prefrontal-like behavioural and affective abnormalities, peduncular hallucinations and confusion evolving to psychosis. Akinetic mutism subsequently developed, lasted for 12 days and then alternated with episodes of diminished responsiveness in which pathological laughing and crying (PLC) occurred. Akinetic mutism resolved after treatment with a non-ergoline dopamine-agonist but CCAS persisted during longitudinal follow-up. From a semiological point of view ""relapsing-remitting akinetic mutism"" and PLC in our patient might add relevant information to current insights in the clinical expression of the PFS. As evidenced by a close parallelism between single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and clinical findings, CCAS as well as PFS seem to reflect functional disruption of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in cognitive, behavioural and affective functions. These findings may indicate that both syndromes share overt semiological resemblances and a common pathophysiological substrate. Consequently, CCAS and PFS may both be regarded as cerebellar-induced clinical conditions showing different aspects of a spectrum that range in degree of severity and symptom duration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2011.06.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Italy,eng

This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS.

Clinically, it can have an acute to sub-acute onset of confusion and cognitive impairment, facial-brachial dystonic seizures (FDBS), and psychiatric disturbances. The clinical manifestations are varied, and its diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to avoid delay in the treatment. When patients manifest mostly psychiatric symptoms, the disease may not be immediately recognized. We aim to report a case of Anti-LGI 1 LE in which the patient presented acute psychotic symptoms and was initially diagnosed with unspecified psychosis. We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids and immunoglobulin and later with IV rituximab. In patients that predominantly present with psychotic and cognitive disorders the diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE can be delayed predisposing them to a poorer prognosis (permanent cognitive impairment - especially short-term memory loss - and persistent seizures).

On the fourth day of admission, he developed severe anxiety and restlessness, exhibited thoughts of death, and reported experiencing vivid hallucinations upon closing his eyes. MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion in the corpus callosum. A lumbar puncture showed no increase in cell count or protein. The patient showed a positive response to treatment with antibiotics and olanzapine, demonstrating rapid symptomatic improvement. A follow-up MRI on the 11th day showed complete resolution of the brain lesions. Six months later, no neurological or psychiatric sequelae were noted.

Primary delusional parasitosis is a psychiatric disorder with the delusion as an isolated manifestation, whereas secondary delusional parasitosis is a delusion occurring secondary to a psychiatric disorder, substance use, or medical illness. A 62-year-old woman with no psychiatric history presented to the Emergency Department with two to three months of ""whole body itching"" and seeing small insects crawling on her skin and in her hair. Exam of her skin and scalp was notable for no appreciable lesions, rashes, excoriations, or insects. Her neurologic exam was notable for full visual fields, and no localizing deficits. A non-contrast head CT demonstrated a nonspecific heterogeneous low-attenuation lesion within the medial right occipital lobe, and a follow up MRI confirmed a right posterior cerebral artery distribution subacute infarction. She was admitted for two days, and ultimately was discharged on aspirin and atorvastatin for secondary prevention.

Studies have shown that there are a multitude of underlying issues, including mental illness, that elevate an individual's risk of dying by suicide ( CDC WONDER: Underlying cause of death, 1999-2019 . Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2020). Presented here is a case of Bing Neel syndrome (BNS) found in a 69-year-old man who died by suicide by jumping off a 135' bridge. His medical history was significant for traumatic brain injury, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. Bing Neel syndrome is a rare central nervous system complication of WM. His wife reported an abrupt mental deterioration starting 5 years before his death, characterized by paranoia, depression, and insomnia. He had been a high-functioning university professor. His decline culminated with the loss of independence in his activities of daily living. At autopsy, it was found that he experienced blunt force injuries related to the fall, causing his death. A neuropathologic examination revealed a brisk and fulminant clonal CD20 + /immunoglobulin M+ lymphocytic infiltrate, involving all sampled regions of his brain, consistent with WM. This workup was critical to obtaining an accurate pathologic diagnosis of BNS and understanding his full clinical status before death. Although BNS was not the proximate cause of death, this diagnosis aided the death investigation as a causal factor in his suicidality and was vital to providing his family closure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,10.1097/PAF.0000000000000824,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

MRI of this patient revealed signal abnormalities in the thalamus, the cerebellum, the brainstem and the corpus callosum with microbleeds and vascularization disorders. The second patient is a 41-year-old woman admitted for right hemiparesis and facial paralysis. Physical examination found a hypertension and the atypical imaging features on MRI were low ADC values with a pearl necklace appearance on ARM sequences. The third patient is a 32-year-old woman who undergone a surgery for an ectopic pregnancy and went in a coma for 8 days. Physical and biological parameters were normal. Diagnosis was delayed because of atypical signal abnormalities in caudal and lentiform nuclei that worsened on follow-up MRI, resulting in a dramatic evolution to bilateral cecity and psychosis. The last case is a 34-year-old woman with terminal renal failure hospitalized for spontaneously resolving tonic-clonic seizures. Biology showed high uremia and brain MRI revealed a gyriform enhancement at gadolinium injection with unilateral putamen lesion. The patient improved after blood purification.

T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated periventricular and white matter multiple sclerotic plugs with lesions. Eventually, MS was diagnosed after the appearance of paresthesia, upper and lower limb muscle weakness, ataxia, and urinary incontinency as typical signs. Then, the medications were changed to methylprednisolone and interferon therapy, which resulted in improvements in the clinical conditions of the patient. Based on the fact that organic disorders such as MS may sometimes appear with initial pure psychiatric symptoms without any neurological signs and symptoms, examinations for symptoms linked to CNS dysfunction, cognitive changes, atypical symptoms, detailed neurological examination, and limited response to conventional antipsychotic drugs are highly recommended to be carried out for patients with first-episode psychosis and even in the followup period.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,International medical case reports journal,10.2147/IMCRJ.S157287,PMC5896665,MS; case report; episode; multiple sclerosis; psychotic disorders; signs; symptoms,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

After experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure in the emergency department, she developed a fluent aphasia. Aphasias are ordinarily attributed to structural changes in the brain parenchyma, often from stroke, neoplasm, or infection. When the magnetic resonance imaging of brain failed to show changes that could explain her fluent aphasia, the neurology team consulted psychiatry to workup psychogenic aphasia. During an admission 9 months earlier, she had been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis and possible WE. There was a high degree of suspicion for recurrent HSV infection, intermittent focal seizure activity, postictal psychosis, pseudobulbar affect, or a vascular cause of her fluent aphasia. After 3 days of treatment with levetiracetam, high-dose intravenous thiamine, and aripiprazole, the patient's fluent aphasia reversed. The authors conclude that the patient's reversible fluent aphasia was not psychiatric in etiology but likely caused by her seizures, the result of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels; her electroencephalogram showed focal seizure activity in the temporal lobes, possibly affecting her language centers. Language-related neurological conditions, or aphasias, can mimic psychiatric conditions such as conversion disorder or psychosis. In patients with substance use disorders, the line between psychiatric and neurological conditions becomes even more difficult to distinguish. The paper also discusses how unique aspects of her medications - levetiracetam conferring neuron membrane fluidity; aripiprazole, a drug shown to halt brain atrophy in mouse models; and parenteral thiamine to address her deficiency and WE - have aided in the reversal of the fluent aphasia. Levetiracetam should be considered in WE and the rare occurrence of aphasia after seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S174481,PMC6183589,Wernicke’s encephalopathy; alcohol withdrawal; aphasia; levetiracetam; seizure; thiamine,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

Recent studies have highlighted the possibility that a subset of patients with first-onset severe psychiatric episodes might suffer from undiagnosed autoimmune encephalitis. Therefore, the authors performed a three-step immunohistochemistry-based screening for CNS autoantibodies in a large cohort of patients with postpartum psychosis and matched postpartum comparison subjects. Ninety-six consecutive patients with postpartum psychosis and 64 healthy postpartum women were included. Screening for antibodies in patient serum was performed using immunohistochemistry. Samples showing any staining were further examined by immunocytochemistry using live hippocampal neurons and cell-based assays to test for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies. Cell-based assays for all other known CNS antigens were performed in those samples with immunocytochemistry labeling but negative for NMDA receptor antibodies. Four patients (4%) with neuropil labeling suggestive for extracellular antigen reactivity were identified. Serum samples from all four patients showed clear extracellular labeling of live hippocampal neurons. Two women had the specific staining pattern characteristic for anti-NMDA receptor antibody positivity, which was confirmed by cell-based assays. Neither patient with anti-NMDA receptor antibody positivity had evidence of an ovarian teratoma. The other two patients tested negative by cell-based assays for all known CNS antigens. None of the matched postpartum comparison subjects had confirmed neuronal surface antibodies. The two patients with anti-NMDA receptor antibodies both showed extrapyramidal symptoms following initiation of treatment with low-dose haloperidol. In patients with acute psychosis during the postpartum period, systematic screening for anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies should be considered.

Diagnostic workup revealed anti-amphiphysin associated LE without a tumor. MRI and PET indicated inflammatory processes affecting the bilateral mesial temporal structures more pronounced on the left side. Antiseizure medication, benzodiazepines, and immunotherapy resulted in rapid seizure cessation. Subsequent MRI and PET indicated left hippocampal sclerosis and a left mesial temporal hypometabolism. Executive dysfunction resolved in the following weeks. Global amnesia persisted for almost three months. Two years later, episodic memory was normal with residual visual memory impairments. While this patient's seizure and cognitive outcome has been favorable, behavioral problems persisted long after disease onset. The persisting behavioral problems and subsequent MRI evidence (13 years after onset) of a swollen right amygdala indicated a possible relapse. This case report illustrates the importance of early diagnosis of LE for best clinical management. Antiseizure medication and immunotherapy led to seizure freedom and almost complete recovery of cognition. However, long-lasting neuropsychiatric symptoms and possible recurrent inflammation highlight the need for a multimodal long-term monitoring of such patients to rule out a relapse.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Epilepsy & behavior reports,10.1016/j.ebr.2022.100534,PMC8960971,Amnesia; Anti-amphiphysin associated limbic encephalitis; Autoimmune epilepsy; Behavior; Long-term outcome,Case Reports,United States,eng

Disulfiram poisoning in children is uncommon, can occur in children who have ingested large amount of drug because of careless and unsafe storage. Only few cases have been reported in literature. Although well tolerated by most patients, severe toxic side effects have been also reported including hepatitis, encephalopathy, psychosis, optic, and peripheral neuropathy. This is a case report of disulfiram toxicity in a 4.5-year girl who ingested 4-5 tablets of disulfiram (approximately 1-1.25 g) accidentally and presented with hypoglycemia and encephalopathy. After initial stabilization in emergency room, the child was shifted to intensive care unit (ICU) where the child was managed conservatively. Blood sugars normalized after 8 hours of admission. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed bilateral globus pallidus hyperintensity in T2-weighted (T2W) and diffusion-weighted (DW) images and hypointensity in T1-weighted (T1W) images including diffusion restriction. Acute disulfiram poisoning can occur in children who have ingested large amount of drug because of unsafe storage. It can lead to hepatitis, encephalopathy, psychosis, optic, and peripheral neuropathy. Mainstay of treatment is supportive care, airway protection, oxygen, and dextrose-containing intravenous fluid should be given. Acute disulfiram poisoning should be an important differential in diagnosis of any child presenting with idiopathic encephalopathy along with extrapyramidal symptoms with basal ganglia signal changes in MRI of brain in a previously healthy child.

The case of a woman in her 30s presenting with coprophagia and psychotic symptoms following hypoxic brain injury is reported. The case is discussed and literature is reviewed. We investigate cariprazine, a relatively new atypical antipsychotic for treating coprophagia, associated with psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation revealed cognitive dysfunction and psychotic symptoms. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was treated with haloperidol resulting in resolution of coprophagia. Attempts at switching to alternative antipsychotics, due to side effects, resulted in recurrence of coprophagia. Subsequent relapses required higher doses of haloperidol for remission of coprophagia and psychotic symptoms. She finally responded to cariprazine. While firm conclusions are not possible from the experience of a single case, we suggest cariprazine may also be a treatment option for coprophagia, particularly in patients with psychotic symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2022-248855,PMC9809258,Drugs: psychiatry; Psychotic disorders (incl schizophrenia),Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
19406605,Wernicke's encephalopathy presenting as acute psychosis after gastric bypass.,"Walker, Jonathan; Kepner, Andrew",Walker,"Patients frequently present to the Emergency Department (ED) with psychiatric complaints. The differential diagnosis for acute psychosis is extensive, and determining a possible etiology requires a thorough history and physical. Small details can help the physician in differentiating organic disease from non-organic disease. Many times patients are thought to be ""crazy"" without a thorough history and physical being done. In this case, the diagnosis hinged on the history of having gastric bypass surgery. A thorough physical examination was performed, and the patient had neurologic findings suggestive of severe thiamine deficiency. The patient's thiamine level was low. The patient was started on i.v. thiamine and slowly began to recover. Cerebral beriberi, more commonly known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, is a difficult diagnosis to make in the ED. A thorough neurologic examination is difficult to perform in the ED environment, but it is necessary when trying to determine the etiology of the patient's altered mental status. The number of patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy may increase with bariatric surgery becoming more common. This disease can present with a wide variety of findings, and the classic triad is not very common. With this in mind, the physician should have a low threshold for administering thiamine intravenously.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2009.03.025,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here, we provide a review of the available literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj, covering clinical and paraclinical presentation, tumour association, serological findings, and immunopathogenesis. Review of the peer-reviewed and PubMed-listed English language literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj. In addition, we provide an illustrative report on a new patient with ITPR1-IgG-associated encephalitis with cognitive decline and psychosis. So far, at least 31 patients with serum ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj have been identified (clinical information available for 21). The most common manifestations were ACA, encephalopathy with seizures, myelopathy, and (radiculo)neuropathy, including autonomic neuropathy. In 45% of cases, an underlying tumour was present, making the condition a facultative paraneoplastic neurological disorder. The neurological syndrome preceded tumour diagnosis in all but one case. In most cases, immunotherapy had only moderate or no effect. The association of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj with manifestations other than ACA is corroborated by the case of a 48-year-old woman with high-titre ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj antibodies and rapid cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention and executive function, and psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, investigated here in detail. FDG-PET revealed right-temporal glucose hypermetabolism compatible with limbic encephalitis. Interestingly, ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj mainly belonged to the IgG2 subclass in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in this and further patients, while it was predominantly IgG1 in other patients, including those with more severe outcome, and remained detectable over the entire course of disease. Immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins, was repeatedly followed by partial or complete recovery. Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide was paralleled by relative stabilization, although the patient noted clinical worsening at the end of each treatment cycle. The spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with ITPR1 autoimmunity is broader than initially thought. Immunotherapy may be effective in some cases. Studies evaluating the frequency of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj in patients with cognitive decline and/or psychosis of unknown aetiology are warranted.

This case report describes the course of a 26-year-old female who presented with new-onset seizures and insomnia, complicated by encephalitis. The initial workup ruled out common causes of encephalitis, while a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not identify a mass. Based on the suspicion that she may have autoimmune encephalitis, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange, but continued to deteriorate. Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan identified a small hypermetabolic pelvic mass. Shortly thereafter serum and cerebral spinal fluid NMDAR antibody titers were reported as positive, prompting repetition of the TVUS, which confirmed the presence of an ovarian teratoma. The patient had a laparoscopic oophorectomy with subsequent resolution of her symptoms, further confirming the diagnosis. Despite the sensitivities of TVUS and CT of up to 94% and 98%, respectively, the teratoma was unusually small, necessitating the addition of a PET scan to identify the lesion. These neoplasms are thought to have low uptake on PET; however, it is possible that focal inflammation may have enhanced the detection. It is unlikely that the teratoma grew during hospitalization as the average growth rate is 1.8 mm per year. Regardless, the lesson that can be learned is that imaging modalities beyond CT and TVUS, such as PET, can be helpful, as identification of a resectable tumor may alter management and ultimately improve outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,The neuroradiology journal,10.1177/1971400918763578,PMC6111422,NMDA receptor; PET; Seizures; encephalitis; psychosis; teratoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Three patients with NPH, diagnosed as per the consensus criteria, presenting as psychosis are described. Patient 1: Fifty-five-year-old lady with psychosis was found to have iNPH. She gave history of psychosis relieved with successful shunting of the hydrocephalus. She developed recurrence of psychosis each time the hydrocephalus recurred due to shunt malfunction and was relieved with correction of hydrocephalus with shunting. Patient 2 was a 67-year-old gentleman with long history of pyschosis with paranoid ideas. Five years after onset of illness, he developed gait apraxia, and a CT scan done showed normal pressure hydrocephalus. Patient 3 had bipolar illness since age of 60 years of age. He also developed gait apraxia 5 years into the illness and was diagnosed as having iNPH following imaging. All the patients had psychosis much before other features of iNPH developed. One of the patient's psychosis was temporally associated with onset and offset of hydrocephalus, thereby strongly supporting the causative nature of iNPH. iNPH though rare can be one of the causes for late onset secondary psychosis.",{},,Neurology India,10.4103/0028-3886.329621,,Dementia; normal pressure hydrocephalus; psychosis; shunt,Case Reports; Journal Article,India,eng

Although it is well known that anoxic or hypoxic injury produces acute neurologic deficits, DPL typically manifests days to weeks after apparent recovery from an obtunded state, and patients with DPL demonstrate cognitive impairment, high brain dysfunction, parkinsonism, or psychosis. MRI findings of the brain demonstrate deep white matter abnormalities. We report 2 cases of DPL after hypoxia due to benzodiazepine overdose. Both of our patients had normal arylsulfatase A activity. Although DPL is seen in carbon monoxide poisoning, pseudodeficiency of arylsulfatase A activity, or drug overdose with heroin or morphine, there are only some previous studies of DPL caused by an overdose with benzodiazepine. It is unclear whether neurotoxicity from the drug in addition to hypoxia alone is involved, however, it is important to note that overdose of common drugs as sleeping medicine can cause DPL. Since DPL may often be misdiagnosed and be subjected to unnecessary treatments, it is also important to understand its unique clinical course and MRI findings. With prompt recognition of DPL, we expect that more cases of DPL caused by overdose with benzodiazepine will be diagnosed, because benzodiazepine overdoses are common.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.52.672,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Because even the neurologic consultant may not be alert to the possibility of psychiatric symptoms alone heralding CNS pathology, the decision to augment the clinical impression with neuroradiologic or other brain imaging adjuncts (and to choose among them) may rest solely with the psychiatrist.

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may be a complication in some neurological diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of subacute psychosis and SIADH as the manifestation of HE, observed in the present case, has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man was hospitalized with a 4-month history of abnormal behaviors, including talkativeness, stopping consumption of coffee and cigarettes, hoarding garbage, and sleep disorders. On physical examination, increased and incoherent speech with flight of idea and delusion were observed. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28/30. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia due to SIADH and a positive result for anti-thyroid and anti-NH2 terminal of alpha-enolase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed only elevation of IL-6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable; however, (I-123)-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed extensive hyperperfusion involving the brainstem and bilateral frontal and medial temporal lobes. Electroencephalography showed generalized slow waves, but there were no epileptiform discharges. After 2 courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, his symptoms improved. Based on the findings of clinical features and steroid responsiveness, he was diagnosed with HE. Oral prednisolone and antipsychotic drugs were decreased without a relapse and he was discharged to his home.

Usually, abnormal MR enhancement and/or structural lesion(s) are present. Communicating hydrocephalus arises from meningeal arachnoid granulation involvement. Reported cases of obstructive hydrocephalus have all involved obstructing ventricular lesions. A 40-year-old African American man presented with papilledema, diplopia, and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed ""aqueductal stenosis"" without abnormal enhancement or obstructive lesion. Although symptoms resolved with shunting, he soon developed progressive psychotic symptoms. Serial MR scans remained free of abnormal enhancement or structural mass lesion(s) but revealed long repetition time and proton density signal changes within the medial temporal lobe structures and deep white matter that remained stable over 8 months despite clinical progression. Serial CSF studies were nondiagnostic. Open temporal lobe brain and meningeal biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomas within the parenchyma and meninges consistent with sarcoid. Total-body computed tomography scans ruled out systemic sarcoid. The patient steadily improved on steroid therapy. Neurosarcoid psychiatric symptoms are usually associated with diffuse meningeal enhancement from meningitis. Our case reveals that absence of abnormal enhancement or structural mass lesion on MR and normal CSF ACE levels do not rule out neurosarcoid.

The orbitofrontal cortex has been reported to be associated with manic states in bipolar disorder and with mania-inducing lesions. Head trauma commonly disrupts various cognitive functions, including attention and information processing. Traumatic brain injury patients have been shown to have greater posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus functional connectivity to the rest of the default mode network. We describe a case of secondary mania after head trauma 24 years ago with low blood flow in the orbitofrontal cortex, high blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex, and impaired cognitive functioning, including impaired attention and lowered processing speed. We describe a 30-year-old Japanese man with secondary mania and a medical history of head trauma 24 years ago. After head trauma at 6 years of age, the patient first showed apathy as a sign of frontal lobe impairment. After recovering, he experienced no psychiatric problems during adolescence, although he did show disinhibited behavior. At the onset of mania, low blood flow in the OFC and high blood flow in the PCC were observed as well as impaired cognitive function, including inattention and lowered processing speed. Abnormal cerebral blood flow was less prominent and cognitive dysfunction was partially recovered following recovery from mania, but his processing speed remained low. Although functional recovery from head trauma in childhood is better than that in adulthood, the brain may remain vulnerable for a long time. The risk of psychotic symptoms such as mania should be considered, even if sufficient superficial brain functional recovery is shown.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of general psychiatry,10.1186/s12991-020-00282-7,PMC7218518,"Brain injuries, traumatic; Manic state; Orbitofrontal cortex; Posterior cingulate cortex",Case Reports,England,eng

She eventually expired due to status epilepticus and subsequent significant respiratory complications. In the central nervous system, there was generalized brain atrophy, and patchy labeling of blood vessels by antibodies to complement component 4d (C4d) and membrane attack complex. Innumerable small patches with loss of cell bodies (neurons and glial cells in gray matter and glial cells in white matter) and demyelination were scattered throughout the brain and spinal cord. There was no cavitation and the passing axons were mostly preserved. Large solid calcified foci were present predominantly in the pons along with disseminated focal calcification involving neuron cell bodies, neurites, and capillaries. Patchy labeling of glial cells and linear structures suggestive of myelin sheaths with C4d antibodies was observed while immunostains for SV40, tau, β-amyloid, alpha synuclein, p62, and trans-activation response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa were negative.

There is a close temporal relationship between peri-ictal psychosis and seizures, and psychosis may present before (preictal), during (ictal) or after seizures (postictal). Epileptic psychoses usually have acute initial and final phases, with a short symptom duration and complete remission with a risk of recurrence. There is no temporal relationship between interictal or chronic psychosis and epileptic seizures. Another type of epileptic psychosis is related to the response to epilepsy treatment: epileptic psychosis caused by the phenomenon of forced normalisation (alternative psychosis), which includes epileptic psychosis secondary to epilepsy surgery. Although combination treatment with antiepileptic and neuroleptic drugs is now widely used to manage this condition, there are no standard treatment guidelines for epileptic psychosis. We present 5 cases of peri-ictal epileptic psychosis in which we observed an excellent response to treatment with levetiracetam. Good control was achieved over both seizures and psychotic episodes. Levetiracetam was used in association with neuroleptic drugs with no adverse effects, and our patients did not require high doses of the latter. Categorising psychotic states associated with epilepsy according to their temporal relationship with seizures is clinically and prognostically useful because it provides important information regarding disease treatment and progression. The treatment of peri-ictal or acute mental disorders is based on epileptic seizure control, while the treatment of interictal or chronic disorders has more in common with managing disorders which are purely psychiatric in origin. In addition to improving the patient's quality of life and reducing disability, achieving strict control over seizures may also prevent the development of interictal psychosis. For this reason, we believe that establishing a treatment protocol for such cases is necessary.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",10.1016/j.nrl.2012.03.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng; spa

192413,The neurological complications of cardiac transplantation.,"Hotson, J R; Pedley, T A",Hotson,"Review of the neurological complications encountered in 83 patients who received cardiac homografts over a seven-year period leads to the following conclusions: (1) Neurological disorders are common in transplant recipients, occurring in over 50 per cent of patients. (2) Infection was the single most frequent cause of the neurological dysfunction, being responsible for one-third of all CNS complications. (3) The infective organisms were typically those considered to be usually of low pathogenicity: fungi, viruses, protozoa and an uncommon bacterial strain. (4) Other clinical neurological syndromes were related to vascular lesions, often apparently from cerebral ischaemia or infarction occurring during the surgical procedure, metabolic encephalopathies, cerebral microglioma, acute psychotic episodes and back pain from vertebral compression fractures. (5) The infectious complications and probably the development of neoplasms de novo, are related to immunosuppressive therapy which impairs virtually all host defence mechanisms and alters the nature of the host's response to infective agents or other foreign antigens. (6) Because neurological symptoms and signs were usually those of behavioural changes or deterioration in intellectual performance, the neurological examination was often of little value in diagnosing the nature or even the anatomical site of the neuropathological process. (7) The possibility of an infectious origin of the neurological manifestations must be aggressively pursued even in the absence of fever and a significantly abnormal spinal fluid examination. The diagnostic error made most frequently was to ascribe neurological symptoms erroneously to metabolic disturbances or to ""intensive care unit psychosis"" when they were in fact due to unrecognized CNS infection. (8) Maintenance of mean cardiopulmonary bypass pressures above 70 mmHg, particularly in patients with known arteriosclerosis, may reduce operative morbidity. (9) Though increased diagnostic accuracy is possible with routine use of a variety of radiological and laboratory techniques, two further requirements probably must be met before a significant reduction in the frequency of neurological complications will occur: the advent of greater immunospecificity in suppressing rejection of the grafted organ while preserving defences against infection; and a more effective armamentarium of antiviral and antifungal drugs.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/99.4.673,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
15538316,[Persistent psychotic disorder following bilateral mesencephalo-thalamic ischaemia: case report].,"Predescu, A; Damsa, C; Riegert, M; Bumb, A; Pull, C",Predescu,"A 38-year old male patient with no history of psychiatric illness developed a progressive psychotic disorder after bilateral (predominantly left) mesencephalo-thalamic cerebral ischaemia. The reason of the emergency hospitalization was the sudden onset of a confusional state, culminating in a fluctuating comatose status. The neurological examination found mild right hemiparesia, praxic disorders and reactive left mydriasis with paresia of the downward vertical stare, leading to the hospitalisation in the neurology department for suspicion of a cerebral vascular ischaemic accident. The psychiatric symptoms started with acoustic-verbal hallucinations, poorly structured paranoid delusions, progressively developed over two weeks, followed by behavioural disorders with psychomotor agitation and heteroaggressivity. The patient was transferred to the psychiatric department, because of the heteroaggressive risk and lack of morbid consciousness, in spite of recovering from the confusional status. An intensive psychiatric management was proposed, combining a psychotherapeutic approach with 4 mg of risperidone and adjustable doses of benzodiazepine according to the psychomotor agitation. During the next days, there was a net recovery of the behavioural disorders, in spite of the persistence of the ideas of persecution. All the neurological symptoms also decreased. An anomaly of the polygon of Willis was found on a cerebral arteriography (the posterior cerebral arteries had a foetal origin, dependent on carotidal axes and not on the vertebro-basilar system). The main emboligen risk factor was the presence of a permeable foramen ovale, discovered during a transoesophageal echography. The patient underwent a surgical correction of the permeable foramen ovale. The psychiatric hospitalization for three months was continued by ambulatory follow-up. The initial positive symptoms (delusions, acoustic-verbal hallucinations) progressively diminished while negative symptoms became predominant after few months. One year after the first hospitalization the patient presented a second psychotic decompensation, with delusions of persecution, jealousy and behavioural disorders with heteroaggressivity, that required an emergency psychiatric hospitalization. The wife of the patient decided to divorce, because she was ""frightened by the threats of death"" from her husband. A neurological assessment during the second hospitalization in psychiatry did not find new ischaemic lesions after the cardiac surgery for the permeable foramen ovale, nor relevant changes in cerebral perfusion. The final diagnosis after the psychiatric follow-up of 14 months was: psychotic disorder with delusional ideas, due to cerebral ischaemia (DSM IV). There are relatively few data in the literature regarding persistent psychotic disorders in the context of ischaemic mesencephalo-thalamic lesions. However, several authors support the hypothesis of a possible disconnection of the thalamic nuclei, the frontal lobes and limbic system as a risk factor or a triggering factor for psychotic disorders in cerebral ischaemia. Observations concerning the occurrence of psychotic disorders following cerebral--especially localised--ischaemia may help to better understand the neuro-physiological mechanisms triggering or accompanying the psychiatric symptomatology. The role of functional cerebral imagery in the detection of possible structural lesions related to clinical observations must be emphasised. The slow progression (over a year) to psychotic disorder with predominantly negative symptoms emphasized the importance for long-term prospective studies. Isolated clinical observations arouse the interest for a specific scale for psychotic disorders occurring after cerebral ischaemia, similar to existing specific scale for post-ischaemic depressive disorders. The necessity of systematic psychiatric examination and re-evaluations in thalamic cerebral ischaemia is to be highlighted, both for the differential diagnosis and for the early psychiatric care.",{},,L'Encephale,10.1016/s0013-7006(04)95455-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

Encephalitis is a neurological syndrome due to brain parenchymal damage that can result in psychiatric symptoms including psychosis and behavioral changes. Its causes are usually infectious (usually viral) or autoimmune (Anti NMDA, AMPA, LGI1 or others). A psychiatric condition in bacterial meningitis without improvement with antibiotic treatment is remarkable, its presence should suggest an immune-mediated post-infectious syndrome that may respond to the use of immunomodulators even in the absence of identification of autoimmune encephalitis-associated antibodies.

The patient had cardiac valvulopathies that did not worsen. He had an ischemic stroke and developed a psychotic condition that was successfully treated by lowering the cabergoline and administering quetiapine and mirtazapine together. This regimen led to a small increase in the patient's prolactin that returned to previous levels and remained as such until the last medical evaluation. The tumor continued to shrink and had a cystic degeneration in the last evaluation. Combined use of cabergoline with quetiapine and mirtazapine to treat a psychotic crisis may have contributed to shrinking the tumor in our patient because these antipsychotics have action mediated by growth factors that interfere with growth of pituitary tumors.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-019-2071-2,PMC6571118,Cabergoline; Mirtazapine; Prolactinoma; Quetiapine; Resistance,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

32624069,Brief cognitive behavioural therapy for post-stroke 'delusional infestation' in a 71-year-old man: a single case experimental design.,"McKinnon, Aimee I; Dow, Rebecca",McKinnon,"Delusional infestation is a condition at the interface of tactile and visual hallucinations and delusions. Individuals with this condition hold the fixed and false belief that their body or their environment is infested with parasites, insects or other organisms. There are no guidelines or publications detailing the psychological assessment, formulation, intervention and evaluation of this presentation. This paper aims to address this gap. Single case experimental design methodology was employed to evaluate the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for delusional infestation in a 70-year-old male who was intolerant of anti-psychotic medication. 'Tom' had a large, mature infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory as well as a left posterior parietal infarct post-stroke, which may have precipitated his symptoms. After a baseline period of 3 weeks, Tom received eight sessions of CBT based on the model by Collerton and Dudley (2004). Post-intervention, there was a reliable improvement on clinical measures as well as a large reduction in distress levels, which was maintained at 3-month follow-up. The conviction in the belief that the infestation was real did not shift. This case demonstrated the potential for the use of CBT to address distress related to delusional infestation. This work is discussed in relation to post-stroke psychosis, psychological therapies with older adults, and suggestions are made for future research.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,10.1017/S1352465820000405,,CBT; cognitive behavioural therapy; delusional infestation; delusional parasitosis; older adult; organic hallucinosis; post-stroke psychosis; single case experimental design; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Medication for OUD such as methadone and buprenorphine are treatments for OUD, yet psychosis introduces additional challenges in retaining patients in care. Extended-release depot buprenorphine is an emerging option for the treatment of moderate-to-severe OUD, and it may provide certain benefits in patients with concurrent OUD and psychosis. We present the case of a 32-year-old man with schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, and OUD with a history of multiple opioid-related overdoses, followed by an assertive community treatment team, and subject to a community treatment order for both his primary psychotic disorder and OUD treatments.

Specifically, damage to the left cortical hemisphere may result in aphasia. The characteristic speech in a patient with an aphasia caused by a stroke can be similar to the speech in some patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. In a new patient without a reliable history who presents with suspected aphasia, it is important to include psychotic disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. Failure to differentiate psychotic disorders from aphasia could result in either a lack of treatment that would improve the patient's thought process, thought content, or language, or in a delayed treatment for a stroke, respectively. While a number of psychotic disorders exist and must be differentiated from one another in accordance with DSM-IV guidelines, speech abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia are well described in the literature. For this reason, schizophrenia is the psychotic disorder of focus in this paper. This case report illustrates a clinical situation where a patient required both a psychiatric and neurological consultation in order to determine the etiology of his language disorder. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need to consider both psychiatric disorders and aphasia in patients with unknown histories who present with language abnormalities, and to help the clinician critically examine the patient's speech so that, in conjunction with other clinical data, the correct diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment initiated.",{},,Clinical schizophrenia & related psychoses,10.3371/CSRP.4.4.6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Recent studies demonstrated that MDMA induces damage of serotonergic nerve terminals and alters hippocampal processing. Pronounced cognitive deficits in MDMA users affect learning and memory abilities. This pattern of predominant and long-lasting memory dysfunction suggests that the functioning of the hippocampus might be affected by the neurotoxic effects of MDMA. We present the case of a 16-year-old girl who developed an acute organic and psychotic syndrome caused by occasional use of low to moderate dose of MDMA. Serial neuroimaging ((18)F-FDG-PET and brain MRI) were correlated with her neurocognitive performance and clinical evolution. The structural and metabolic changes correlated with a severe cognitive impairment. After 16 months of intensive neuropsychological rehabilitation she showed significant improvement in hippocampal-related memory cognitive functions, which correlated with normalization of her (18)F-FDG-PET and remarkable hippocampal remodelling. This case report indicates that even non-chronic MDMA use may cause subacute toxic encephalopathy in which the clinical evolution is paralleled by neuroimaging changes in specific cerebral areas.

The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage.

Few reports have described patients with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis, and no cases of psychosis associated with this encephalitis have been reported. We report a patient with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis with Cotard and Capgras delusions who was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The patient was a 25-year-old woman. She exhibited disorientation, executive function deficits, tremors in the upper limbs, generalized athetoid-like involuntary movements, hallucinations, incontinence, and fever, which led to her admission to our hospital. Upon admission, she complained of Cotard delusions. Various diagnostic tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, antibody screening, and brain imaging, were unremarkable, except for positivity for serum anti-recoverin antibodies, non-specific general slowing on electroencephalography and decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the frontal and occipital lobes, and increased rCBF in the basal ganglia and pons on single-photon emission computed tomography. She was eventually diagnosed with encephalitis positive for anti-recoverin antibodies and treated with immunoglobulins and steroids. Her neurological symptoms improved temporarily, but three months later, psychiatric symptoms, i.e., suicidal thoughts and Cotard and Capgras delusions, were exaggerated. After ECT, her condition significantly improved. In conclusion, the present report suggests that pineal gland dysfunction due to anti-recoverin antibody or its cross-reactivity with neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins may contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis and that ECT can be a viable treatment option if immunotherapy proves ineffective. Additionally, decreased rCBF in the prefrontal cortex may be associated with the clinical features of Capgras and Cotard delusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1330745,PMC10850254,Capgras delusion; Cotard delusion; ECT; anti-recoverin antibody; case report; encephalitis; rCBF,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

There are multiple ways in which electricity can cause tissue damage, which can be due to direct effects, electroporation and thermal effects. However, these mechanisms fail to explain the enigmatous occurrences of diffuse and delayed neurological and psychological manifestations, especially those remote to the theoretical current pathway and in absence of any gross neurological abnormalities. Immediate neuropsychological sequelae have been well reported in the literature in the form of transient anxiety, emotional instability and memory disturbances. Among psychiatric manifestations, neurotic disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder, conversion and adjustment disorders have been appreciated many a times as a frequent accompaniment of these injuries. Occasional reports of occurrence of mania have also been recorded. This study reports a case of schizophrenia like illness following a low voltage electrical injury. A discussion regarding the ways in which electrical injury and schizophrenia like illness could be related has been put forth.

Six weeks post-psychiatric symptomatology, he presented with neurological symptoms such as faciobrachial jerking and tonic-clonic seizure. The patient had no previous psychiatric history and was initially treated with psychotropic medications. Our experience emphasises the fact that limbic encephalitis is not easy to identify as most patients initially present with psychiatric symptomatology than neurological symptoms. Furthermore, immunological and laboratory testing takes a rather long time to determine the diagnosis. What is more, few psychiatrists consider autoimmune nature of the neuropsychiatric presentation. Therefore, it is important to consider autoimmune encephalitis in patients with new-onset psychosis or mania who also present with neurological symptoms at some stage of their illness.

The myriad symptoms of limbic encephalitis make the diagnosis challenging. Symptoms range from seizures, memory loss, dementia, confusion, to psychosis. We present a case of a 21-year-old female with GAD65 antibody-positive limbic encephalitis. The case is unique because the clinical course suggests that non-convulsive seizures are the major cause of this patient's clinical manifestations. The following is the thesis: systemic autoimmune disease, associated with the GAD65 antibody, gives rise to seizures, in particular, non-convulsive seizures. Temporal lobes happen to be the most susceptible sites to develop seizures. The greater part of these seizures can be non-convulsive and hard to recognize without electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The variable symptoms mirror the severity and locations of these seizures.

15536303,Persistent severe depressive episode with mood-congruent psychotic features associated with left temporal ischemia.,"Ortiz, Nadia; Annoni, Jean-Marie; Trojan, Dante; Alberque, Christel; Eytan, Ariel",Ortiz,"The authors describe the case of a patient suffering from a persistent severe depressive episode with mood-congruent psychotic features following left temporal ischemia. Depression is a frequent disorder that may stem from psychosocial factors or occur after brain damage. Cases of poststroke depression with associated psychotic symptoms are rarely described in the literature, and, to our knowledge, no case of depression with psychotic symptoms in the presence of a focal lesion has yet been reported. History included psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropsychological as well as EEG data and CT scan and magnetic resonance images. Neurologic and psychiatric dimensions may be associated and difficult to disentangle, even when the patient presents the classic symptoms of a depressive disorder. This case underlines the importance of investigating possible neurologic signs or symptoms, even when the psychiatric presentation is prototypical of a determined mental disorder. This may be crucial for the patient's evolution.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/01.wnn.0000140168.25333.2b,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 35-year-old woman with MS presented with psychosis. There was no concurrent history of medication/substance use or family history. Comparison with previous MRI scans showed significant progression of lesions within the periventricular white matter of the left temporal lobe. This case highlights the association of psychosis and MS progression with worsening of left temporal lobe lesions. Prospective studies are required to ascertain the extent to which left temporal lobe lesions are predictive of future psychosis.,{},,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2005.02.017,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng
16024899,The first evaluation of brain shift during functional neurosurgery by deformation field analysis.,"Winkler, D; Tittgemeyer, M; Schwarz, J; Preul, C; Strecker, K; Meixensberger, J",Winkler,"Stereotactic surgery is based on a high degree of accuracy in defining and localising intracranial targets and placing surgical tools. Brain shift can influence its accuracy significantly. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus can markedly change the quality of life of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the outcome depends on the quality of electrode placement. A patient is reported in whom the placement of the second electrode was not successful. Deformation field analysis of pre- and postoperative three dimensional magnetic resonance images showed an intraoperative brain movement of 2 mm in the region of the subthalamic nucleus (the target point). Electrode repositioning resulted in efficient stimulation effects. This case report shows the need to reduce risk factors for intraoperative brain movement and demonstrates the ability of deformation field analysis to quantify this complication.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2004.047373,PMC1739770,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report four patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who presented neurological or psychiatric features. There were three women and one man, with a mean age of 68 years. Neurological presentations were various: seizures, psychotic episodes, altered consciousness, hallucinations without usual aetiological diseases (infectious, metabolic, neoplasic, vascular, etc.). Neurological investigations (EEG, brain CT, magnetic resonance imaging) were unspecific. In all cases, a moderately high CSF protein level without pleocytosis was found. Patients presented slight hypothyroidism with high titers of antithyroperoxidase antibodies. Despite hormone therapy replacement, neurological features persisted. Outcome was favorable under steroid therapy. Hashimoto's encephalopathy must be considered in the face of neuropsychiatric manifestations without obvious etiology. Pathogenic mechanisms are not clear but probably involve autoimmune cerebral vasculitis because of the efficacy of steroids.",{},,La Revue de medecine interne,10.1016/s0248-8663(01)00403-9,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

16573841,Progressive neurological disease induced by tacrolimus in a renal transplant recipient: case presentation.,"Chegounchi, Marjan; Hanna, Michael G; Neild, Guy H",Chegounchi,"Tacrolimus and cyclosporine, both calcineurin inhibitors, can cause neurological side effects. While mild symptoms such as tremor are well recognised, severe complications including seizures and encephalopathy are poorly documented following renal transplantation. We report a 42 year old man who received a cadaver renal transplant. He received tacrolimus and prednisolone. The course was uneventful for 6 weeks when he became intermittently confused, with unsteady gait and slurred speech. Following a grand mal convulsion he was admitted. He had no focal neurological signs, cerebrospinal fluid was normal; electroencephalogram was consistent with temporal lobe partial epilepsy. The magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed widespread changes with multiple areas of low signal intensity in brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. He was readmitted 3 weeks later after further fits, despite anti-convulsant therapy. He was psychotic with visual hallucinations, and rapidly became obtunded. Although his tacrolimus blood concentration had been kept in the normal range, his symptoms improved dramatically when the tacrolimus was stopped. Severe central nervous system toxicity from calcineurin inhibitors has been rarely reported in renal transplantation and we found only one report of tacrolimus-induced toxicity in an adult. We believe the condition is frequently undiagnosed. It is a very important diagnosis not to miss as the remedy is simple and failure may result in unnecessary brain biopsy, as well as irreversible injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,BMC nephrology,10.1186/1471-2369-7-7,PMC1440850,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Structural or functional anatomical abnormalities have mostly been found in the prefrontal cortex, the corpus callosum, the striatum, and the cerebellum. We here present the case of an adult woman who developed severe symptoms analogous to ADHD after right temporal lobectomy. Surgery had been necessary because of a large temporobasal arterio-venous malformation (AVM). The patient's childhood and personal history before surgery had been without any indication of ADHD or any other mental disorder. Because of her distinct and impairing symptoms of ADHD, we initiated off-label methylphenidate treatment, achieving strong reduction in the symptoms. This proves further similarity of her symptomatic disorder to ADHD and supports a role of the right temporal lobe in ADHD.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders,10.1007/s12402-015-0184-z,,Methylphenidate; Secondary ADHD; Symptomatic ADHD; Temporal lobe; Temporal lobectomy,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

We present a relatively rare case of antileucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis that developed only psychiatric symptoms at the onset. The patient was a male in his 40s who developed anxiety and panic symptoms and was started on antidepressants after being diagnosed with panic disorder by a psychiatrist. He visited our hospital 2 months later presenting with hallucinations, delusions, mild cognitive decline, and faciobrachial dystonic seizures in the left upper extremity and face. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging revealed swelling and hyperintensities in the right caudate nucleus and putamen. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not show increased protein levels or cell counts and revealed positive oligoclonal bands. Subsequently, positive results for anti-LGI1 antibodies were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with anti-LGI1 encephalitis. This case highlights the need to consider anti-LGI1 encephalitis therapy in patients with acute-onset psychiatric symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,PCN reports : psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1002/pcn5.181,PMC11114381,antileucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 encephalitis; anti‐N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; psychosis; seizures,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng
