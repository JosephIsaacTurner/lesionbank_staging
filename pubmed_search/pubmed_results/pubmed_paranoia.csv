28157747,Cardioembolic Stroke.,"O'Carroll, Cumara B; Barrett, Kevin M",O'Carroll,"Cardioembolic stroke is common and disproportionately more disabling than nonembolic mechanisms of stroke. Its incidence is expected to rise because of the age-related incidence of atrial fibrillation and an aging population. This article summarizes the different causes of cardioembolism and outlines current management guidelines. Since cardioembolic stroke is not a single disease entity, its diagnosis requires initial clinical suspicion and a comprehensive evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography, brain imaging, and cardiac monitoring. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended. This article reviews risk stratification models to assist in the decision-making process and highlights the increased use of novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. New data support the importance of prolonged cardiac monitoring for diagnosing occult atrial fibrillation. Current data on other mechanisms of cardioembolic stroke, such as prosthetic heart valves and aortic arch atherosclerosis, are also presented, and the available evidence regarding patent foramen ovale closure in cryptogenic stroke is summarized. Cardioembolism is an important cause of ischemic stroke, with diverse underlying mechanisms requiring a tailored approach to diagnosis, management, and prevention.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000419,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review",United States,eng
29419420,Diaphragmatic flutter.,"Walton, Dean; Bonello, Michael; Steiger, Malcolm",Walton,"A 78-year-old woman presented with involuntary movements of her abdomen, which started after a right hemispheric stroke. She had irregular, variable, hyperkinetic predominantly right-sided abdominal wall movements. MR scan of brain confirmed a recent infarct in the right occipitotemporal lobe and the right cerebellum. Diaphragmatic fluoroscopy confirmed high-frequency flutter as the cause of her abdominal movements and confirmed the diagnosis of van Leeuwenhoek's disease. Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek first described this condition in 1723 and had the condition himself. He was a Dutch businessman who is often acknowledged as the first microscopist and microbiologist. He disagreed with his physician who attributed his ailment as being of cardiac origin. Diaphragmatic flutter is a rare disorder that requires a high index of suspicion with symptoms including abnormal abdominal wall movements, dyspnoea and respiratory distress. Despite medical treatment, the patient was still highly symptomatic, so she is currently being considered for a phrenic nerve crush.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Practical neurology,10.1136/practneurol-2017-001830,,diaphragmatic flutter; diaphragmatic myoclonus; movement disorders,Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Portrait,England,eng
35145781,Hypocalcemia-Induced Reversible Psychosis.,"Hall, Andrea; Bin Farooq, Talha; Alcaraz, Renato",Hall,"Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.20874,PMC8805771,delusions; hypoparathyroidism; metabolic psychosis; reversible; s: hypocalcemia,Case Reports,United States,eng
37968851,Stroke in Tuberculous Meningitis.,"Becerra-Aguiar, Naomi Nazareth; Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; Gutierrez-Baeza, Daniel Mateo; Aguilar-Fuentes, Victor; Ruiz-Sandoval, José Luis",Becerra-Aguiar,"A 17-year-old male presented with a 20-day history of vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, headache and fever progressing to dysarthria, somnolence, urinary incontinence, slurred speech, weakness, and inability to walk. Neurological examination revealed diminished visual acuity and diplopia. A head computed tomography (CT) showed acute hydrocephalus (Figure 1). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed pleocytosis (lymphocyte predominant), hypoglycorrhachia (8 mg/dL), and hyperproteinorrachia (156 mg/dL). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed leptomeningitis, basal ganglia infarcts and basal meningeal enhancement highly suggestive of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) (Figure 2). We calculated a positive Thwaites score (-5) for TBM. The patient responded well to antituberculous treatment and dexamethasone. At 2 year follow-up the patient remains symptom-free. Stroke is a frequent complication of TBM and might contribute to long-term disability. Brain imaging findings, such as basal meningeal enhancement and basal exudates, hydrocephalus, and infarctions (TBM triad) are useful tools to rapidly identify probable TBM(3,4). Brain infarcts in TBM are located mostly in the arterial territory of distal branching arterires(5). Other less frequent imaging findings are tuberculomas and vasospasm. Key message: Hydrocephalus, basal meningeal enhancement, and basal ganglia infarcts should raise suspicion of tuberculosis, especially in endemic regions.",{},,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,China (Republic : 1949- ),eng
38046734,Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.,"Cazzaniga, Juliana; Jara Silva, Cesar E; Quinonez, Jonathan; Ruxmohan, Samir; Leyva, Melissa M; Fahs, Abrahim",Cazzaniga,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune condition characterized by recurrent episodes of optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis. This case report aims to highlight the importance of considering atypical presentations of NMOSD when confronted with MRI-detected Wernicke's encephalopathy. The primary target in NMOSD is the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein, predominantly located on astrocyte surfaces. Antibodies binding to AQP4 can lead to astrocyte dysfunction and damage, contributing to NMOSD's distinctive pathology. The associated immune response and inflammation can cause secondary harm to various components of the central nervous system, including oligodendrocytes and neuronal axons. This inflammatory process results in perivascular demyelination and axonal injury, further aggravating neurological deficits in NMOSD. In this case, we present a 39-year-old female with no prior medical or surgical history who sought medical attention due to a three-week history of progressive eyelid heaviness and somnolence. NMOSD is an autoimmune condition primarily targeting the AQP4 protein, resulting in recurrent ON and transverse myelitis. The patient was initially misdiagnosed with myasthenia gravis due to somnolence and ptosis. Due to concerns about myasthenia gravis due to diffuse fatigue and bilateral ptosis, the patient was initially treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and admitted to the neurology service. On the first day of her hospitalization, MRI with and without contrast revealed extensive, non-enhancing T2-weighted-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) hyperintensities surrounding the third ventricle and affecting the periaqueductal grey, medial thalami, and mammillary bodies. There was also an interval increase in T2-FLAIR hyperintensity within the right medial temporal lobe, extending more posteriorly and inferiorly, abutting the temporal horn. Subsequent CSF encephalitis panel results showed positive West Nile virus (WNV) IgG but negative WNV IgM, and AQP4 antibodies were positive. Given the high specificity of AQP4 antibodies, the patient was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) encephalitis. This case underscores the importance of considering atypical presentations of NMO when confronted with MRI-detected Wernicke's encephalopathy. Since our patient primarily displayed somnolence and eye-related symptoms, neither NMO nor Wernicke's encephalopathy were initially considered in the differential diagnosis. Furthermore, despite MRI findings suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy, it was considered less likely due to the absence of thiamine deficiency and consistent denials by family members regarding alcohol use, gastrointestinal issues, or inadequate oral intake. This case underscores the importance of considering NMOSD in patients with atypical symptoms, even when initial presentations suggest other conditions. Timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent mismanagement and improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for NMOSD, especially when MRI findings do not align with the initial diagnosis, as early recognition and treatment can significantly impact patient care and prognosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48168,PMC10693445,autoimmune neurological disease; brain anatomy; neurology and critical care; neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; wernicke's encephalopathy,Case Reports,United States,eng

Disruption of blood flow from a carotid-cavernous fistula can cause cortical and cranial nerve ischemia which requires emergent intervention.

31732541,Case of non-alcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy.,"Theodoreson, Mark D; Zykaite, Ausrine; Haley, Michael; Meena, Saroj",Theodoreson,"A 61-year-old obese man presented with 8-week history of nausea and occasional vomiting. He reported poor appetite and unintentional weight loss of more than 20 kg of his body mass. A week after admission, he developed double vision and unsteady gait. Neurological examination revealed isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy on the left side with horizontal nystagmus that progressed to bilateral lateral gaze palsy with normal vertical gaze. Brain MR revealed T2/fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) high signal in mammillary bodies, tectum of the midbrain and the periaqueductal grey matter. He was diagnosed with Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). WE is a medical emergency that carries high mortality yet can be often under-diagnosed in the non-alcoholic patient.

9090024,Tanycytic ependymoma.,"Langford, L A; Barré, G M",Langford,"Tanycytic ependymoma is an uncommon fibrillar variant of ependymoma characterized by streams of piloid, or hair-like, cells having ""ependymal"" nuclei. True ependymal rosettes are absent, and perivascular rosettes are inconspicuous. Misinterpretation as schwannoma or astrocytoma is a diagnostic problem and well-documented cases are scarce. The purpose of this report is to document the ependymal features of the neoplasm and to increase awareness of the entity's existence. Biopsy tissues from three patients with tanycytic ependymoma were examined. All tumors consisted of sheets of spindle cells that were positive for glial fibrillary acidic and S-100 proteins. Ultrastructural examination showed characteristic ependymal features, including intracytoplasmic intermediate filaments, prominent intercellular junctions, numerous slender surface microvilli, and microvilli-lined lumina. Accurate recognition of the ependymal nature of this spindle neoplasm requires a high index of suspicion. Because the spindle cells are immunoreactive with antibodies to both glial fibrillary acidic and S-100 proteins, ultrastructural confirmation of ependymal features is necessary.",{},,Ultrastructural pathology,10.3109/01913129709021312,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report the cases of two female patients, aged 23 and 37 years, who exhibited the clinical and radiologic features of a space-occupying mass strongly suggestive of neoplasia. In both patients, magnetic resonance imaging showed a ring-enhancing parietal lesion. Intraoperative frozen sections in both patients displayed histologic features strongly suggestive of a glial neoplasm, including marked hypercellularity, a prominent astrocytic component, and easily identifiable mitotic figures. However, permanent sections showed additional and helpful histologic findings that included Creutzfeldt astrocytes and granular mitoses. Subsequent immunostaining showed that the hypercellularity was principally caused by macrophage infiltration (HAM-56 and CD68) and an associated reactive astrocytosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein). Additional confirmatory tests included special stains for myelin (Luxol-fast-blue), which demonstrated focal, sharply marginated loss of myelin, and for axons (silver stain for axons and neurofilament protein immunohistochemistry), which showed relative preservation of axons in areas of myelin loss. Together, the special stains confirmed the demyelinating nature of the lesions. The keys to avoiding misdiagnosing a demyelinating pseudotumor as a diffuse glioma include a general awareness of this potential pitfall, including the radiologic appearance of demyelinating pseudotumors as contrast-enhancing solitary masses that mimic tumor; knowledge of the characteristic histologic features, including Creutzfeldt astrocytes and granular mitoses; and a high index of suspicion for macrophage infiltration combined with a willingness to use appropriate confirmatory immunohistochemical studies in suspicious or uncertain cases. This approach will minimize the chance of misdiagnosis and subsequent use of inappropriate and deleterious therapies.",{},,Annals of diagnostic pathology,10.1053/adpa.2002.35737,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
26566040,Bilateral Paramedian Thalamic Infarction.,"Hawkes, Maximiliano A; Arena, Julieta E; Rollán, Cecilia; Pujol-Lereis, Virginia A; Romero, Carlos; Ameriso, Sebastián F",Hawkes,"Rarely, both paramedian thalami receive arterial blood flow from a single unilateral vessel arising from the first segment of 1 posterior cerebral artery. This artery has received the name of artery of Percheron (AP). There is no consensus regarding the true prevalence of this anatomical variant. Bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts are uncommon (0.1% to 2% of ischemic strokes). The main cause is the occlusion of the AP due to cardioembolism. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates the lesion in the acute setting. From September 2004 to October 2011, we identified 5 patients who had bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts. We describe clinical findings and diagnostic imaging patterns observed in these cases and review the literature. Three men and 2 women with bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction probably due to occlusion of AP are described. Mean age at presentation was 58±24 years. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the lesion in all patients. Four patients presented loss of consciousness as initial symptom. Only 1 patient evidenced mesencephalic extension of the infarct on magnetic resonance imaging, although 4 presented abnormal ocular signs. No patients received intravenous thrombolisis because of delayed diagnosis. All patients were discharged home. A 90-year-old woman recovered completely and the other 4 subjects persisted with cognitive symptoms and gaze abnormalities. Clinical presentation and imaging patterns described in this group of patients were similar to published data. High level of suspicion based on clinical and imaging findings is essential for early diagnosis of this rare condition.

After surgical resection of the cerebellar abscess and culture-based antibiotic treatment, the patient suffered repeat hemorrhages into the abscess cavity, of which he died. We describe his clinical course with emphasis on radiology-based differential diagnosis. We also describe the possible pathogenesis of this rare case, based on review of the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first report on recurrent hemorrhages in a cerebellar abscess. Hemorrhagic brain abscess has a complex radiologic appearance, which may delay diagnosis and treatment.

We report the case of a 51-year-old woman with previous biopsy-proven MCD in remission who presented with worsening headache and acute confusion shortly after a relapse of the NS and was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) complicated by intracranial hemorrhage and midline shift. One month prior, she had been initiated on an oral contraceptive agent during remission of the NS. After initiation of systemic anticoagulation, her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she passed away before being able to undergo catheter-based venous thrombectomy. We conducted a systematic literature review and identified 33 case reports of adults with NS-associated CVT. The most common symptoms were headache (83%), nausea or vomiting (47%), and altered mental status (30%). 64% of patients presented at time of initial diagnosis of the NS and 32% during a relapse.

PCNSV can present with a wide variety of neurological manifestations and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke, particularly if the neurological deficit cannot be explained by the affected vascular area or when it is multifocal. The diagnosis of PCNSV is relevant because the required therapy differs from the treatments commonly used for frequent ischemic strokes. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman admitted for an ischemic stroke with a right frontal cortico-subcortical ischemic lesion. The etiological investigation documented multiple intracranial arterial stenoses. Secondary causes of central nervous system vasculitis were excluded. The patient refused a brain biopsy, and corticosteroid therapy was initiated due to high suspicion of PCNSV, supported by findings from transcranial Doppler ultrasound and brain magnetic resonance angiography. The patient had a positive clinical outcome and did not have any recurrences while under therapy.

He had been evaluated and diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as well as amphetamine and hash use disorder until recently, when the team noticed a poor response to treatment and the continuation of his cognitive features. After a reevaluation of the history and evidence of the brain lesions on the MRI, the diagnosis was changed to bipolar disorder due to a traumatic brain injury. The patient had shown a fair response to valproate and risperidone. This report emphasizes the significance of ruling out the medical factors contributing to the manifestation of any novel psychiatric symptom, necessitating greater attention to the account of cranial trauma and periods of unconsciousness. Psychiatrists should be aware of these overlooked cases and encourage colleagues in the field to maintain a high index of suspicion and to take a good relevant history of brain injury insults, especially when there are cognitive features and a poor response to medications. The patient exhibited symptoms of inattention, memory difficulties, reasoning deficits, and poor judgment, but he did not meet the criteria for a minor or major cognitive disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.51292,PMC10824366,bipolar disorder; frontal lobe; schizoaffective disorder; substance use disorder.; traumatic brain injury (tbi),Case Reports,United States,eng

She successfully underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for total occlusion of the basilar artery and made full neurological recovery. Initial ultrasound Doppler of legs (USDL) did not show any deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, 2 days later, a repeat USDL revealed an extensive proximal DVT in the right common femoral vein. CT scan confirmed a haematoma arising from the femoral access site causing compression of the adjacent common femoral vein. This may have initiated DVT formation or exacerbated extension of a previously undetected DVT. Echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale. As the patient was asymptomatic, delayed or missed diagnosis of DVT would have put her at risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism or further strokes.

The diagnosis of heat stroke requires a high index of suspicion if the patient has been exposed to a high-temperature environment. Central nervous system dysfunction is a cardinal feature. Strict adherence to temperature criteria can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. A 37-year-old construction worker was brought in by his wife and coworker due to a sudden loss of consciousness while resting after completing his work. Due to challenges faced during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as well as language barriers, a detailed history from the coworker who witnessed the patient's altered sensorium was not available. He was initially suspected of having encephalitis and brainstem stroke. However, subsequent investigations revealed multiorgan dysfunction with a normal brain computed tomography and cerebral computed tomography angiogram. In view of the multiple risk factors for heat stroke, pupillary constriction, and urine color suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, a diagnosis of heat stroke was made. Despite delayed diagnosis, the patient's multiorgan dysfunction recovered within days with basic supportive care. There were no noticeable complications on follow-up 14 months later. Heat stroke can be easily confused with other neurological pathologies, particularly if no history can be obtained from the patient or informant.

Herein, we present a case of delayed CVT diagnosis due to nonspecific neurological symptoms and nonprominent lesions in a patient with HH. A 65-year-old woman presented with a sudden onset headache accompanied by right HH that lasted for 1 day. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were initially performed due to suspicion of ischemic lesions or hemorrhage in the left postchiasmal visual pathway; however, no remarkable acute brain lesions were detected. Ophthalmological examinations revealed no notable findings, except for a definite field defect in the Humphrey visual field test. The headaches then waxed and waned but recurred 3 days after the initial symptom.A repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which revealed left sectoral gyral swelling and vascular enhancement in the occipital lobe. To further evaluate venous drainage, additional 3-dimensional cerebral computed tomography angiography and 4-vessel angiography were conducted, revealing a partial filling defect in the left transverse sinus and superior venous drainage impairment. These findings suggested the presence of venous thrombosis in the left transverse sinus. The patient was diagnosed with thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, which subsequently caused the right HH. Anticoagulation therapy with parenteral heparin was started as soon as the diagnosis of CVT was confirmed. Eventually, the patient was solely managed with oral warfarin administration. Following 3 days of treatment, her headache resolved, and a subsequent visual field testing conducted 2 weeks later revealed a definite improvement in the field defect. Despite its favorable prognosis, CVT can be challenging to diagnose. CVT should be considered as a differential diagnosis when diagnosing patients who present with headaches accompanied by HH without prominent brain lesions.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000036204,PMC10754574,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present a rare case of HSV-2 encephalitis after craniotomy and describe its pathophysiology and optimal management. A 70-year-old woman underwent an elective resection of a recurrent left sphenoid wing meningioma and clipping of a left middle cerebral artery aneurysm, the latter having been found incidentally. She returned to our department with clinical findings suggestive of meningitis 12 days after the operation. Her lack of response to empiric antibiotic treatment, taken together with the lymphocyte-predominant initial cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture and the electroencephalographic indications of encephalopathy, led to the suspicion of a diagnosis of HSE, which was later confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction test positive for HSV-2. The patient was then successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir for 2 weeks followed by another week of oral acyclovir treatment before being discharged. The present case stresses the importance of recognizing the relatively rare entity of HSE after craniotomy.

To date, only 40 intracranial lesions have been reported, and in all instances, they were found as a solitary calcified mass. To our knowledge, the current case report is the first to illustrate the development of multiple intraaxial CAPNONs and shed more light on the origin of these lesions. We discuss the case of a 67-year-old woman who presented with a six-year history of recurrent seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed two similar heterogeneous intracranial masses in the ventral midbrain and left frontal white matter with indications of more aggressive behavior in the supratentorial tumor. The lesion was resected, and histopathological analysis showed tissue containing nodules of chondromyxoid material with a coarsely fibrillar matrix and focal alveolar pattern. Palisading cells were noted around the edges as well as dystrophic calcifications and osseous metaplasia, consistent with CAPNON. Interestingly, the patient had a previous history of multiple brain abscesses and a mycotic aneurysm. At her four-month follow-up visit, the patient remained seizure-free and there were no indications of residual tumor or recurrence. In contrast to previous reports, intracranial CAPNONs may manifest as multiple lesions and clinicians should include these tumors in the differential diagnosis of intra-axial calcified masses. The previous history of brain abscesses raises the suspicion of an abnormal proliferative process following an insult to the brain tissue as the underlying origin of these lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.1044,PMC5360384,benign; calcified pseudoneoplasm; supratentorial; tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

The diagnosis can easily be missed when there is an explanation for the clinical symptoms that the cancer can mimic. We present the case of a primigravid patient whose choriocarcinoma was initially missed as a result of seemingly obvious explanations for her atypical history and disease manifestation. The patient is a Caucasian female at 30 weeks and 5 days of gestation who presented with persistent headaches and new-onset tonic-clonic seizures found on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to have a left intracranial hematoma, a 5 mm midline shift, and multiple foci of restricted diffusion. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The fetus was emergently delivered 1 week into hospitalization for non-reassuring fetal heart tracings in the setting of maternal lethargy secondary to continued AVM hemorrhage. The patient's hospital course was complicated by four episodes of intracranial bleeding and edema requiring neurosurgical intervention. Three weeks after hospitalization she was discharged to a rehabilitation center, shortly after which placental biopsy demonstrated choriocarcinoma. MRI after readmission demonstrated extensive metastatic disease and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were greater than 225,000 mIU/mL. Despite two additional neurosurgical procedures and extensive chemotherapy the patient died 3 months after initial presentation. Choriocarcinoma is extremely rare in viable pregnancies, but it should be considered when a parturient presents with intracranial bleeding. A high level of suspicion and serial serum hCG levels may lead to early and potentially life-saving multidrug chemotherapy. With a broader differential, earlier hCG measurement, and earlier treatment, our patient may have survived.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of medical cases,10.14740/jmc3898,PMC8993443,Arteriovenous malformation; Choriocarcinoma; Gestational trophoblastic disease; Human chorionic gonadotropin; Intracranial hemorrhage,Case Reports,Canada,eng

Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed evidence of a subacute cerebral infarct with hemorrhagic transformation in the right superior parietal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast revealed a small thrombosed cortical vein with surrounding hemorrhage and edema in the same location, in addition to a partial thrombosis of the adjacent superior sagittal sinus, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance venogram (MRV). Although cerebral angiography was performed, no intervention was attempted for the partially occluded sagittal sinus. HIV viral load was undetectable with a robust cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 count on therapy. The patient was treated with strict blood pressure control, a statin, and a heparin drip. He remained stable and was discharged on enoxaparin injections with bridging to warfarin. In summary, appropriate lab testing, imaging, and high clinical suspicion are required for proper diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or CVST in an HIV-positive patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.13694,PMC8019322,case report; cerebral venous sinus thrombosis; cerebral venous thrombosis; cerebrovascular accidents; cvst; hiv; thrombosis; thrombotic coagulopathy; venous thromboembolism; vte,Case Reports,United States,eng

This study aimed to report the clinical course, imaging features, and therapeutic response of MOG-IgG-associated cortical/brainstem encephalitis. Data of four patients who suffered from cortical encephalitis with epileptic seizures and/or brainstem encephalitis during the course of the disease were retrospectively collected and analyzed. In this study, three male patients and one female patient, with a median age of onset of 21 years (ranging 20-51 years) were enrolled. An epileptic seizure was the main symptom of cortical encephalitis in these patients, while the manifestations of brainstem encephalitis were diverse. Cranial MRI demonstrated abnormal signals in unilateral or bilateral cortical or brainstem. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed normal or mildly elevated leukocyte counts and protein levels, and a cell-based assay detected positive MOG-IgG in the serum of all patients. Two patients were misdiagnosed at the first attack, and both experienced a relapse. All of them accepted the first-line immunotherapy after a confirmed diagnosis and had a good outcome. Early suspicion of MOG-IgG-associated encephalitis is necessary for any patient with sudden onset of seizures or symptoms of brainstem damage, especially with lesions on unilateral/bilateral cortical or brainstem on brain MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.775181,PMC8813978,brainstem encephalitis; cortical encephalitis; epileptic seizures; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A mechanism similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was proposed with antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Vaccine related arterial thrombosis in the brain is rare but life-threatening and optimal treatment is not established. We report clinical, laboratory, imaging findings and treatment in a 51-year-old female presenting with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion 7 days after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Due to low platelet count and suspicion of VITT she was not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and proceeded to mechanical thrombectomy (MER) with successful recanalization four hours after onset of symptoms. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux was initiated. Presence of anti-PF4 antibodies was confirmed. The patient improved clinically with normalization of platelet count. Clinicians should be alert of VITT in patients with acute ischemic stroke after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination and low platelet counts. MER showed to be feasible and effective. We propose considering MER in patients with VITT and large vessel occlusion despite thrombocytopenia. High-dose IVIG should be started immediately. Alternative anticoagulation to heparin should be started 24 hours after stroke onset unless significant hemorrhagic transformation occurred. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated and should be considered only in severe hemorrhagic complications. Restenosis or reocclusion of the revascularized artery is possible due to the hypercoagulable state in VITT and angiographic surveillance after the procedure is reasonable.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.106072,PMC8397593,Mechanical thrombectomy; Stroke; Thrombocytopenia; VITT,Case Reports,United States,eng

In subacute cases, the main symptoms are secondary to increased intracranial pressure. This condition is associated with an extensive range of medical disorders, but only 2% are caused by a CNS infection in recent series. We report a 45-year-old patient, with no previous medical history, who developed a syndrome of increased intracranial pressure as the presentation of a cryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CM) complicated with a CVT. The patient was first diagnosed of a CVT, and later on, the VIH infection and the CM diagnosis were made. Despite being treated with anticoagulation, liposomal amphotericin B, and a therapeutic lumbar puncture, the patient continued to deteriorate and suffered a respiratory arrest secondary to the increased intracranial pressure, with subsequent brain death. Cryptococcus is an infrequent cause of CNS infection in developed countries, despite being the most frequent cause of meningits in adults in several countries with high rates of HIV infection. CVT is a very rare complication of CM which can contribute to worsen the increased intracranial pressure and in consequence, its prognosis and outcome. A high level of suspicion is needed for diagnosing CM as the underlying cause of CVT and the subsequent increased intracranial pressure should be managed exhaustively.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of neurovirology,10.1007/s13365-019-00813-3,,Cerebral venous thrombosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; Fungal infections; HIV; Meningitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although other vascular lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis, HBMs rarely resemble aneurysms on neuroimaging and only 1 case of a cerebellar HBM mimicking a posterior fossa aneurysm has been reported. Here we describe a retromedullary HBM that masqueraded as a distal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) medullary branch aneurysm. A 63-year-old asymptomatic male was incidentally diagnosed with an unruptured 3-mm left PICA aneurysm via computed tomography angiography during a workup for carotid stenosis. Two years later, the presumed aneurysm enlarged to 6.5 mm and prompted elective treatment. Endovascular treatment was unsuccessful, and the patient was immediately transitioned to a craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. After microsurgical dissection, the lesion was visualized on the posterior medullary surface with several small arterial feeders extending from the brainstem into the aneurysm dome, but no major parent vessel was observed. Because a clip could not be safely applied to these small vessels, they were instead coagulated and the lesion was completely resected. Final pathology revealed hemangioblastoma (World Health Organization grade I). To our knowledge, this is the second case of HBM mimicking a PICA aneurysm. Given the rarity of PICA medullary branch aneurysms and their highly symptomatic nature, other etiologies, especially HBM, should be strongly considered when an apparent distal PICA aneurysm is diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient. If the lesion is unamenable to endovascular treatment, there should be high suspicion for HBM and subsequent craniotomy should be pursued.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.10.188,,Hemangioblastoma; PICA aneurysm; Retromedullary vascular lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

We report a case of a 17-year-old male diagnosed with T-LBL, who had been receiving MTX chemotherapy for 4 months. After receiving his fourth dose of MTX, he presented to the emergency department with fever, facial drooping, and acute left-sided weakness.

Among others, determining causality between ischemic stroke and patent foramen ovale (PFO) remains a complicated task for stroke neurologists, given the relatively high prevalence of PFOs. Thorough diagnostic workup to identify incidental vascular risk factors and rare embolic sources is crucial to avoid premature PFO closure suggesting successful secondary stroke prevention. In this paper, we report on a 38-year-old patient with recurrent vertebrobasilar territory, especially right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory strokes. After the initial suspicion of a left vertebral artery (VA) dissection was not confirmed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other major risk factors were excluded, a PFO was detected and closed. Successful PFO closure was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography, yet recurrent transient-ischemic attacks and vertebrobasilar strokes, especially during nighttime and in the early morning, occurred despite various antiplatelet and antithrombotic regimes and a persistent right-to-left shunt was detected by bubble transcranial Doppler. Finally, MRI after another vertebrobasilar infarction detected a transient left VA occlusion that finally led to the diagnosis of a left VA pseudoaneurysm from an incident emboligenic dissection in the atlas segment. This pseudoaneurysm together with an anatomical variant of the right PICA originating with the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery from the basilar artery finally explained the recurrent ischemic events of the patient. After successful treatment with coil occlusion, the patient suffered no further stroke and recovered completely. In summary, stroke in the young remains a diagnostic challenge. The incidental finding of a PFO should not deter from thorough stroke workup and the follow-up of these patients including PFO closure verification should be performed under the guidance of vascular neurologists.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Brain circulation,10.4103/bc.bc_61_21,PMC8973451,Embolic stroke of undetermined source; etiology; patent foramen ovale; pseudoaneurysm; risk of paradoxical embolism; stroke; vertebral artery dissection; young,Case Reports,India,eng

A 49-year old man presented with right temporal IPH following an ATV accident and was found to have a right MMAVF on cerebral angiography. The MMAVF appeared on angiography to be unruptured, and therefore was not immediately treated. Later in admission, the patient suffered a new spontaneous IPH ipsilateral to the MMAVF, suggesting a re-rupture. Endovascular transarterial embolization with ethyl vinyl alcohol resulted in complete obliteration of the MMAVF. The patient tolerated treatment well and went on to make a good recovery as of last post-operative imaging at 8 months. Hence, MMAVFs may be present in the setting of IPH following a traumatic brain injury which warrants maintaining a high level of suspicion and low threshold for intervention as they can cause secondary spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. The absence of notable subdural or extradural hemorrhage on imaging should not exclude rupture. Transarterial embolization with an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer is an effective treatment modality.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2022.12.039,PMC9860176,"Arteriovenous; Fistula; IPH, intraparenchymal hemorrhage; MMAVF, middle meningeal arteriovenou fistula; Meningeal; Rupture; Spontaneous; TBI, traumatic brain injury; Traumatic",Case Reports,Netherlands,eng
32581499,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as a complication of bacterial meningitis.,"Christofidis, Ch; Anastasiou, A; Krasnikova, E; Mandros, Ch; Potolidis, E",Christofidis,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinical-radiological syndrome, which is presented with headache, seizures, altered mental consciousness, and visual disturbances, and is characterized by white matter vasogenic edema, predominantly affecting the posterior occipital and parietal lobes of the brain. This clinical syndrome is increasingly recognized due to the improvement and availability of brain imaging and, more specifically, magnetic resonance imaging. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 20-year-old female who presented with fever, headache, and generalized arthralgia, raising the suspicion of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serotype B meningitis, which was later complicated by PRES. The patient was treated with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, mannitol, and dexamethasone. Her mental status was completely restored in 3-4 days after the initiation of the treatment for PRES and was characterized by rapid clinical recovery. PRES is a neurotoxic state characterized by a unique brain imaging pattern typically associated with a number of complex clinical conditions including infection, sepsis, and shock.

32411562,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Masquerading as Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Filatov, Asia; Kassar, Emily; Cole, Oladipo",Filatov,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a hematologic disorder that results in widespread clotting due to a deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) protease. This leads to excessive von Willebrand factor (VWF) protein-platelet multimers. Due to platelet consumption, platelet levels fall, resulting in thrombocytopenia. We examined a case of a 31-year-old female with no significant medical history who presented with expressive aphasia and paresthesias and was sent to the Emergency Department for a stroke workup. Imaging was negative for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; however, a complete blood count (CBC) was consistent with anemia and thrombocytopenia, resulting in a high suspicion for TTP. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and given fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells. Plasma exchange therapy was initiated, and her aphasia and paresthesias began to improve. The ADAMTS13 level returned at less than 5%, which prompted the initiation of rituximab therapy. During her 36-day hospital stay, she continued to receive daily steroids and plasma exchange and a total of four courses of rituximab. Her platelets steadily climbed, and she was discharged with instructions to follow up with outpatient hematology. TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy that results in microscopic blood clots anywhere in the body, including the cerebral arteries. This results in the neurologic abnormalities that are often seen in TTP. Because TTP is a rare disease, treatment modalities are still scarce but include steroids, plasma exchange therapy, and rituximab. Novel therapies are on their way, one being caplacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits VWF from interaction with glycoprotein 1b. A concern highlighted by this case is the exclusion criteria for the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). As this patient presented with stroke symptoms and a negative head CT, TPA would have been administered had a CBC not returned showing evidence of TTP. This highlights the importance of strict adherence to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines that include ensuring that the platelet count is >100,000 prior to the initiation of TPA.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.7661,PMC7219015,adamst13; fatrn; stroke; thrombocytopenic purpura,Case Reports,United States,eng

We report the case of a 77-year-old female who presented with dizziness, visual hallucination, and a rapid decline in her mental state shortly after a right knee surgery. Brain MRI with contrast showed cortical and subcortical T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in bilateral posterior temporal lobes and the left occipital lobe without an associated enhancement, suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Workup including metabolic, infectious, and vasculitic panels were all within normal limits.

CCFs may pose diagnostic and management pitfalls for clinicians as they can initially be misdiagnosed as primary orbital pathology or nonarteriovenous shunting-related cavernous sinus pathology. Furthermore, the resolution of pulsatile tinnitus could be an ominous sign in patients with untreated dural arteriovenous fistula. We describe a case of a 56-year-old male who presented with progressive right eye proptosis, congestion, decreased visual acuity, limited duction, exophthalmos, and pulsatile tinnitus. The patient had poor response to antibiotics and steroids. Magnetic resonance imaging brain showed significant inflammation involving the right orbit and atypical enhancement of the basal frontal lobe adjacent to the orbit. Cerebral angiography revealed an indirect right CCF and right sigmoid sinus thrombosis with stenosis of the right internal jugular vein. No clear predisposing factor was identified. Given the rapidly progressive nature of the condition, the patient successfully underwent endovascular treatment with transvenous approach to preserve flow in the internal carotid artery while ensuring occlusion of the fistula. A triad of proptosis, eye congestion, and signs of turbulent flow such as tinnitus or orbital bruit should raise suspicion for CCF. An interesting feature in this patient is that CCF may have occurred secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis with accompanying small cortical vein drainage. Our case highlights the importance of early recognition and timely intervention to ensure the resolution of orbital hypertension-related symptoms in rare cases of CCFs.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain circulation,10.4103/bc.bc_64_22,PMC10158662,Carotid cavernous fistula; embolization; ophthalmoplegia,Case Reports,India,eng

An initial CT scan showed ill-defined hypodensity in the left internal capsule, which, when combined with the clinical features, suggested acute ischemic stroke. The patient received an IV tissue plasminogen activator within the recommended time window. Several days later, repeated imaging showed bilateral thalamic hypodensity consistent with subacute infarction in the territory of the artery of Percheron.

Our case is that of a 17-year-old girl who suffered multiple orthopedic injuries without intracranial trauma after being a pedestrian struck by a vehicle. Despite presenting with a normal Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), within 4 hours of presentation, she was noted to have an acute mental status change to a GCS 7 with a normal computed tomography brain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was suggestive of FES which, in this patient, had a rapidly progressing course with the development of severe cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension refractory to maximal medical therapy. Our patient required bilateral craniectomies for intracranial decompression and progressed over a 2-month hospital course to have subsequent cranioplasty and functional neurologic improvement.

We present the case of a 75-year-old woman, found prone in her home with AMS, who was unable to provide a history. As her hospital stay evolved, we were forced to consider the entire breadth of possible causes of AMS. Eventually, the patient was found to have cerebral venous thrombosis, the significant extent of which is rarely reported.

We aimed to evaluate PCT abnormalities in patients with acute epileptic seizures or status epilepticus (SE). We collected patients undergoing acute PCT for the suspicion of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), who received a final diagnosis of focal seizures or generalised seizures with a post-ictal deficit, with or without concomitant AIS. PCTs were retrospectively analysed for the presence of hyper- and hypoperfusion, and results correlated with delay from seizure onset, aetiology, type of seizures and the presence of electrical SE. Half of the 43 consecutively identified patients had regional PCT abnormalities-hyperperfusion in 13 (30%) and hypoperfusion in 8 (19%)-and 4 (9%) had AIS. Among patients with hyperperfusion, six (46%) had a focal deficit during imaging acquisition (two a normal clinical status, one altered consciousness and four ongoing seizure); nine (69%) of these patients had a SE; none had a stroke. All patients with hypoperfusion had focal neurological deficit; three (37%) of them a simultaneous ischemic stroke (in the remaining five, hypoperfusion was considered to be related to the seizure post-ictal phase). In the 22 with normal perfusion, 9 had a focal deficit (10 a normal clinical status, 2 altered consciousness and 1 ongoing seizure); 3 had a SE, and 1 had a stroke. Patients with SE featured a higher prevalence of hyperperfusion (9/13 [69%] vs. 4/30 [13%] without SE, p = 0.00). In patients with acute epileptic seizures, regional hyperperfusion on PCT may suggest an ongoing or recently resolved SE, whereas hypoperfusion may be due to post-ictal state or simultaneous AIS. These observations might help attributing focal deficits to epileptic seizures rather than stroke, allowing for targeted therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-018-9095-1,,Epilepsy; Perfusion imaging; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A retrospective search was conducted using the laboratory information system. Selected cases were reviewed, tumors were classified according to the 2007 World Health Organization Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, and tissue sections were submitted to an immunohistochemistry panel for further characterization. Affected cats were adults (average age 8 years), and male neutered (9/13) domestic shorthair cats (12/13) were over-represented. Clinical signs had acute onset and were progressive, lasting from 1-60 days (average course 20.7 days). Euthanasia was elected in all but one case, owing to a poor prognosis or because of a suspicion of rabies. Tumors occurred in the telencephalon (8/13), spinal cord (3/13) and brainstem (2/13). Gross changes in seven cases consisted of well- or poorly demarcated, gray-to-brown, soft, gelatinous masses that often caused secondary changes to the brain. The final diagnosis and classification were made based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Diagnoses consisted of oligodendroglioma (six cases), anaplastic astrocytoma (two cases), oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic ependymoma, gliomatosis cerebri, glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (one case each).

It is the most common vasculitis affecting adults older than 50, with an incidence of 20/100,000 and an average age of onset of 70. Typically, patients initially present with new-onset headaches, visual changes and disturbances, jaw claudication, arthralgias, and tender or swollen temporal or occipital arteries. Our patient is a 73-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with 10 days of bilateral headache radiating to the occipital area associated with fevers, persistent chills, generalized weakness, and a headache described as constant, dull, 9 out of 10 pain, and minor pain with neck flexion. Lab work revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient had tender palpation to his temples and due to a high suspicion of giant cell arteritis, he was started on high-dose steroids with rapid relief of his symptoms. Biopsy showed evidence of active non-granulomatous vasculitis and confirmed bilateral temporal arteritis within the context of the clinical setting. GCA patients are more likely to be women and typically present with unilateral headache (66% of GCA), jaw claudication (50%), fevers (50%), and transient visual loss (16-54%). Here, we describe a 73-year-old male with a past medical history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA), diabetes, and cancer that presented with 10 days of bilateral headaches and fevers. Unlike the usual presentation, our patient denied any vision and joint pain changes, and the temporal arteries were not stiff to palpation. This patient presentation is unique to previous reports in the limited display of symptoms and absence of the most commonly associated manifestations. Although his presentation supported GCA, the features of elevated ESR and CRP, headache, and fever were too general to diagnose GCA exclusively, and his additional symptoms of rhinorrhea and sinus pain more likely supported infection. Our case indicates the importance of maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion for GCA in the elderly population presenting with headaches and elevated ESR and CRP. GCA, also known as temporal arteritis (TA), is a systemic autoimmune inflammation of medium and large arteries. Typically, patients initially present with new-onset headaches, visual changes and disturbances, jaw claudication, arthralgias, and tender or swollen temporal or occipital arteries.

We present a case of a 72-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who presented to the emergency department with dysarthria and right hemiataxia. The initial computer tomography was normal and the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was first assumed. However, during hospitalization there was a progressive worsening of symptoms with cerebellar ataxia, and the magnetic resonance revealed a lesion in the right middle cerebellar peduncle hypointense in T1 and hyperintense on T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, suggestive of PML. Although the first cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative, the second one was positive for the JC virus. Furthermore, due to radiological and clinical progression, mirtazapine was started and the patient underwent a course of intravenous immunoglobulin, with no response. In parallel, causes of immunosuppression were investigated, which led to the diagnosis of idiopathic CD8+ lymphocytopenia. Due to rapid progression of symptoms and radiological worsening of lesions, pembrolizumab was administered. After the first administration of pembrolizumab there was a transitory clinical stabilization. However, shortly after the second administration of pembrolizumab, the patient developed stridor with bilateral vocal cord paralysis and subsequent symptom progression, which led to the death of the patient three months after the appearance of initial symptoms. In conclusion, we report a case of a PML in a patient with idiopathic CD8+ lymphocytopenia, enhancing the need for a high suspicion index for this entity as well as for occult and less frequent forms of immunosuppression.

The first case involved a 21-year-old man with HLA-B27 negative peripheral spondylarthritis who had been taking adalimumab for 2 years. He developed headache, urinary incontinence, and bilateral lower extremity numbness that progressed to the middle of the trunk for 2 days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple hyperintense enhancement lesions in the left paramedian anterior pons consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). The second case included a 17-year-old woman who was on 2 years of adalimumab treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and chronic anterior uveitis and developed new-onset dizziness and tremors. The clinical examination showed signs of cerebellar dysfunction. MRI findings were consistent with multiple sclerosis. The third case was a 34-year-old male who was on 5 years of infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis when he developed left hand numbness and weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and MRI findings were consistent with demyelination. Discontinuation of tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF-<i>α</i>) resulted in resolution of the symptoms with no recurrence in the first case, but there was evidence of recurrence in the other 2 cases, where one was managed with rituximab and the second one improved with pulse steroid therapy. Despite the small number of patients, our series adds to the growing body of evidence supporting a causal link between anti-TNF-<i>α</i> agents and demyelination. Thus, we can conclude that on suspicion of any neurological side effects, early discontinuation of the TNF-<i>α</i> blockers and requesting urgent MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis is of utmost importance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2022/3784938,PMC8920694,,Case Reports,United States,eng
38454893,Psychotic Disorder after Left Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke-An Atypical Event.,"Nascimento, Henrique; Almeida, Bárbara",Nascimento,"Stroke survivors usually present physical and neuropsychiatric complications. Post-stroke psychosis (PSPsy) is a particularly neglected sequel despite its disruptive nature. To present a case of early emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms following a left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. To review and discuss PSPsy clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and clinical outcomes. A previously autonomous 68-year-old woman with vascular risk factors and depressive disorder presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of disorientation, motor aphasia, and right hypoesthesia. Computer tomography revealed a left PCA stroke. She was started on acetylsalicylic acid and rosuvastatin and discharged the next day. Afterward, the patient developed a depressive mood, emotional lability, periods of confusion, delusions of persecution, guilt and unworthiness, auditory hallucinations, and suicide ideation. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and started on risperidone with a good response, being discharged after 15 days with the resolution of psychiatric symptoms. PSPsy is more common after right hemisphere lesions and usually develops after some months. Nevertheless, our patient presented PSPsy following an ischemic event of the left PCA, with neuropsychiatric symptomatology dominating the clinic since the beginning. The involvement of the retrosplenial cortex or its connections was likely important for this atypical presentation. Due to the lack of guidelines on approaching PSPsy, most patients are treated with the same strategies used for non-stroke patients. A better comprehension of the anatomical basis underlining the symptomatology in these patients could deepen the understanding of psychosis and psychotic disorders.",{},,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,,PMC10926015,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng

We report a rare case of acute brain injury resulting from RCVS after a packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. A 49-year-old female with a history of menorrhagia initially presented with generalized weakness. She was found to have a hemoglobin (Hgb) of 1.7 g/dL in the setting of a fundal fibroid for which she received five units of PRBCs. Post transfusion, she complained of several days of thunderclap headache and later returned with new-onset seizures. She was admitted to the neurocritical care unit for the treatment of status epilepticus. Metabolic, infectious and toxic work-up were unremarkable except for an elevated lactate. MRI of the brain with contrast showed extensive bilateral hemispheric and cerebellar white matter T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2/FLAIR) hyperintensities with areas of enhancement. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram was performed to evaluate for a vascular etiology and revealed focal segmental stenoses in bilateral A1 segments of the anterior cerebral arteries and in branches of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. These findings were suggestive of RCVS. Clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for RCVS in patients presenting with neurological manifestations, such as thunderclap headache or seizures after recent transfusion.

He had a rapid neurological decline, and a computed tomography (CT) head showed blurring of gray-white matter interfaces in the right posterior parietal lobe, suggesting infarction or PRES. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain suggested worsening with acute-early subacute infarction involving the right temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and diffuse cerebral edema causing compression of the right ventricle with diffuse sulcal effacement and central downward herniation. There were flair hyperintensities in the bifrontal, pons, and cerebellum. Given the history of uncontrolled hypertension, the right hemispheric infarction and edema were thought to be due to secondary complications of severe PRES. He underwent urgent bilateral craniectomies with dural augmentation and external ventricular drain placement to control the intracranial pressure the next day. His mental status, as well as neurologic function, showed gradual improvement in the next few months.

Clinically, it can have an acute to sub-acute onset of confusion and cognitive impairment, facial-brachial dystonic seizures (FDBS), and psychiatric disturbances. The clinical manifestations are varied, and its diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to avoid delay in the treatment. When patients manifest mostly psychiatric symptoms, the disease may not be immediately recognized. We aim to report a case of Anti-LGI 1 LE in which the patient presented acute psychotic symptoms and was initially diagnosed with unspecified psychosis. We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids and immunoglobulin and later with IV rituximab. In patients that predominantly present with psychotic and cognitive disorders the diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE can be delayed predisposing them to a poorer prognosis (permanent cognitive impairment - especially short-term memory loss - and persistent seizures). It is necessary to be aware of this diagnosis when evaluating acute to sub-acute psychiatric illness developing with cognitive impairment (specially with memory loss) to avoid diagnosis delays and long-term sequelae.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.36223,PMC10105494,anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 limbic encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; liaison psychiatry; limbic encephalitis; psychosis,Case Reports,United States,eng

They can be secondary to infections, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune diseases, or connective tissue diseases. Dissecting etiology is rare. A 60-day-old female infant, previously healthy, presented to the emergency department (ED) with irritability and loss of appetite since the preceding day, a fever of one-hour duration, and vomiting. Laboratory analysis revealed a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, without elevation of inflammatory markers. In the ED, she experienced two episodes, with a one-hour interval, of clonic movements of the upper eyelid and right upper limb, along with conjugate gaze deviation to the same side, which resolved after intravenous diazepam. Levetiracetam was initiated after the second episode. The anterior fontanelle became progressively tense. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed a voluminous intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with an aneurysm at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Initially, an endovascular approach was tried but was not successful due to technical problems. Consequently, a Vaso-CT scan was performed that confirmed a dissecting aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm (8 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm) of the left MCA, originating from the upper wall of the M1 segment. Next, she underwent microsurgical exclusion of the aneurysm using microclips. Post-surgery brain CT showed acute ischemia in the entire MCA region. Follow-up angiography showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm. She evolved to grade 3 monoparesis of the upper limb at the six-month interval follow-up, which has been gradually improving with physical rehabilitation. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for aneurysms and arterial dissections did not detect any pathogenic variants. Clinical presentation of cerebral aneurysms in infants can be subtle, and a high index of suspicion is required in cases of irritability, altered consciousness, seizures, bulging fontanelle, and motor deficits. Early detection is of utmost importance as it is associated with moderate mortality. Surgical treatment with the use of clips proved to be effective in this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.53442,PMC10909312,cerebral aneurysm; dissecting etiology; endovascular treatment; infant; surgical treatment,Case Reports,United States,eng

We report the case of a 14-year-old boy who presented with sudden onset headache and vomiting. CT angiogram pointed to the possibility of an IVA. This was confirmed by MRI with three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS-3D) sequences and digital subtraction angiography. The patient underwent microsurgical excision of the aneurysm and is doing well on follow-up. Idiopathic IVA can present with IVH at any age. MRI with CISS-3D and MR angiography would be the imaging modality of choice since it can also rule out other causes of intraventricular bleeding such as tumors and AVM. These lesions could be managed effectively by microsurgical excision/clipping.

Later, she suffered from oscillopsia and the symptom disturbed her daily life especially while driving. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor of approximately 30 mm in diameter at the dorsal midline of the posterior fossa. The tumor was compressing the cerebellar vermis and was apparently responsible for the symptoms that affected her daily life; therefore, we decided to perform tumor removal. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the spontaneous downbeat nystagmus completely disappeared. Vertical nystagmus is a finding that raises suspicion of a central nervous system disorder, and requires detailed examination.

Childhood ischemic stroke is attributed to vasculopathy with moyamoya syndrome. Hemorrhagic stroke is commonly attributed to aneurysms accompanying HbSS cerebral vasculopathy in SCD. However, a growing body of literature highlights multiple contributing factors to hemorrhagic stroke in children. Primary hemorrhagic stroke is one of the most devastating neurological complications of SCD. We describe the case of an 18-year-old female affected by HbSS genotype SCD presenting with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) as well as features of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after transfusion of red blood cells. We reviewed the existing literature dealing with SCD, blood transfusion, and hemorrhagic strokes. To our knowledge, this case presentation is unique with convexity SAH predominantly attributable to a RCVS spectrum disorder occurring in the setting of a recent blood transfusion in an adolescent female with SCD. As this case illustrates, neurological deterioration accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage in children and young adults with SCD after blood transfusion should raise suspicion for RCVS as part of a complex cerebral vasculopathy. A better understanding of the risk factors leading to hemorrhagic stroke may help prevent this severe complication in subjects with SCD.

One cat's signs progressed over 2 wk; the other cat progressed over 5 days. Examinations were consistent with a process involving the prosencephalon, vestibular system, and general proprioceptive/upper motor neuron systems. MRI of the brain and cervical spinal cord reveal widespread T2 hyperintensity of the white matter. Affected areas included the cerebrum, cerebral peduncles, corticospinal tracts of the pons and medulla, and the cerebellum. T2 hyperintensity was present in all funiculi of the spinal cord. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were consistent with cytotoxic or intramyelinic edema. Differential diagnosis included toxic or metabolic/degenerative leukoencephalopathies. Necropsies revealed widespread spongy degeneration of the central nervous system white matter. Toxicologic assays of liver specimens revealed desmethylbromethalin, a metabolite of bromethalin. Bromethalin is a rodenticide that causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Antemortem diagnosis is challenging. DWI and ADC maps were instrumental in narrowing the differential diagnosis and raised the index of suspicion for bromethalin. Bromethalin intoxication should be considered in all animals with a progressive course of multifocal neurologic deficits.

These tumors are usually diagnosed by conventional MRI, but this method is unable to describe the relationship between tumor and neighboring WM tracts. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) is a new imaging modality which can solve this problem. The current study evaluated the application of DTT imaging in the presurgical assessment of gliomas, and introduces this new modality and its importance to physicians and imaging centers in Iran. Ten patients with intra-axial brain tumor and suspicion of glioma underwent conventional brain MRI pulse sequences and DTT imaging between December 2011 and February 2013 with a 1.5 Tesla system using 64 independent diffusion encoding directions. Acquired images were assessed by the neuroradiologist and neurosurgeon. The treatment strategies were recognized and compared using data before and after the tractography. On the basis of DTT data, the treatment strategy changed from radiotherapy to the craniotomy in seven patients, and in one patient, the neurosurgeon preferred to avoid surgery. In one patient, the treatment technique did not change, and in the last one radiosurgery was replaced by craniotomy. As we can infer from this study, based on the tractography results, the treatment strategy may be changed, and the treatment technique could be devised more accurately and may lead to fewer postoperative neurological deficits and better outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,The neuroradiology journal,10.15274/NRJ-2014-10008,PMC4202843,brain glial tumor; diffusion tensor tractography; presurgical assessment,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Delays to diagnosis and definitive treatment herald a poor prognosis, with the development of catastrophic neurological injury or death secondary to cerebral air emboli. A high level of suspicion is essential to improve recognition of this rare but devastating condition. A 59-year-old man presented to the emergency department with an acute stroke and reduced consciousness. This presentation was preceded by an uncomplicated AF ablation 19 days prior and a subsequent emergency department attendance within a few days of his procedure, where he had presented with a history of new chest pain and reflux symptoms. Imaging revealed intra-cranial and intra-cardiac air, which was attributed to an uncontrolled atrio-esophageal fistula. Treatment options were limited by the patient's clinical instability and the patient was eventually palliated after developing catastrophic brain injury due to extensive cerebral air emboli. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Patients typically first present to the emergency department with new symptoms of either gastroesophageal reflux or chest pain, therefore, early recognition by emergency physicians is vital. Characteristic symptoms alongside a recent history of a cardiac ablation procedure should prompt additional diagnostic imaging to look for evidence of an atrio-esophageal fistula.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2020.07.019,,atrial fibrillation ablation; atrio-esophageal fistula; cerebral air embolism,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Guillain-Barré syndrome was confirmed and treatment initiated. She responded well to intravenous immunoglobulin treatment and then subsequently continued with rehabilitation. There have been a few case reports of GBS as a complication of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. It may not be a coincidence that our patient developed GBS shortly after presentation. There may be an immunological explanation with immune activation following neuronal injury after ICH with associated blood-brain barrier breakdown. GBS following ICH adds further complexity to treating patients who are already critically ill. If patients develop new weakness after ICH, there should be a high index of suspicion for GBS. It should be distinguished from critical illness neuropathy/myopathy and other causes of weakness in critical care patients because the treatment is very different.

A 74-year-old male presented to the hospital with fever and chills. He had also been evaluated by his PCP for changes in his mental status, trouble remembering things, and following directions while driving. A lumbar puncture was performed, and empiric meningitis coverage was initiated. His LP results were not suggestive for any infectious process. An MRI showed bilateral hippocampal edema. As an infectious workup was non-revealing and other causes were ruled out, with the concern for paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalitis, patient was started on high dose steroids and plasma exchange while results of antibodies for autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were awaited. After plasmapheresis and a course of steroids, the patient's mental status began to slowly improve. He was discharged from the hospital and on subsequent neurology office visit, his serum autoimmune encephalitis panel returned positive for anti-LGI 1 antibodies. Further management consisted of outpatient rituximab infusion. Diagnosis of limbic encephalitis can be challenging and can present with symptoms of limbic dysfunction.

It is crucial to investigate potential underlying causes of sudden neurological deficit in the Emergency Department (ED) to enhance better recognition and proper care. CASE REPORT A 63-year-old man presented to the ED with left-sided weakness and headache of a 2-week duration. Ischemic stroke was preliminarily diagnosis in the ED. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed an abnormality in the right parietal lobe. A chest X-ray showed right lung opacity, suggesting a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. Subsequently, malignancy was suspected. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions in the right temporal and right parietal region. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were ordered to identify the primary source of malignancy. Multiple nodules within the lungs and liver were found; a biopsy was taken from the nodules and sent to the Pathology Laboratory. Final impression made after the results was primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain and liver metastasis. The patient was referred to Palliative Care team by the Oncology team after malignancy workup to get the proper attention. CONCLUSIONS A hypodense area in CT/MRI with unilateral weakness and headache does not necessarily mean that there is an underlying stroke. However, it can represent brain metastasis.

The first patient, a 45-year-old woman developed a brain hematoma in the location of the encephalitic lesion on day 9 after the onset of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) that required surgical evacuation. The second patient, a 53-year-old woman was being treated for HSE; on day 8 after admission a temporal lobe hematoma with midline shift was disclosed due to persistent headache. Both patients survived but were left with sequelae. We conducted a PubMed/MEDLINE search from 1986 to April 2013 on this topic.

Clinical presentation of intracranial hemorrhage overlapped the encephalitic symptoms in two-thirds of the patients. Half of patients underwent surgery. Overall, mortality rate was low (5.2%), and half of patients fully recovered. Intracranial bleeding, although infrequent, can complicate the evolution of herpes simplex encephalitis and should be borne in mind since its presence may require neurosurgery.

Internal cerebral veins (ICVs) are vulnerable to injury during neurosurgical approaches to the pineal and thalamic regions. The occurrence of unilateral postoperative ICV thrombosis in children is extremely rare, with only 2 such cases reported thus far. A 15-year-old child presented to the emergency department with headache, persistent vomiting, and pronounced lethargy for 3 days. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed and showed a large solid-cystic mass at the pineal region, resulting in upstream hydrocephalus. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was elevated, and a diagnosis of germ cell tumor was made. Patient was started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with partial response on repeat imaging after 3 courses of chemotherapy. Decision was made to proceed with surgical resection of the residual tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed on postoperative day 1 showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion in the right cerebral deep white matter, giving rise to a ""string of pearls"" appearance. There is also absence of enhancement of the right ICV, suspicious for deep cerebral venous thrombosis. This was confirmed on subsequent computed tomography venogram. Our reported case adds to the limited literature on postoperative ICV thrombosis in children and describes a unique imaging phenotype of venous watershed infarcts.

Most patients with brainstem CMs present with a sudden onset of seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial nerve deficits, headache, or ataxia. Up to 20% to 50% of patients are asymptomatic, and their CMs are diagnosed incidentally on brain magnetic resonance imaging. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 42-year-old man with a brainstem cavernous hemangioma presenting with fever of unknown origin and mild headache without meningismus. The patient underwent a midline suboccipital craniectomy and removal of a ruptured brainstem cavernous hemangioma and the surrounding thrombus. Postoperatively, the patient developed left facial nerve palsy, left abducens nerve palsy, and xerostomia. Abducens palsy and xerostomia resolved spontaneously days after the operation. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient showed stable improvement with resolution of his neurological deficits. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, there is no reported case of a patient with a ruptured brainstem cavernoma presenting with fever of unknown origin as the main symptom. We assume that the minimal intraventricular hemorrhage triggered the hypothalamic thermoregulating mechanism. Thus, it would be useful for physicians to raise the suspicion of a ruptured brainstem cavernous malformation with further imaging evaluation when investigating fever of unknown origin.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.930437,PMC8165496,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
36593745,Global Transient Amnesia as the Predominant Symptom of Cardiac Myxoma: A Case Report.,"Shrestha, Pritee; Obholz, Jacob; Chang, Tiffany; Adio, Babajide",Shrestha,"BACKGROUND The most common neurological symptoms from cardiac myxoma-induced stroke include territories of middle cerebral arteries, rendering posterior stroke less common. Although transient global amnesia usually has a benign prognosis, amnesia in the setting of concerning cerebellar symptoms should raise the suspicion for posterior circulation involvement. These benign-appearing symptoms can be manifestations of an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA). This unusual presentation can delay workup for underlying pathology. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman presented to the local emergency department after an episode of global amnesia that lasted about 15 minutes and was associated with some dizziness. The patient also reported a history of chronic disequilibrium. The head CT scan was negative for any acute findings. A follow-up MRI of the brain demonstrated acute small lacunar infarcts within the left cerebellum and right parietal lobe. An echocardiogram was performed due to concern for the cardioembolic source, which revealed left atrial myxoma. She was transferred to a tertiary center for immediate surgical intervention due to the high risk of embolization associated with the condition. The patient subsequently underwent successful surgical excision of the lesion. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac myxoma, although a rare cause of posterior stroke, needs prompt intervention as it is associated with a high risk of systemic embolization, including recurrent CVA. Transient global amnesia is an atypical presentation of cardiac myxoma that can easily be overlooked, delaying timely diagnosis and prompt intervention. Early recognition and surgical resection are crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.938221,PMC9826667,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
31926563,Cerebral arterial air embolism secondary to iatrogenic left atrial-esophageal fistula: a case report.,"Zhang, Ping; Bian, Yi",Zhang,"Cerebral arterial air embolism is a life-threatening complication that can result in neurologic deficits or death. Sometimes it is iatrogenic, presented as a complication of invasive medical procedures. Here we describe a case of cerebral arterial air embolism secondary to iatrogenic left atrial-esophageal fistula, of which the diagnosis might be covered up by the complicated pathophysiologic changes. A 68-year-old man presented with unconsciousness hours after aphasia and right hemiplegia, accompanied with hematemesis and fever. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, treated by radiofrequency catheter ablation 1 month ago. Brain CT displayed massive air embolism in left hemisphere, as well as right parietal lobe. Chest CT demonstrated a focus of air in the left atrium, which highly suggested an atrial-esophageal fistula. The patient received high flow (6 L/min) oxygen therapy. Intravenous antibiotics including imipenem and vancomycin were administered together with crystalloid rehydration. Supportive therapies were given including intubation, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use. Because of the patient's unstable condition and poor prognosis, surgical repair was considered but not pursued. The patient presented a very fast deterioration of cardiac function and circulatory failure, and finally died from cardiac arrest. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for atrial-esophageal fistula for patients presenting with chest discomfort, new onset of stroke, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and development of sepsis as long as 50 days after the ablation for atrial fibrillation. Urgent CT can ultimately establish the diagnosis in most cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-1602-1,PMC6954529,Atrial fibrillation ablation; Atrial-esophageal fistula; Cerebral arterial air embolism; Iatrogenic,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Metabolic causes include hypothyroidism, hyperuremia, hypo/hyperglycemia, hypo/hypernatremia, and encephalopathy. The structural causes include tumors, brain hemorrhage, infection, and stroke. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which a patient presented with altered mental status from both metabolic (myxedema coma) and structural diseases (frontal meningioma) with vasogenic edema and midline shift. A 55-year-old female presented with progressive coma. The clinical features included bradycardia and hypothermia. The imaging demonstrated a large frontal meningioma with a significant midline shift with laboratory findings suggestive of severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma. Hypothyroidism was treated aggressively with intravenous T3 and T4 with close neurosurgical observation. Osmodiuretics and steroids were administered as temporizing agents prior to craniotomy. Craniotomy was successfully undertaken after using these appropriate pre-emptive measures. Management of concomitant metabolic encephalopathy and meningioma with vasogenic edema and impending herniation can be challenging. Correction of the encephalopathy is crucial to minimize perioperative morbidity and mortality. Awareness of metabolic causes of acute decompensation is critical for perioperative management, so a high index of clinical suspicion can make an important timely diagnosis for treatment initiation. Severely hypothyroid patients are sensitive to anesthetic agents and are at a high risk for perioperative complications. Prompt treatment prior to surgical intervention can help minimize perioperative complications.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/sni.sni_357_17,PMC5820833,Altered mental status; hypothyroidism; meningioma; myxedema coma; neoplasm,Case Reports,United States,eng

It is characterized by brisk progressive higher mental dysfunctions, headaches, seizures/epilepsy, and behavioral changes, and is highly responsive to immunosuppressive medications. To quickly and properly determine patients' management plans and prognoses, doctors are left with only CAA-ri-associated behavioral changes and seizures, in addition to a high index of suspicion of the correct diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman was presented to the emergency room (ER) with behavioral changes and seizures. Upon screening, the patient was found to have radiological evidence of asymmetrical cortical-subcortical white-matter lesions accompanied by multiple cerebral microbleeds in the background of the negative screening for infectious/neoplastic and paraneoplastic processes. After undergoing a brain biopsy, the diagnosis was confirmed to be amyloid deposition within the inflammatory vessel walls. The patient showed a dramatic improvement after methylprednisolone pulse therapy, plasma exchange, and rituximab maintenance. CONCLUSIONS We encourage and support brain biopsies to confirm highly suspicious CAA-ri atypical cases to initiate early treatment and achieve the best outcome without any further delays.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.933869,PMC8579063,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A female patient showed at the age of 18 an acute neurological disorder (with psychiatric symptoms, focal seizures, orofacial dyskinesias and hypoventilation requiring ventilatory support) clinically mimicking anti-NMDAR encephalitis. At that time specific laboratory tests were not available, CSF revealed oligoclonal bands and MRI was negative. The patient had full recovery after first line immunotherapy (i.v. steroids and immunoglobulins). Fifteen years later, at the age of 33, she was hospitalized with subacute right hemiparesis and MRI disclosed multiple T2 hyperintensities in the white matter, one of them in the left midbrain showing contrast enhancement. Serum and CSF NMDAR antibodies were positive while MOG and AQP4 antibodies were negative. Intravenous methylprednisolone led to complete recovery. This case report provides evidence of a long-term persistence of NMDAR antibodies even 15 years after the encephalitis and raises the suspicion of a possible causal relationship between NMDAR antibodies and demyelinating disorders in the form of multiple sclerosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-020-04729-3,,Clinical course; Encephalitis; NMDAR antibodies,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

A variety of different etiologies have been reported, but the underlying mechanism is thought to be failed cerebral autoregulation. To the best of our knowledge, we report the third known case of PRES in an adult receiving intermittent peritoneal dialysis (PD). A 23-year-old male receiving PD was brought to hospital after experiencing a generalized seizure. On presentation he was confused and hypertensive. An MRI brain was obtained and showed multiple regions of cortical and subcortical increased T2 signal, predominantly involving the posterior and paramedian parietal and occipital lobes with relative symmetry, reported as being consistent with PRES. A repeat MRI brain obtained three months later showed resolution of the previous findings. Due to having a large number of endothelium-disrupting risk factors, including hypertension, uremia, and medications known to disrupt the cerebrovascular endothelium, we suggest that those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving PD are at high risk of developing PRES. Furthermore, we surmise that PRES is likely more prevalent in the ESRD population but is under recognized. Physicians treating those with ESRD must have a high index of suspicion of PRES in patients presenting with neurological disturbances to assure timely diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMC nephrology,10.1186/1471-2369-15-10,PMC3893488,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

World Health Organization in 2007, described pituicytoma as a low-grade tumour (Grade I) in the taxonomy of CNS cancers. The tumour can frequently simulate a pituitary adenoma and is also linked with hormonal disorders. Distinguishing a pituitary adenoma from a pituicytoma can be challenging. We present a rare case report where an elderly female showed high levels of prolactin mainly due to mass effects along with diagnostic, imaging, and immunohistochemical characteristics of pituicytoma. A 50-year-old female known case of hypothyroidism, complained of headache associated with dizziness and blurry vision. Her prolactin levels were high which led to the suspicion of pituitary involvement and underwent MRI. The imaging study revealed a well-defined, completely suprasellar, homogenously enhancing mass lesion arising from the left lateral aspect of the pituitary infundibulum. The initial differential diagnosis from the imaging included an ectopic pituitary gland, adenoma, pituicytoma, or hypothalamic glioma. She underwent a right supra-orbital craniotomy for debulking of the pituitary stalk lesion. The histopathological diagnosis was pituicytoma, WHO grade I. The clinical manifestations are mostly depended upon the tumour mass and position. They typically present due to mass effects leading to hormonal disorders. The imaging studies are the backbone of the clinical diagnosis along with the histopathological findings. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for pituicytoma, with an exceptionally low recurrence rate (4.3 %) following complete removal. Pituicytomas are slow-growing, benign glial growths. It is challenging to diagnose before surgery as its clinical manifestations and imaging findings look like those of non-functional pituitary adenomas. The effective treatment for pituicytoma is gross total resection by the endoscopic method or transcranial technique.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,International journal of surgery case reports,10.1016/j.ijscr.2023.108348,PMC10248223,Craniotomy; Immunohistochemical studies; Low-grade glial tumors; Pituicytoma; Pituitary tumors,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

Common clinical manifestations of CPM include spastic quadriparesis, dysarthria, pseudobulbar palsy, and encephalopathy of various degrees; however, coma, ""locked-in"" syndrome, or death can occur in most severe cases. Rarely, CPM presents with neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as personality changes, acute psychosis, paranoia, hallucinations, or catatonia, typically associated with additional injury to the brain, described as extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM). We present a patient with primarily neuropsychiatric manifestations of CPM, in the absence of focal neurologic deficits or radiographic extrapontine involvement. A 51-year-old female without significant medical history presented with dizziness, frequent falls, diarrhea, generalized weakness, and weight loss. Physical examination showed no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory data showed severe hyponatremia, which was corrected rather rapidly. Subsequently, the patient developed symptoms of an acute psychotic illness. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unremarkable, although a repeat MRI two weeks later revealed changes compatible with CPM. This case demonstrates that acute psychosis might represent the main manifestation of CPM, especially in early stages of the disease, which should be taken into consideration when assessing patients with acute abnormalities of sodium metabolism.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2017/1471096,PMC5368399,,Case Reports,United States,eng

When the lesion is accompanied by edema, cerebral neoplasm usually leads to a differential diagnosis. This report presents a case of unilateral subcortical calcification and edema that resulted in cerebral hemorrhage and a subsequent diagnosis of an aggressive dural arteriovenous fistula. A man in his 60s presented with left hemianopsia and a progressive headache for over 6 months. Initial computed tomography revealed unilateral subcortical calcification and cerebral edema in the right occipital lobe, raising the suspicion of oligodendroglioma. However, 10 days later, a cerebral hemorrhage occurred in the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed flow void clusters and dilatation of the bilateral external carotid arteries and cortical veins, indicating a dural arteriovenous fistula. Cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a parasagittal dural arteriovenous fistula (Borden type III). The patient was successfully treated with trans-arterial embolization using Onyx. Thus, calcifications with edema are more commonly associated with cerebral neoplasms; however, in this case, they indicated the presence of a dural arteriovenous fistula with severe corticovenous reflux. The presented case highlights the importance of recognizing these imaging features in dural arteriovenous fistulas and raises awareness of the potential danger of early hemorrhage after diagnosis. Therefore, timely evaluation of cranial vessels is essential in cases of unilateral subcortical calcification and edema to facilitate the early detection and management of aggressive dural arteriovenous fistulas.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.08.097,PMC10514389,Brain Neoplasms; Brain edema; Calcification; Central nervous system vascular malformations; Interventional; Radiology,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

35217969,Cerebral venous thrombosis without thrombocytopenia after a single dose of COVID-19 (Ad26.COV2.S) vaccine injection: a case report.,"Di Pietro, Martina; Dono, Fedele; Consoli, Stefano; Evangelista, Giacomo; Pozzilli, Valeria; Calisi, Dario; Barbone, Filomena; Bonanni, Laura; Onofrj, Marco; De Angelis, Maria Vittoria; Sensi, Stefano L",Di Pietro,"The coronavirus pandemic became the hard challenge for the modern global health system. To date, vaccination is the best strategy against Sars-Cov-2-related illness. About 3 billions of people received at least one of the approved vaccines. The related adverse events were reported during the various experimental phases, but newer and less common side effects are emerging post-marketing. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (VITT) is one of these insidious adverse reactions and it is considered responsible of venous thrombosis, in both the splanchnic and the cerebral circulation. Although its mechanism has been presumably established, resembling that observed in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, some venous thromboses seem not to recognize this etiology and their pathogenesis remains unknown. Here we described a case of cerebral venous thrombosis after administration of the Ad26.COV2.S, presenting without thrombocytopenia, paving the way for possible novel causes of this vaccine-induced pathological condition. A 45-year-old woman came to our observation for bilateral periorbital headache associated with retro-orbital pain started 8 days after administration of COVID vaccine Jannsen. Ophthalmologic exam showing a bilateral papilledema raised the suspicion of intracranial hypertension. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed signal alteration with T1-positive contrast enhancement in the right temporal and insular lobes suggestive of cerebral venous thrombosis. The absence of thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) antibodies led the clinicians to rule out VITT. The patient was treated successfully with warfarin. Venous thrombosis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination represents an adverse event of special interest. Patients with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia appear to be affected by a general thrombophilic state, sustained by an autoimmune mechanism, and show a higher mortality. Thrombosis without thrombocytopenia's pathogenesis has not yet been clarified, but laboratory data and good response to vitamin K antagonists help clinicians in the differential diagnosis with VITT. Future research will allow us to discover other possible mechanisms and maybe identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of developing this medical complication.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-05965-5,PMC8880295,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2 infection; Stroke; Thrombosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

However, it is uncommon in the young population. The etiologies of stroke in young patients are different compared with those for the elderly population. They include various non-atherosclerotic angiopathies, hematological conditions, and inflammatory disorders. We report the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the emergency department because he noticed that his right hand had become clumsy. He first noticed this symptom five days before his presentation, but he noticed that his symptom had improved significantly since it began. He reported that he had episodes of neck pain and pain around the ear. He visited the family physician clinic several times for this complaint and was diagnosed as having a temporomandibular joint disorder. Neurological examination revealed decreased muscle strength in the right upper limb with a power of 4/5 along with a sensory deficit. The coordination was intact. No gait ataxia was noted. Considering the patient's age, the initial diagnosis was a demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. It demonstrated an increased signal intensity in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery representing a left-sided infarction. Subsequently, the patient underwent computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out any structural malformation. The scan showed the presence of an elongated styloid process that appeared in close proximity to the neck vasculature. These radiological findings are consistent with Eagle syndrome. The patient underwent surgical resection of the styloid process. Eagle syndrome is a rare clinical condition that may have a myriad of clinical presentations.

Diagnosis of Wallenberg syndrome is often overlooked as initial MRI may show no visible lesion. We present an atypical case of Wallenberg syndrome in which the initial MRI of the brain was normal. Our patient is a 65-year-old male who was brought in by emergency medical services complaining of right-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and left-sided weakness for one day. Physical examination showed decreased left arm and leg strength compared to the right side, decreased left facial temperature sensations, decreased left arm and leg temperature sensations, and difficulty sitting upright with an associated leaning towards the left side. An initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast revealed no abnormality. In light of such a high suspicion for stroke based on the patient's neurologic deficits, a repeat MRI of the brain was performed three days later and exposed a small focus of bright signal (hyperintensity) on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left posterior medulla. Wallenberg syndrome, also known as lateral medullary syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome, is a constellation of symptoms caused by posterior vascular accidents. The neurological deficits associated with this disease are due to damage of the lateral medulla, inferior cerebellar peduncle, nucleus of trigeminal nerve, nucleus and fibers of vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, descending sympathetic tract, spinothalamic tract, and/or vestibular nuclei. MRI with DWI is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis. Wallenberg syndrome has the potential to leave patients extremely debilitated.

Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion for idiopathic ICA vasospasm in similar clinical presentations and to explore more inclusive diagnostic criteria.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Brain circulation,10.4103/bc.bc_47_23,PMC10821686,Idiopathic carotid artery vasospasm; ischemic stroke; recurrent cerebral infarcts,Case Reports,India,eng

Despite the paucity of fever and respiratory symptoms, they remain capable of infecting others. The patient we discuss herein highlights the important issues of strokes as presenting events of COVID-19 infections, and how testing for COVID-19 in stroke patients, even when asymptomatic for COVID-19, can play an important role in infection control, clinical management and outcomes amidst this global pandemic. A 45-year-old male resident of a dormitory presented to our unit with acute vertigo and left-sided dysmetria. NIHSS was 2. The initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, middle cerebellar peduncle and hemipons. An extensive work-up for stroke etiologies was unremarkable. Despite having no fever, respiratory symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, he was isolated and screened for COVID-19 due to his epidemiologic risks, with multiple residents from his dormitory being recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Confirming our suspicion, his respiratory samples returned positive for COVID-19. His D-dimer levels returned normal. Thereafter, the patient underwent posterior decompression surgery due to worsening edema caused by the cerebellar infarct. He was started on antiplatelet therapy and recovered significantly a month from presentation with an modified Rankin Sore of 2. He remained without typical COVID-19 symptoms. Our patient's case clearly supports the screening for COVID-19 in stroke patients who are without COVID-19 symptoms, appreciating the significant value it adds to infection control, clinical management, and outcomes amidst this global pandemic.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000305,PMC8041490,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The clinical signs of neurosyphilis are very variable, as well as its radiological features, and it is a diagnostic challenge. Knowledge of clinical symptoms and correct laboratory diagnostics, combined with routine radiological examination and additional diagnostic tools, such as high-resolution, three-dimensional FLAIR sequence, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are key to making an accurate diagnosis of neurosyphilis. CASE REPORT We present the clinical case of a patient who presented a 1-year history of vague clinical symptoms and was misdiagnosed with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis. Initial head MRI revealed extensive cerebral white matter lesions with cortical contrast enhancement, mainly of anterior and medial parts of the left temporal lobe, as typically seen in HSV encephalitis. Empirical therapy with acyclovir was started until a diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed with laboratory findings. Later, the therapy was changed to penicillin G. The patient's condition improved after receiving targeted treatment. A control MRI scan was performed, and previously detected changes in the brain had decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS MRI is the imaging of choice to support the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Our findings suggest that neuroimaging can play an important role in indicating suspicion of syphilitic encephalitis. Enhancement of the anterior and medial parts of the temporal lobe is an atypical imaging finding, and it can simulate an infection with HSV. Early treatment is critical to a positive outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936127,PMC9251802,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In this study, we present a very rare case of a ruptured aneurysm of a choroidal branch of the PICA; the aneurysm was exposed by splitting the vermis and resected after proximal arterial ligation. We have also undertaken a thorough review of the literature on aneurysms in choroidal branches of the PICA, focusing on the clinical presentation, etiology, radiological findings, and surgical strategies. We found that the aneurysms in our patient and the aneurysms in seven published case reports were small, and frequently associated with vascular anomalies. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in the fourth ventricle was detected in all eight cases. The outcomes of surgical treatment were generally favorable, notwithstanding the high incidence of rebleeding after rupture of distal PICA aneurysms. The recognition of predominant fourth ventricular hemorrhage should raise the suspicion of the presence of an underlying aneurysm, and digital subtraction angiograms (DSAs) should be immediately obtained in order to detect small aneurysms of the choroidal branches of the PICA.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-009-0446-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Austria,eng

The authors present clinical, neuroradiological, serological, and neuropathological findings in a 60-year-old man with an extraaxial CPA glioblastoma arising from the proximal portion of cranial nerve VIII. The patient presented with progressive left-sided deafness and left-sided facial palsy lasting less than 2 months and progressive dysarthria and dysphagia lasting 2 weeks. Preoperative neuroimaging suggested the diagnosis of CPA meningioma with ""dural-tail"" sign and involvement of the internal auditory canal. Serological examination showed an increase in the malignant markers of ferritin and neuron-specific enolase, which suggested underlying malignancy. The tumor was subtotally removed, and it was confirmed to be completely separated from the brainstem and cerebellum. Cranial nerves VII and VIII were destroyed and sacrificed. Transient severe bradycardia occurred during surgery due to entrapment of the caudal cranial nerve complex by the tumor in such an infiltrative way. The neuropathological examination revealed a glioblastoma. The patient underwent no further treatment and died of cachexia 2 months postoperatively. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case of a primary glioblastoma in the CPA in an adult. A high index of suspicion along with reliance on clinical assessment, radiological findings, and serum detection of specific malignant markers is essential to diagnose such uncommon CPA lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2010.12.JNS10912,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe the clinical findings and laboratory results of a 43-year-old male with HIV infection and MS, and reviewed 11 more cases reported in the literature. The first episode of MS occurred either during or after the recognition of the HIV infection except in the few cases reported in 1989. There has been a very strong male predominance. Age at onset was between 30 and 40 years old. The most common clinical course was relapsing and remitting. Most of the cases had a normal CD4+ cell count, usually exceeding 500 cells/mm(3). Despite that CD4+ cell counts were invariable high, all the patients had multiple tests to rule out opportunistic infections and HIV-associated illness. The clinical suspicion of MS was only considered after ruling out other opportunistic infections and was supported with brain imaging showing multiple white matter evanescent lesions, the presence of black holes, and a high myelin basic protein titer in the CSF. MS is usually considered late in patients with HIV. A typical MS course with suggestive MRI lesions and absence of severe immune suppression should suggest the diagnosis. It is possible that as with other MS patients, earlier initiation of specific treatments for MS will prevent the high burden of the disease and disability in these patients, but stronger evidence for specific recommendations remains to be obtained.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of neurovirology,10.1007/s13365-011-0054-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Acute cerebellar syndrome may occur, which can be explained by the extremely high accumulation of the drug in the cerebellum. However, presentation mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome similar to our case has never been reported. Here, we describe a 68-year-old Thai male presenting with advanced-stage cecal adenocarcinoma, as well as symptoms and signs indicative of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. He received two doses of intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg 6 hours before his symptoms occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral white matter. Further evaluation showed that his thiamine level was extremely low. Thus, he was diagnosed with fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The concomitant fluorouracil-induced thiamine deficiency eventually leads to rapid depletion of thiamine and was considered a risk factor for fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy. Fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy is believed to be caused by insult causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown, but our finding suggests that thiamine deficiency plays a crucial role in fluorouracil-induced leukoencephalopathy.

In these cases, an organic affective disorder can be diagnosed. The authors present the case of a 59-year-old male patient who developed a severe depressive episode over approximately 6 months and was, therefore, admitted to the hospital. In retrospect, he reported that, at age 39, he suffered from self-limiting sensory disturbances and muscle weakness in both legs. The current magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed several conspicuous FLAIR-hyperintense supratentorial white matter lesions compatible with chronic inflammatory brain disease. Imaging of the spinal axis revealed no clear spinal lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses showed CSF-specific oligoclonal bands. Therefore, multiple sclerosis was diagnosed. Further CSF analyses, using tissue-based assays with indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain tissue, revealed a (peri-)nuclear signal and a strong neuritic signal of many neurons, especially on granule cells in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, as well as in the corpus callosum. Additionally, antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers of 1:12,800 and a lymphopenia were detected in blood tests. Further system clarification showed no suspicion of rheumatic or oncological disease. Anti-inflammatory treatment led to rapid and sustained improvement. The present patient suffered from a probable ""autoimmune depression"" in the context of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis with typical MRI and CSF pathologies, alongside mild concomitant latent systemic autoimmune process (with high-titer ANAs and lymphopenia) and unknown antineuronal antibodies. The case report illustrates that a depressive syndrome suggestive of primary idiopathic depressive disorder may be associated with an autoimmune brain involvement. The detection of such organic affective disorders is of high clinical relevance for affected patients, as it enables alternative and more causal treatment approaches.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00745,PMC7457046,autoantibody; autoimmune encephalitis; connective tissue disease; depression; multiple sclerosis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We present 2 patients, who after aneurysm coiling with PGLA coils, developed mild symptoms and extensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter changes. The first patient was a 46-year-old woman who underwent coiling of a 6.8 × 6.8 × 7.0-mm incidentally discovered basilar apex aneurysm. Approximately 1 month after her aneurysm coiling, she developed scintillating scotoma, and an MRI of her brain revealed bilateral white matter changes with punctate enhancement. The second patient, a 56-year-old woman, developed paresthesias and gait instability 1 month after retreatment of a ruptured 12 × 8-mm basilar tip aneurysm with stent assisted coiling. MRI of the brain also revealed bilateral white matter changes with punctate enhancement as well as an area of restricted diffusion in her pons. Both patients underwent aneurysm coiling with PGLA coils. An extensive clinical evaluation revealed no specific etiology. The patients' symptoms and MRI abnormalities improved spontaneously over a period of weeks. Conclusions: After extensive evaluation for alternate causes of disease, we hypothesize that the patients' symptoms and MRI findings, which were not all within the territory supplied by the coiled vessel, were due to an overexuberant inflammatory response related to the PGLA coils. These cases highlight the importance of heightened clinical suspicion of neurologic complaints in the subacute period after aneurysm coiling.

We describe a case and discuss the anatomical and physiological implications of this rare combination of symptoms. A 51-year-old woman presented with 3 days of ""feeling drunk"". She could further specify her symptoms as blurry vision, slurred speech, and gait instability. She had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her examination at presentation was remarkable only for marked somnolence. Over the next several hours she developed mild upgaze limitation and vertical nystagmus. Non-enhanced computed tomography of the brain was normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 5 mm acute infarct in the caudal midbrain. The first week the patient remained somnolent and manifested marked stuttering. The patient improved gradually with speech therapy. Strokes affecting the diencephalic-mesencephalic junction can manifest with stuttering. Defective projections of the reticular formation to the supplementary motor area, damaged extrapyramidal circuits, and/or aberrant propioceptive feedback due to involvement of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve are the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms. Somnolence can also be part of the presentation and is likely due to disruptions of sleep pathways subserved by the reticular activating system. The accurate diagnosis of these cases depends on careful clinical assessment and high index of suspicion for stroke, especially in lieu of preexisting vascular risk factors and lack of an alternative explanation such as toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.",{},,Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,,PMC3317294,Midbrain stroke; magnetic resonance imaging; reticular activating system; somnolence; stuttering,Case Reports,United States,eng

33454719,Pediatric Fulminant Cerebellitis Is Still a Fatal Disease that We Know Little About! Two Case Reports and a Literature Review.,"Alomani, Hakem; Arshad, Muhammad; Elzonfly, Mahmoud; Aldakhil, Ali Ahmad; Alharbi, Abdullah H; Alasqah, Abdulrahman; Alfheed, Bandar Rashed; Aldhalan, Hesham",Alomani,"BACKGROUND Acute cerebellitis is a rare inflammatory disease with a variable clinical course that ranges from self-limiting illness with a benign outcome to a fulminant process (known as fulminant cerebellitis) associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. It poses a unique challenge to the pediatric community due to its infrequent occurrence and variable presentation, which ultimately contribute to variation in treatment and variation in clinical outcome. This condition has received little attention, with scattered case reports and reviews in the literature and no clear consensus or guidelines for pediatricians to standardize the approach and management. CASE REPORT We report the cases of 2 previously healthy children diagnosed with fulminant cerebellitis. The clinical picture started with severe headache, irritability, and acute deterioration of consciousness level with the absence of cerebellar signs. There was radiological evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus and cerebellar tonsillar herniation in the context of the inflamed cerebellum. The 2 patients received timely standard medical and surgical management for acute cerebellitis in the form of neuroprotective measures, osmotherapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and CSF diversion. One patient received aggressive immunomodulatory therapy and had a better outcome compared with the other patient who received no immunomodulatory therapy and had a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS A high index suspicion and early aggressive intervention are the best tools for achieving optimal outcomes in fulminant cerebellitis in children, given the lack of classic cerebellar signs. In addition to CSF diversion and broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals, some patients may benefit from early immunomodulator therapy and posterior fossa decompressive craniotomy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.928370,PMC7816662,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The patient was 52-year-old woman who had relapsed leukemia with a remission duration of 7 months, and she received re-induction with consolidation, allogeneic HSCT. After 4 days of engraftment, she had headache with fever and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis presented increased intracerebral pressure, white blood cell counts with dominant neutrophils, elevated glucose and protein level. Brain imaging showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement with scattered miliary TB lesions suggesting disseminated TB disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in CSF and sputum anti-TB medication was started. She was IGRA positive before transplantation but did not receive treatment for LTBI prior or during the transplant. Unfortunately, she expired because of intracerebral hemorrhage. TB meningitis is a rare but important complication of HSCT as it can cause serious neurologic sequelae, even death. So in transplant recipients having high risk of TB reactivation, LTBI treatment is recommended before or along with transplantation. If latent TB is not treated, vigilant suspicion and early diagnosis of TB meningitis could improve the transplant outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,10.1111/tid.13482,PMC8244057,acute myeloid leukemia; meningitis; miliary TB; stem cell transplantation; tuberculosis,Case Reports,Denmark,eng

Here, we present the case of MIE in a patient treated with rectal, oral, and intravenous metronidazole. This is the first case of MIE reported after suppositories. A 16-year-old girl with Crohn's disease treated with mesalazine and exclusive enteral nutrition was operated on due to perianal fistulas and abscesses. She received oral metronidazole for 25 days and rectal metronidazole for 15 days as an adjuvant before surgery. Moreover, 2.5 g of intravenous metronidazole was administrated during the perioperative period. The second day after the surgery, symptoms of cerebellar syndrome appeared. She presented with an inability to coordinate balance and gait. Although she showed accurate verbal responses, her speech was slow, slurred, and scanning. The finger-nose test was positive. The T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed an increased symmetrical signal within the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum and in the corpus callosum. The changes were characterized by restricted diffusion. Based on the clinical picture and magnetic resonance imaging findings, MIE was diagnosed. Treatment with metronidazole was discontinued. The cumulative dose of metronidazole that she received for 29 days was 54 g: 38 g p.o., 13.5 g p.r., and 2.5 g i,v. The first symptoms appeared on the 28th day of antibiotic therapy after receiving 52 g of metronidazole. The neurological symptoms resolved after six days; however, three days after the resolution, paresthesia appeared in the distal phalanges of both feet and lasted for approximately two months.

Diagnosing NCC can be challenging, particularly among those who reside in areas with rare occurrence of NCC and atypical manifestation such as a solitary parenchymal lesion. We treated a patient whose initially was diagnosed with brain abcess and later, brain tumor, only finally revealed to be an NCC case. A 25-year old male suffered from multiple focal-to-bilateral tonic clonic seizures, was initially diagnosed as brain abscess. He was given antibiotics and anti-seizure medication but the seizure relapsed with a typical semiology. Physical examination demonstrated grade I papilledema, grade 4+ hemiparesis, and headache of vascular origin. Patient was suspected to have oligodendroglioma after underwent head MRI examination and subsequent tumor resection was performed. Pathological anatomy evaluation demonstrated multiple cystic segments containing larva of tapeworm, supporting a diagnosis of active NCC infection. After 14-day course of antheminthic treatment and resumed AED, patient was seizure-free and NCC was not found upon follow-up CT scan. NCC, with respect to clinical and radiological manifestations, can be protean. A high index of suspicion towards NCC should always be maintained, particularly among patients originated from endemic area.

In the literature, numerous CA cases following cerebral ischemia have been reported, but few met the criteria for a prompt diagnosis. The authors present the case of a 52-year-old woman with SAH caused by a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) saccular aneurysm who developed non-fluent aphasia characterized by reduced verbal output, word-finding disturbances and phonemic paraphasias in both oral and written language. 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT was also consistent with right parieto-temporal and frontoparietal ischemia with crossed cerebellar diaschisis on the right cerebellum. A diagnosis of CA was made. One year follow-up showed improvement in communication skills but persistent right fronto-temporo-parietal ischemia. Cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH symptomatology may vary from motor and sensory disturbances to cognitive disabilities. Aphasia developing after cerebral ischemia of the right hemisphere in a right-hand dominant patient following vasospasm may be a misleading symptom for the localization of the insult.

The incidence is unknown, but the condition has most frequently been reported in patients in their fifth to sixth decades. Usually, this condition is regarded as reversible, but permanent deficits and even death have been reported. A 66-year-old female patient undergoing metronidazole treatment for pleural empyema was admitted to our institution after her second episode of seizure. Over the course of 1 week after admittance, the patient developed several convulsive seizures along with progressive cerebellar dysfunction and cognitive impairment. MRI revealed bilateral, symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the pons and dentate nuclei. EEG, ECG, lumbar puncture, and blood samples were normal. The patient improved already 2-3 days after discontinuation of metronidazole and was discharged fully recovered after 17 days. Follow-up clinical assessment and MRI were unremarkable. Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy is a rare condition, and due to a general lack of awareness the diagnosis is often delayed. This condition should be considered in metronidazole-treated patients presenting with unprovoked seizures, myoclonus, cerebellar signs, and encephalopathy.

We describe a case of missed CVT diagnosis, due to low clinical suspicion and nonrecognition of anemia as a prothrombotic factor, especially during an ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. A recently proposed CVT clinical probability score can guide clinicians in pursuing further neurovascular imaging. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man, with treatment-naive UC, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with new-onset diffuse headache, 4 weeks of bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Initial ED laboratory studies revealed severe anemia and unremarkable non-contrast head CT. Two days later, the patient returned to the ED for worsening headache. Non-contrast head CT revealed a left temporal hypodensity. This was later confirmed as acute ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MR venogram revealed thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, leading to initiation of therapeutic subcutaneous anticoagulation. Repeat MRI, secondary to worsening headache, revealed the development of petechial hemorrhages within the core of venous ischemia in the left temporal lobe. Therapeutic anticoagulation, along with symptomatic management of UC, led to clinical stabilization. CONCLUSIONS CVT should be suspected in patients with UC, especially in the context of anemia, presenting with new-onset or worsening headaches. Recognizing anemia as a thrombogenic factor is crucial. Diagnosis of CVT is challenging due to non-focal symptoms and poorly correlating diagnostic tests. We endorse implementing the CVT clinical probability score into AHA/ASA CVT guidelines to enhance diagnostic accuracy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.932123,PMC8274363,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
33627294,Transient cortical blindness in fat embolism syndrome---a diagnostic enigma.,"Mirza, Kiyana; Acharya, Prashant Upendra; Austine, Jose",Mirza,"Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a serious life-threatening manifestation of the fat embolism phenomenon characterized by Bergman's triad of dyspnea, petechiae and mental confusion. While fat embolization into systemic circulation is common, FES occurs in a meagre 0.05%-3% of patients having isolated long bone fractures. Though visual symptoms are commonly attributed to fat embolism retinopathy and is a later occurrence, it may not always be the case. Cortical blindness has been seldom reported in association with FES, and less so as a presenting complaint. Furthermore, no previous literature has described the same in context of an isolated tibia fracture. We report a 20-year-old gentleman with an isolated right tibia shaft fracture who developed sudden onset diminution of vision in both eyes less than 24 h following trauma with no other complaints. Lack of any remarkable ophthalmoscopic findings or other symptoms left us with a diagnostic conundrum. He later went on to develop altered mentation, hypoxia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures with subsequent MRI revealing multiple cerebral fat emboli also involving both occipital lobes. Supportive measures were instituted and his general condition as well as vision gradually improved following which he underwent plate fixation of the fracture under spinal anaesthesia. The perioperative period was uneventful and he was discharged following staple removal. At one month of follow-up, the patient had no residual visual field defects or neurological deficits. Though FES is rare among isolated tibia fractures, this clinical catastrophe may strike in any unsuspected setting thereby warranting a high index of suspicion to ensure early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi,10.1016/j.cjtee.2021.02.005,PMC8071712,Bone fractures; Cortical blindness; Fat embolism,Case Reports,China,eng

Choroid plexus metastasis from breast cancer is infrequent despite a high incidence of brain parenchymal metastasis. We report a case of solitary metastasis to the choroid plexus from a TNBC that masqueraded as central neurocytoma, and we review the PubMed database for similar cases focusing on their diagnostic challenges and management strategies. A 28-year-old woman with a history of TNBC presented with recurrent seizures, headache, and vomiting. Imaging studies depicted a well-defined lesion in the right anterior lateral ventricle that was attached to the septum pellucidum. After an initial radiological diagnosis of central neurocytoma, she deteriorated rapidly with intraventricular hemorrhage requiring emergency transcallosal microsurgical tumor decompression. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry confirmed breast carcinoma as the origin of the intraventricular mass. A review of the PubMed database identified only 2 case reports of choroid plexus metastases from breast cancer reported thus far. Choroid plexus metastases are exceedingly infrequent and can be mistaken for the more common central neurocytoma. The intraventricular milieu is inhospitable suggesting some extracranial carcinomas develop traits that help them to thrive in the acellular cerebrospinal fluid. Intraventricular mass lesions with a history of primary neoplasm should raise suspicion for choroid plexus metastases. A high index of suspicion despite excellent control of the primary tumor and the absence of systemic metastases is indispensable.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.12.066,,Brain metastases; Choroid plexus metastases; Hydrocephalus; Intraventricular metastases; Metaplastic breast carcinoma; Triple-negative breast cancer,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Generally pulmonary embolism (PE) is most common between the fifth and seventh days following a significant trauma, and it is uncommon before the fourth day. Their management remains a challenge to physicians given the nature and risk of blood loss from the accompanying injuries must be considered while using anticoagulant therapy. Here we present a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a previously healthy young woman that developed two days after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and varying degrees of additional blunt thoracic trauma. An angio CT scan was used to make the diagnosis, and the patient was given anticoagulant medication with close monitoring and satisfactory outcomes. Evidence suggests that early after trauma, a considerable number of trauma patients are hypercoagulable. In patients with unexplained dyspnea/hypoxia, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and explore PE early after injury. In the case of traumatic brain injury patients with cerebral contusions, intraparenchymal haemorrhages, or subdural/extradural haemorrhages, the existence of post-traumatic PE adds to the problems.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103868,PMC9207082,"Anticoagulation therapy; DVT, Deep venous thromboembolism; ICU, Intensive care unit; PE, Pulmonary embolism; Polytrauma; Pulmonary embolism; TAC, Therapeutic anticoagulation; TBI, Traumatic brain injuries; VTE, Venous thromboembolism; Venous thromboembolism",Case Reports,England,eng

The exact etiology of MERS is unknown, although infections and antiepileptic drugs have been reported as potential causes. Herein, we present the case of a 56-year-old male patient who experienced fever and headache for 3 days. He was referred to our hospital after symptomatic treatment by his primary care physician failed to improve his symptoms. The patient had no psychiatric symptoms or significant neurological findings. Head MRI revealed a high signal on SCC on diffusion-weighted imaging, raising the suspicion of MERS. All examinations to determine the cause of MERS were negative. The patient's symptoms improved with antibiotics and B complex vitamins. Upon admission, abdominal CT incidentally revealed a well-defined mass on the dorsal surface of the rectum suspected to be a tailgut cyst, warranting surgical resection. The cranial margin of the tumor was caudal to the third sacrum, and a trans-sacral approach was used for resection. The fifth sacrum and the coccyx were resected, and the tumor was resected without damaging the rectum. A histopathological examination revealed a mature teratoma without any malignancy. A follow-up CT at four months postoperatively showed no evidence of clinical recurrence of MERS. Adult-onset MERS is relatively rare, and no association with tumors has been reported. The association between encephalitis and teratomas includes ovarian teratomas, which cause anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Although the cause of MERS was unknown in this case, we report the coexistence of a sacral teratoma and MERS to contribute to the knowledge of the association between them.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.62574,PMC11255537,ciliated columnar epithelium; corpus callosum; cystic lesions; encephalitis; keratides; mers; reversible splenial lesion; sacrococcygeal teratoma; splenium; teratoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Especially when the patient's medical history is incompatible with MS, the differential diagnosis between these lesions constitutes a diagnostic challenge often requiring histological investigation. An older age at onset makes distinguishing tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) from tumors even more challenging. We report a case of brain TDL as the initial manifestation of late-onset MS associated with cervico-dorsal syringomyelia. A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a 15-day history headache was referred to our hospital because of the acute onset of paraphasia. She suffered from noncommunicating syringomyelia associated to basilar impression and she reported a 10-year history of burning dysesthesia of the left side of the chest extended to the internipple line level. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations revealed a left frontal lesion with features suspicious for a tumor. Given the degree of overlap with other pathologic processes, CT and MRI findings failed to provide an unambiguous diagnosis; furthermore, because of the negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal bands, the absence of other lesions, and the heightened suspicion of neoplasia, the clinicians opted to perform a stereotactic biopsy. Brain specimen analysis did not exclude the possibility of perilesional reactive gliosis and the patient, receiving anitiedemigen therapy, was monthly followed up. In the meanwhile, the second histological opinion of the brain specimen described the absence of pleomorphic glial cells indicating a tumor. These findings were interpreted as destructive inflammatory demyelinating disease and according to the evolution of MRI lesion burden, MS was diagnosed. TDL still remains a problematic entity clinically, radiologically, and sometimes even pathologically. A staged follow-up is necessary, and in our case, it revealed to be the most important attitude to define the nature of the lesion, confirming the classic MS diagnostic criteria of disseminate lesions in time and space.

It involves a stroke in the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery of the brainstem. In this case report, we critically examine the case of a 66-year-old man with newly diagnosed diabetes whose main presentation was dysphagia and unsteady gait. There was no motor or sensory examination finding in our patient, and the initial computed tomography of the brain was negative for any intracranial pathology leading to very low suspicion of stroke. However, given a high index of suspicion and a thorough oropharyngeal examination ruling out structural abnormality, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed features suggestive of Wallenberg's syndrome.

Cancer patients are at high risk of this acute encephalopathy due to chronic malnutrition, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and consumption of thiamine by rapidly growing tumors. A high index of suspicion is important as these critically ill patients may not present with the classic triad of symptoms. This study is a retrospective review of 5 patients with WE identified at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex., USA. Detailed clinical histories, risk factors, imaging, and histopathological characteristics are described. Five WE patients were identified and all patients had rapidly growing cancers and were undergoing active treatment. All patients had poor nutritional status due to chronic nausea from chemotherapy. Three patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Acute confusion was the most common symptom. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain revealed restricted diffusion and fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence hyperintensity in the medial thalami and periaqueductal gray matter. In 2 cases, WE was considered antemortem, and only 1 was empirically treated with thiamine, which rapidly reversed the imaging findings within 7 days and led to clinical improvement. Other cases were diagnosed at autopsy. It is crucial to consider WE in the differential diagnosis for all cancer patients with confusion. Cancer patients with malnutrition and patients with BMT are at high risk of developing WE. To prevent this devastating and often fatal neurologic complication, all cancer patients with confusion should be empirically treated with thiamine.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Oncology,10.1159/000174951,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

A 77-year-old woman presented with the sudden onset of severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage, predominantly in the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus with a thin subarachinoid hemorrhage (SAH). Angiography revealed an aneurysm arising at the turning point of the vessel, from the telovelotonsillar segment of the right PICA. On the 17th day after the onset, repeated angiography revealed a smaller aneurysm than the one detected on the first day at the same place and with no spasm. On the 22nd day, the aneurysm was proved to be partially thrombosed and was safely clipped via a right lateral suboccipital approach. SAH with a fourth ventricular hemorrhage or an isolated fourth ventricle hemorrhage should raise the suspicion of a distal PICA aneurysm. Aneurysms of the distal PICA have often been reported to arise at a turning point of the artery rather than at a junction of the vessel. It is suggested that the pathogenesis could be hemodynamic stress that has developed due to embryological factors. Distal PICA aneurysms have often gone detected in many previous cases because of thrombosis inside the aneurysms.

Though the presented tumors showed very similar appearance on conventional MR images, they differed significantly in perfusion examinations. The article draws special attention to the usefulness of PWI in the differentiation of various extra-axial tumors and its contribution in reaching final correct diagnoses. Finding a dural lesion with low perfusion parameters strongly argues against the diagnosis of meningioma and should raise a suspicion of a dural metastasis. In cases of CPA tumors, a lesion with low relative cerebral blood volume values should be suspected to be schwannoma, allowing exclusion of meningioma to be made. In intraventricular tumors arising from choroid plexus, low perfusion parameters can exclude a diagnosis of meningioma. In our opinion, PWI as an easy and quick to perform functional technique should be incorporated into the MR protocol of all intracranial tumors including extra-axial neoplasms.",{},,Journal of neuro-oncology,10.1007/s11060-010-0445-9,PMC3116130,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

This raised a strong suspicion of a coexisting abscess within a malignant glioma, which was confirmed by histopathologic and microbiologic examination. It is important for neurosurgeons to be aware of this rare entity. The treatment protocol remains controversial and is primarily guided by expert opinion.

The lesion enhanced on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, as well as on follow-up MRI. Subsequent vascular studies and metastatic work up were negative. A craniotomy with image guidance was performed and an intraoperative diagnosis was made of a thrombosed aneurysm along a branch of the middle cerebral artery. The aneurysm was trapped and resected as there was no significant flow from the branch as seen on the prior cerebral angiogram. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Completely thrombosed, nongiant aneurysms can mimic an intra-axial neoplasm. Typical imaging features for thrombosed aneurysms may be missed, especially if the aneurysms are small, where imaging characteristics of the intraluminal contents is more difficult to appreciate. Although imaging may be consistent with a neoplastic lesion, there should be suspicion for a potential underlying aneurysm.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/2152-7806.164696,PMC4571614,Complete thrombosis; middle cerebral artery; neoplasm; seizures; thrombosed cerebral aneurysm,Case Reports,United States,eng
30443447,Artery of Percheron Infarct: An Acute Diagnostic Challenge with a Spectrum of Clinical Presentations.,"Khanni, Javed L; Casale, Joel A; Koek, Adriana Y; Espinosa Del Pozo, Patricio H; Espinosa, Patricio S",Khanni,"The artery of Percheron (AOP) is a variant of the paramedian thalamic vasculature that supplies blood to the medial aspect of the thalamus and the rostral midbrain. The presentation of an infarct in this territory varies widely and is often characterized by nonspecific neurological deficits, with altered mental status, decreased level of consciousness, and memory impairment being among the most common. AOP infarcts are often missed on initial computed tomography (CT) scan, and additional imaging is usually not done due to low suspicion for stroke in most cases. There have been an increasing number of reports of AOP infarction, illustrating the diversity of clinical presentations and the challenge this presents to clinicians in the acute setting. Lacking the classic signs of stroke, many of these patients experience a delay in recognition and treatment, with the majority of diagnoses occurring outside the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) window. This case highlights the unusual presentation and diagnostic difficulty of a patient with an AOP infarct, and serves as a reminder to include thalamic pathology in patients presenting with vague neurological symptoms and no obvious signs of stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.3276,PMC6235647,artery of percheron; bilateral thalamic infarct; ischemic stroke; paramedian thalamic infarct; stroke; thalamic infarct; thalamic vasculature; thalamus,Case Reports,United States,eng

She developed multiple lung and bone metastases and was started on chemotherapy with bevacizumab and paclitaxel 3 years later. After 6 months of chemotherapy, she developed a decline in conversation and memory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted and showed multiple cortical and subcortical lesions and nodules with restricted diffusion but with no contrast enhancement on gadolinium (Gd) enhanced T1-weighted image, raising a suspicion of Trousseau's syndrome. A follow-up MRI revealed unchanged signal intensity of the lesions but with minimal enlargement. The cerebrospinal fluid cytology was negative for malignancy. Consequently, an open biopsy of the cortical lesion was conducted. Histopathology showed that the tumor cells were morphologically similar to the primary breast cancer extending from the brain surface along the Virchow-Robin spaces, which yielded a diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from breast cancer. Contrast enhancement on Gd-MRI may be impaired in case of tumor spread along the perivascular space or in patients treated with bevacizumab.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2024.04.041,PMC11103358,Breast cancer; Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; Virchow-Robin space,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

Complications of PN can be metabolic and thrombotic. Blindness is a rare and unexpected complication. A young female patient with postcorrosive pyloric stenosis was started on PN through an indwelling central venous catheter. On the sixth day of PN, the patient reported sudden painless bilateral complete loss of vision. Examination revealed bilateral normal-sized pupils with normal pupillary reaction. There was complete bilateral absence of visual acuity with no perception of light. Fundus examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute infarct in the left occipital lobe, left corpus callosum, and posteromedial aspect of the left thalamus. No cardiac source of the thrombus could be identified. After supportive treatment, the vision started improving after 3 days; recovery was 95% after 10 days. A feeding jejunostomy was performed urgently under local anesthesia, and 1 month of enteral nutrition was administered. One month after the event, the patient's vision returned to normal. Definitive surgery in the form of antrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction was performed 8 weeks later. Blindness secondary to central venous catheterization is very rare; possible mechanisms are venous thrombosis with paradoxical emboli, air emboli, or accidental arterial puncture.

28892315,[Which psychiatric symptoms must raise suspicion about a possible brain tumor ?].,"Mardaga, S; Al Bassir, M; Bracke, J; Dutilleux, A; Born, J D",Mardaga,"Many case studies reported psychiatric symptoms during the months before a brain tumor (BT) is diagnosed. Unfortunately, these symptoms are rarely considered as a warning of an organic problem and patients are regularly misoriented towards psychiatric care. Knowing better what psychiatric symptoms look like in patients with a BT would help to diagnose it sooner, which would obviously benefit the patient. The present study aims to quantify the prevalence and further describe psychiatric symptoms occurring before a BT diagnosis. The presence of psychiatric manifestations was systematically investigated in 100 patients with a first diagnosis of BT. Overall, 85 % of the patients reported at least one psychiatric symptom present before the BT diagnosis, most often depressive ones. Somatic manifestations of depression (loss of energy, changes in appetite...) were more often reported than affective or cognitive ones (no negative thought content: no pessimism, no guilty feelings, no worthlessness…). The present research stresses the high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, especially depressive-like ones, occurring before a BT is diagnosed and provides a first description of these symptoms, as a basis of practical recommendations.",{},,Revue medicale de Liege,,,Depression; Brain tumor – Psychiatric symptoms,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Belgium,fre

We report a series of 6 patients with histologically proven cavernoma, presenting with early clinical signs and radiological proof of rebleeding, that is occurring in the first month after initial overt haemorrhage. These 6 cases have been selected from a series of 142 patients seen between 1980 and 1995 in our department with cavernous angiomas or so-called AOVMs, of whom 93 presented with clinical symptoms of haemorrhage (34 patients presented symptoms of one or more rebleeding, but only 6 had radiological proof). All patients suffered neurological worsening due to the rebleeding, with an increase of the size of the haematoma on the CT scan. Five MRIs were performed at the acute stage: 3 showed evidence of cavernoma (60%). All patients underwent surgery at the acute stage of the rebleeding, with 5 improvements and 1 stabilization. A cavernous angioma was found in 5 cases at first surgery, but a further operation was necessary in the last patient to find and remove the cavernoma, after a second rebleeding following the first intervention. Our series reveals a high frequency of rebleeding after a first intracranial haemorrhage from a cavernous angioma, and highlights the precocity of such rebleedings. Therefore, we advocate early aggressive surgical management: in cases of cavernoma revealed by a first clinical overt haemorrhage, when there is strong radiological suspicion at the acute stage; and in all cases of rebleeding, even without radiological evidence of malformation, in the absence of vascular risk factors. Surgical indication must be discussed in particular cases of cavernomas of the brain stem when neither the haematoma nor the cavernoma reach the surface, and in deep supratentorial cavernomas, when the neurological status is good, because of the therapeutic risk.",{},,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/BF01411299,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Austria,eng

Agrypnia excitata (AE) is a rare syndrome characterized by sleep-wake cycle disruption, autonomic hyperactivation and episodes of oneiric stupor. Only a few diseases are known to present with AE. An autoimmune etiology must be considered when accompanied by neuromyotonia. A case of anti-LGI1 encephalitis presenting with AE is reported. Detailed clinical, video-polysomnographic, laboratory, radiological and long-term follow-up assessments were performed. A previously healthy 58-year-old man was referred for a rapidly progressive change in mental status, characterized by persistent drowsiness and confusion, accompanied by frequent episodes of unconscious gestures ranging from simple stereotyped movements to more complex actions mimicking various daily activities. Other symptoms included tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, mild hyponatremia, rare faciobrachial dystonic seizures, and a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, but no neuromyotonia. Prolonged video-polysomnography excluded epileptic activity and showed continuous monomorphic slowing of background activity not consistent with a regular wakefulness or sleep state. A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan was unremarkable. Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed hypermetabolism of the hippocampi, amygdala and basal ganglia. Anti-LGI1 antibodies were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. The sleep disorder resolved progressively after starting immunotherapy. Agrypnia excitata can be a dominant, treatable manifestation of anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Oneiric stupor episodes are a useful clinical feature for establishing diagnostic suspicion and could provide a window to understanding the mechanisms behind some movement disorders in autoimmune encephalitis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,European journal of neurology,10.1111/ene.15152,,electroencephalography; immunotherapy; limbic encephalitis; positron emission tomography; sleep initiation and maintenance disorders,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
26839779,Central nervous system infections masquerading as cerebrovascular accidents: Case series and review of literature.,"Hayes, Lisa; Malhotra, Prashant",Hayes,"Central nervous system (CNS) infections can have various presentations including Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) which may go unrecognized as a presentation of infection. We describe three cases of different CNS infections complicated by CVA. Case 1 describes a 27-year-old man, presenting with symptoms consistent with a transient ischemic attack found to have racemose neurocysticercosis. Case 2 describes a 55-year-old man with low grade fevers for 4 weeks accompanied by visual and gait disturbances and delayed speech diagnosed with multiple small left thalamocapsular and superior cerebellar infarcts secondary to cryptococcal meningitis. The third case describes a man with pneumococcal meningitis complicated by cerebellar infarcts. CNS vascular compromise secondary to infections may be due to vasculitis, an immune-mediated parainfectious process causing vasospasm or thrombosis, or a hypercoagulable state with endothelial dysfunction. Patients with CVAs are at risk for aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections (especially catheter related) and other nosocomial infections and their clinical presentation may be very similar to CNS infections. The cases described demonstrate that CNS infections need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of CVAs presenting with fevers. The signs and symptoms of non-CNS infections associated with CVAs may be clinically indistinguishable from those of CNS infections. The outcomes of untreated CNS infections are extremely poor. It is thus imperative to have a high index of suspicion for CNS infection when evaluating CVAs with fevers or other signs of infection.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,IDCases,10.1016/j.idcr.2014.10.005,PMC4735078,CNS; Cerebrovascular; Cryptococcus; Infections; Neurocysticercosis,Journal Article; Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

Treatment with edaravone, argatroban and heparin was ineffective for opening the middle cerebral artery and serious after effects occurred. This case suggests that cerebrovascular accident should be suspected in a young patient with disturbance of consciousness but stable breathing and circulation, particularly if previous drug treatment has affected brain circulation.

Due to the lack of desmopressin availability in our country, we managed the patient using indapamide. Polydipsia and polyuria in a patient with controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) should raise suspicion for alternative etiologies, including DI. Appropriate fluid management during hospitalization is critical to avoid life-threatening complications. TBI is an important cause of central DI and should be treated with desmopressin, an arginine-vasopressin (AVP) analog.

To date, there have been six cases of glioblastoma reported to exhibit such changes. Lesion transformation on repeat imaging after the initiation of steroids represents a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians when attempting to differentiate between a diagnosis of glioblastoma and lymphoma. Stereotactic biopsy may be inadvertently postponed due to high clinical suspicion for steroid-induced cytotoxicity traditionally seen with lymphomatous cells.

CT showed an irregular high-density area in the left temporal pole, which was diagnosed as a traumatic contusion.

The MRI showed the lesion as mixed signal intensity, suggesting both solid and cystic components. Subtotal resection was performed, except for the tumor adhering to the peripheral middle cerebral arteries(MCAs). The definitive diagnosis was made based on pathological findings and no evidence of extracranial lesions. Gamma knife surgery was performed for the remnant tumor adjacent to MCAs. The radiologically positive tumor chronologically regressed, and the patient remained progression-free for 18 months. Radiological findings of PIMM vary but typically include high density on CT and hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI. Close observation enabled early diagnosis based on the suspicion of a neoplasm according to atypical radiological findings.

After removal of the quad-lumen bolt and external ventricular drain on separate days, both follow-up computed tomography scans showed new hematomas in the devices' tracts, with significant intraventricular hemorrhage. Repeat PFAs were abnormally prolonged, representing a distinct change from baseline. A trend toward normalization of PFAs was observed 6 hours after discontinuation of piperacillin-tazobactam with progression toward baseline thereafter. This is unique in that the significant bleeding that occurred was attributable to platelet dysfunction rather than thrombocytopenia.

Our purpose was to ascertain the value of these techniques in the prediction of ischemic injury and estimation of infarction size, as determined on follow-up examinations. We studied 18 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent echo-planar perfusion and diffusion imaging within 72 hours of symptom onset. Quantitative volume measurements of ischemic lesions were derived from relative mean transit time (rMTT) maps, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps, and/or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Follow-up examinations were performed to verify clinical suspicion of infarction and to calculate the true infarction size. Twenty-five ischemic lesions were detected during the acute phase, and 14 of these were confirmed as infarcts on follow-up images. Both ADC and rMTT maps had a higher sensitivity (86%) than the rCBV map (79%), and the rCBV map had the highest specificity (91%) for detection of infarction as judged on follow-up images. The rMTT and ADC maps tended to overestimate infarction size (by 282% and 182%, respectively), whereas the rCBV map appeared to be more precise (117%). Significant differences were found between ADC and rMTT maps, and between rCBV and rMTT maps. Our data indicate that all three techniques are sensitive in detecting early ischemic injury within 72 hours of symptom onset but tend to overestimate the true infarction size. The best methods for detecting ischemic injury and for estimating infarction size appear to be the ADC map and the rCBV map, respectively, and the diffusion abnormality may indicate early changes of both reversible and irreversible ischemia.",{},,AJNR.

37206102,Cardiogenic shock due to reverse takotsubo syndrome triggered by multiple sclerosis brainstem lesions: a case report and mini review.,"Brandner, Joas; Lu, Henri; Muller, Olivier; Eskioglou, Elissavet; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Antiochos, Panagiotis; Chocron, Yaniv",Brandner,"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is mainly characterized by chest pain, left ventricular dysfunction, ST-segment deviation on electrocardiogram (ECG) and elevated troponins in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Diagnostic features include left ventricular systolic dysfunction shown on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with wall motion abnormalities, generally with the typical ""apical ballooning"" pattern. In very rare cases, it involves a reverse form which is characterized by basal and mid-ventricular severe hypokinesia or akinesia, and sparing of the apex. TTS is known to be triggered by emotional or physical stressors. Recently, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been described as a potential trigger of TTS, especially when lesions are located in the brainstem. We herein report the case of a 26-year-old woman who developed cardiogenic shock due to reverse TTS in the setting of MS. After being admitted for suspected MS, the patient presented with rapidly deteriorating clinical condition, with acute pulmonary oedema and hemodynamic collapse, requiring mechanical ventilation and aminergic support. TTE found a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, consistent with reverse TTS (basal and mid ventricular akinesia, apical hyperkinesia). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 4 days later showed myocardial oedema in the mid and basal segments on T2-weighted imaging, with partial recovery of LVEF (46%), confirmed the diagnosis of TTS. In the meantime, the suspicion of MS was also confirmed, based on cerebral MRI and cerebral spinal fluid analyses, with a final diagnosis of reverse TTS induced by MS. High-dose intravenous corticotherapy was initiated. Subsequent evolution was marked by rapid clinical improvement, as well as normalization of LVEF and segmental wall-motion abnormalities. Our case is an example of the brain-heart relationship: it shows how neurologic inflammatory diseases can trigger a cardiogenic shock due to TTS, with potentially serious outcomes. It sheds light on the reverse form, which, although rare, has already been described in the setting of acute neurologic disorders. Only a handful of case reports have highlighted MS as a trigger of reverse TTS. Finally, through an updated systematic review, we highlight the unique features of patients with reversed TTS triggered by MS.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,10.3389/fcvm.2023.1175644,PMC10188972,brainstem lesions; cardiogenic shock; inverted takotsubo; multiple-sclerosis; reverse takotsubo; takotsubo; takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy; takotsubo syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The internal carotid arteries were involved in 4 patients and the vertebrobasilar arteries in 3, with bilateral vertebral artery occlusion in 1. Small cerebral infarction foci on cranial computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were found in 5 cases, and cerebellar infarction, in 2.

Two patients died. Necropsy demonstrated generalized GCA involving the medium and small cerebral vessels in 1 case. Central nervous system involvement is a rare complication in GCA but is important to recognize, as it can be reversible if diagnosed and treated promptly. Suspicion should arise in elderly patients suffering from strokes with a quickly progressing stepwise course and associated headache, fever, or inflammatory syndrome. In these cases, temporal artery biopsy should be performed without delay. Early diagnosis of GCA and immediate initiation of corticosteroid treatment may prevent progressive deterioration and death.

Clinical pathology tests detected increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, as well as alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin above the normal reference intervals. Ultrasonography showed hepatomegaly and a dilated gall bladder. Following these results, the cat was referred for a cholecystectomy owing to a clinical suspicion of obstructive cholecystitis. The animal died in the postoperative period and was referred for necropsy. Grossly, the animal had marked icterus. On the cortical surface and in the brain parenchyma there were marked yellowish areas. The liver was diffusely reddish-orange, enlarged and the capsular surface was slightly irregular. The gall bladder was absent. At its anatomical site and surrounding the common hepatic duct, a whitish nodular neoplasia of 2.0 cm was found. Microscopically, a cholangioma was diagnosed in the region of the common hepatic duct. In the white matter of the cerebellar vermis, there was axonal degeneration associated with gliosis. In the Purkinje neuron layer there was slight multifocal necrosis. Some neurons contained amorphous and brownish pigment (bilirubin) in the cytoplasm. Clinical and pathological findings indicated hepatic and post-hepatic icterus from obstructive cholangioma, resulting in kernicterus. Kernicterus is a neurological disorder that is rarely diagnosed in animals, especially in adults.

The occurrence of ICB in patients with IE significantly influences therapeutic decisions and has a negative impact on outcome. We describe the clinical courses of 3 patients with aortic prosthetic valve IE presenting with ICB. Patients 1 and 2 experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), respectively, caused by rupture of an intracranial infectious aneurysm (IIA). Both underwent endovascular treatment of IIA with good outcome. In patient 3, ICB was the hemorrhagic conversion of an acute ischemic lesion from septic brain embolization. In the subacute phase of the disease, aortic valve replacement was performed, with excellent outcome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: ICB is a relevant complication and sometimes the first clinical feature of IE. Imaging of brain vessels should be performed to investigate the pathologic mechanism underlying ICB. The prevalence of IIA is probably underestimated and may influence the therapeutic strategy. Cerebrovascular imaging may therefore also be considered in asymptomatic subjects with left-sided IE. Withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment and delay of cardiac surgery are recommended in all cases of IE complicated by ICB. Because of the impact of ICB on IE management and outcome, a high level of clinical suspicion and prompt recognition and treatment of this complication are necessary.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.04.003,,infectious aneurysm; infective endocarditis; intracerebral hemorrhage; subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although the exact etiology is unknown, AHLE usually manifests post a viral or bacterial infection and less often seen post vaccination for measles or rabies. AHLE has a very poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. Owing to the rarity of this entity there is not clear consensus on the proper line of management. In this report, we present a case of AHLE as a para-infectious sequel to COVID-19 in a young patient. We report a 30-year-old turkish patient with an initial presentation of upper respiratory tract infection due to COVID-19. Initially, she was admitted to the hospital with generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) and deterioration in her level of consciousness lapsing into a coma. An initial CT scan showed diffuse brain edema and an MRI head confirmed the suspicion of Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE). Despite prompt and diligent osmotic therapy and pulsed intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone, her condition rapidly depreciated and progressed into cerebral edema with gravid sequela of brainstem herniation. AHLE is a very rare entity and perhaps its fulminant debilitating course and high mortality should warrant further studies on disease pathophysiology and its optimal treatment parameters.

In both cases, surgical excision of the tumours was performed with no recurrences at follow-up. Two mechanisms can explain the formation of emboli in PFE: dislodgement of the tumour leaves or fibrin-platelet aggregation on the endocardial surface of these leaves.

Patients with aSDH associated with aneurysmal bleeding represent a subgroup within the spectrum of aneurysmatic hemorrhage. We summarize the clinical characteristics, diagnostic evaluation, and management of a series of cases presenting with aSDH associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Medical records and surgical reports of 743 consecutive patients admitted to our institution with SAH from January 1995 to December 2007 were screened to detect cases of associated aSDH. Admission evaluations included the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the subarachnoid grade of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS). Radiological assessment included computer tomography (CT) scan, CT angiography (CTA), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The presence and volume of SAH, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and aSDH were documented. Outcome was measured in terms of Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 4-8 months. A total of seven cases (0.9%) presenting with aSDH (mean width: 11.2 mm +/- 4.8 mm, range: 5-20 mm) attributable to SAH were documented. Three of these patients were admitted with a suspicion of trauma. Five patients presented with WFNS grade 5, one patient with WFNS grade 3, and one patient with WFNS grade 1. All patients underwent evacuation of the aSDH. In four patients, surgical obliteration of the aneurysm was achieved in the same procedure. Two patients underwent delayed occlusion of the aneurysm: one by coiling and one by clipping. Three of the seven patients recovered completely from their neurological deficits (GOS 5, mRS 0-1), three recovered with mild disability (GOS 4, mRS 2-3), and one died within 8 h after the decompressive procedure. The incidence of aSDH associated with SAH is low. Most of the patients with aSDH due to a ruptured aneurysm present in exceptionally poor neurological condition. Nevertheless, rapid surgical treatment of the hematoma and aneurysm obliteration can lead to a favorable outcome.

We present the case of a newborn admitted to a pediatric emergency department for lethargy and reduced oral intake; his laboratory evaluation showed severe hypernatremia ([Na<sup>+</sup>] of 174 mmol/L). The infant developed convulsive status epilepticus during treatment. Neuroimaging showed a tetraventricular hemorrhage, a large right-sided parenchymal hemorrhage with midline shift, and several left hemorrhagic foci. Etiologic evaluation for hypernatremia did not reveal a renal or extrarenal source of water loss nor an intercurrent illness to explain the reduced oral intake. A careful review of how the parents prepared the infant formula revealed an error in dosing the ratio of powder/water, resulting in hyperosmolar infant formula. The infant was diagnosed with salt poisoning as the major cause of hypernatremia. After careful correction of hypernatremia and the use of antiseizure medication, the patient improved and was discharged. The parents were given a careful review of instructions for infant formula preparation. Due to its rarity, a high index of suspicion is mandatory for a correct diagnosis of salt poisoning. Timely and adequate treatment is needed due to the high risk of intracerebral bleeding, seizures, and irreversible neurologic injury.

ICVT mostly appears in conjunction with sinus vein thromboses. ICVTs primarily occur during pregnancy and puerperium (35%). The great variability of cortical veins and difficulty identifying small occluded vessels complicate ICVT diagnosis. We present the first case of isolated ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement as a potential radiologic sign of ICVT shown on magnetic resonance imaging. A 30-year-old woman presented with sudden position-independent severe headache and neck pain 2 weeks postpartum. Standard magnetic resonance imaging revealed ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement of the meninges (left hemisphere). The symptoms and findings were interpreted as a post-lumbar puncture syndrome associated with the epidural anesthesia during labor and birth. Deteriorating, the patient was referred to our hospital after a computed tomography scan had revealed atypical left parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Digital cerebral subtraction angiography confirmed a left parietal ICVT as the underlying disease. When systemic anticoagulation was initiated, the patient's condition further deteriorated. Progressive aphasia and right-sided face and arm weakness and numbness developed as a result of increased intracranial hemorrhage volume. We therefore performed craniotomy and hematoma evacuation, after which the patient fully recovered. We hypothesize that ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement in patients presenting with severe headache may indicate ICVT and we suggest further diagnostic workup, using venographic study such as computed tomographic venography or magnetic resonance venography. In an inconclusive venographic study with high clinical suspicion for ICVT, catheter cerebral angiography is indicated.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.03.026,,Ipsilateral dural thickening; Isolated cortical vein thrombosis; Magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space. While a ""succession splash"" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary. The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan.
