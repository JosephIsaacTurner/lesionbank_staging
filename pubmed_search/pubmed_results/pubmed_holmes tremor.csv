32084623,Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration and Holmes Tremor: Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Dogan, Sebahat Nacar",Dogan,"Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is very rare type of degeneration that causes hypertrophy rather than atrophy. The classical presentation of HOD is palatal myoclonus. However, HOD may rarely present with Holmes tremor (HT). HT is unusual symptomatic tremor characterized by combination of rest and intention tremor. It has been reported in small case series, so far. In this study, a man aged 62 years with HOD and HT spreading to the upper and lower extremities after pontine-midbrain hemorrhage due to cavernoma was presented. Although pontine-midbrain hemorrhage may cause HT in the late period, HOD can be revealed on magnetic resonance imaging. Tract anatomy, especially the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, should be considered to explain the relationship between HT and HOD.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.02.068,,Guillain-Mollaret triangle; Holmes tremor; Hypertrophic olivary degeneration; Midbrain hemorrhage; Pontine hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

33616228,A rare case of Holmes tremor in a worker with occupational carbon monoxide poisoning.,"Rutchik, Jonathan; Bowler, Rosemarie M; Ratner, Marcia H",Rutchik,"Parkinsonism and encephalopathy are frequently seen in patients who survive carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Neurological findings associated with CO poisoning can emerge immediately after cessation of exposure or following a brief period of pseudo-recovery. When present, the tremor associated with CO poisoning is typical of the postural/intention type. Here, we report on a rare case of toxic encephalopathy with a dominant-hand Holmes-type tremor, characterized by resting, as well as postural and kinetic/intentional components, in a previously healthy 53-year-old man exposed to CO while actively engaged in the process of performing a physically demanding skilled labor task.

26778811,Holmes' tremor as a delayed complication of thalamic stroke.,"Martins, William Alves; Marrone, Luiz Carlos Porcello; Fussiger, Helena; Vedana, Viviane Maria; Cristovam, Rafael do Amaral; Taietti, Marjorye Z; Marrone, Antonio Carlos Huf",Martins,"Movement disorders are not commonly associated with stroke. Accordingly, thalamic strokes have rarely been associated with tremor, pseudo-athetosis and dystonic postures. We present a 75-year-old man who developed a disabling tremor 1 year after a posterolateral thalamic stroke. This tremor had low frequency (3-4 Hz), did not disappear on focus and was exacerbated by maintaining a static posture and on target pursuit, which made it very difficult to perform basic functions. MRI demonstrated an old ischemic lesion at the left posterolateral thalamus. Treatment with levodopa led to symptom control. Lesions in the midbrain, cerebellum and thalamus may cause Holmes' tremor. Delayed onset of symptoms is usually seen, sometimes appearing 2 years after the original injury. This may be due to maturation of a complex neuronal network, leading to slow dopaminergic denervation. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of this unique disconnection syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2015.09.014,,Holmes’ tremor; Movement disorders; Symptomatic tremor; Thalamic stroke; Thalamic tremor; Ventral posterolateral nucleus,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

6568936,Rubral tremor: clinical features and treatment of three cases.,"Berkovic, S F; Bladin, P F",Berkovic,"Rubral tremor is characterized by a slow coarse tremor at rest that is exacerbated by postural adjustments and by guided voluntary movements. Some authorities have questioned whether it should be regarded as a distinct clinical entity. We observed three cases of rubral tremor following stroke and studied the movements by videotape recordings. The tremors were very similar in the three cases, and all showed plastic rigidity and dystonic posturing of the affected limbs. Rehabilitation difficulties out of proportion to the motor deficit were present, but all three patients responded favourably to treatment with levodopa-carbidopa. Lesions of the superior cerebellar peduncle, midbrain tegmentum or posterior part of the thalamus may cause this peculiar tremor, and it is probable that lesions of the red nucleus itself are not crucial for its production. The similarity of the clinical features and management problems of these cases suggests that it is valuable to regard rubral tremor as a specific clinical syndrome.",{},,Clinical and experimental neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

In the first case, the patient presented with a midbrain tremor of the right upper extremity involving left midbrain and thalamic area. After MRI examination, he was placed on benztropine, amantadine, pramipexole and eventually levodopa for treatment, all of which were unsuccessful in improving his tremor. In the second case, the patient presented with a midbrain tremor of the right upper extremity after an hemorrhagic stroke. After viewing CT and MRI scans, the patient was placed on amantadine, pramipexole and eventually levodopa, all of which made no contributions to his tremor. The patient in the third case presented with a blunt trauma to the head which led to the development of a midbrain tremor of his left arm. CT and MRI scans showed abnormalities in the right side of the midbrain and pons. He was initially started on amantadine, with no improvement of his tremor. However, he was eventually placed on trihexyphenidyl which contributed to a 70% improvement in his tremor.

25800941,Steroid-responsive intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor: importance of a tissue diagnosis.,"Strowd, Roy E; Burger, Peter; Holdhoff, Matthias; Kleinberg, Lawrence; Okun, Michael S; Olivi, Alessandro; Pardo-Villamizar, Carlos; Schiess, Nicoline",Strowd,"Holmes' tremor (rubral or midbrain outflow tremor) refers to a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by mild resting and more severe postural and action tremor often with associated brainstem symptoms, dystonia and cerebellar deficits. This syndrome should prompt lesional evaluation with neuroimaging focused on the dorsal midbrain, cerebellar outflow tracts, and thalamus. Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2014.11.013,PMC4866638,Behçet’s disease; Germinoma; Holmes tremor; Multiple sclerosis; Rubral tremor,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

This tremor is usually related to lesions in the midbrain peduncular region involving the superior cerebellar peduncle, the red nucleus, and possibly the nigrostriatal circuitry. Common etiologies resulting in HT include tumor, ischemia, and demyelination. We report a case of progressive left-sided HT in an otherwise healthy man with additional symptoms of parkinsonism, hypoesthesia, right oculomotor nerve palsy, cognitive dysfunction, and hypersomnolence. Imaging investigations revealed a right-sided thalamic and midbrain glioma. Dopamine transport imaging demonstrated significant dopaminergic denervation in the right caudate and putamen. The degree of striatal dopamine transporter deficiency was more severe than expected in a patient with Parkinson disease. A trial of dopaminergic agent resulted in significant improvement of the tremor and associated symptoms. Interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway can occur in cases of HT because of midbrain peduncular lesion.

Three patients with Holmes tremor who visited the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM from August 2018 to April 2021 were retrospectively investigated to summarize their clinical and imaging data. Holmes tremor in two of the three patients was caused by hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and in the third patient induced by hemorrhage due to ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations. HT occurred 1 to 24 months after the primary disease onset and manifested as a tremor in the contralateral limb, mostly in the upper portion. Cranial MRI showed that the lesions involved the thalamus in all three patients. The damaged thalamic nuclei included the ventral anterior nucleus, ventral lateral nucleus and ventromedial lateral nucleus, and the damaged nerve fibers included left thalamocortical tracts in one patient. In the other two patients, the damaged thalamic nuclei included the centromedian and dorsomedial nucleus, and the damaged nerve fibers included left cerebellothalamic and thalamocortical tracts. One patient showed significant improvement after treatment with pramipexole while the other two patients exhibited a poor response, one of whom had no response to the treatment with pramipexole and was only significantly relieved by clonazepam. We used multimodal 3D medical imaging for the first time to analyze the pathogenesis of HT and found that multiple thalamic nuclei were damaged.

The case of a 20-year-old female patient is reported who developed right-sided Holmes' tremor 9 months after a left-sided, cavernoma induced midbrain/pontine haemorrhage at the age of 16 years. Beta-CIT single photon emission computed tomography revealed abolished dopamine transporter activity in the left basal ganglia and striatum, in accordance with missing ipsilateral tegmento-frontal connectivity (medial forebrain bundle), demonstrated by diffusion tensor MRI. Tractography showed reduced fibre connectivity of the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles on the lesioned side. Administration of pramipexole and L-DOPA led to a clinically significant reduction in tremor severity. In conclusion, our results support the notion that Holmes' tremor was a result of diminished striatal dopaminergic input in our patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2008.146324,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Slight motor weakness and spasticity with exaggerated tendon jerks and passive stretch-induced clonus were present on the same limb.

The unusual topography of the symptoms, their occurrence during motion, and the similar frequency of the passive clonus and the action tremor, led us to hypothesize that both patients had prolonged action-induced clonus, mimicking action tremor.

The interruption of the dento-rubro-thalamic tract and secondary deterioration of the nigrostriatal pathway are both required to initiate Holmes' tremor. We used nuclear medicine imaging tools to analyze a patient with concurrent infarction in different zones of each side of the thalamus. Finding whether the paramedian nuclear groups of the thalamus were injured was a decisive element for developing Holmes' tremor. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to our department due to a bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction. Seven months after the stroke, a unilaterally involuntary trembling with irregularly wavering motions occurring in both her left hand and forearm. Based on the distinct features of the unilateral coarse tremor and the locations of the lesions on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patient was diagnosed with bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction complicated with a unilateral Holmes' tremor. The patient refused our recommendation of pharmacological treatment with levodopa and other dopamine agonists based on personal reasons and was only willing to accept physical and occupational training programs at our outpatient clinic. We utilized serial anatomic and functional neuroimaging of the brain to survey the neurologic deficit. A brain magnetic resonance imaging showed unequal recovery on each side of the thalamus. The residual lesion appeared larger in the right-side thalamus and had gathered in the paramedian area. A brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed that the post-stroke hypometabolic changes were not only in the right-side thalamus but also in the right basal ganglion, which was anatomically intact. Furthermore, the brain Technetium-99m-labeled tropanes as a dopamine transporter imaging agents scan ( Tc-TRODAT-1) displayed a secondary reduction of dopamine transporters in the right nigrostriatal pathway which had resulted from the damage on the paramedian nuclear groups of the right-side thalamus. Based on the functional images, we illustrated that a retrograde degeneration originating from the thalamic paramedian nuclear groups, and extending forward along the direct innervating fibers of the mesothalamic pathway, played an essential role towards initiating Holmes' tremor.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000008633,PMC5704830,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Currently suggested pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease are mostly derived from stroke cases. Although rare, cerebral toxoplasmosis may strengthen the pathophysiologic mechanism of disease. A case of Holmes tremor secondary to cerebral toxoplasmosis in an AIDS patient is presented. A relevant literature search was performed, using pubmed and several entries for Holmes tremor as labelled in the literature. The unifying feature of our case and those of the literature is the involvement of either the cerebello-thalamo-cortical and/or the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways. The abscess or the extension of surrounding edema beyond these two circuits may account for the superimposed dysfunction of the nigrostriatal system in some but not all cases. The short delay observed in our observation and the dramatic response to treatment may indirectly support the secondary neuronal degeneration theory in the mechanism of Holmes tremor. Cases of cerebral toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients also provide arguments for the role of the thalamo-cortical and/or the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Holmes tremor.

38382934,[Resting tremor of Parkinson's disease changing into Holmes' tremor by cerebellar hemorrhage: an examination of the pathophysiological mechanism of tremor].,"Nakamura, Masahiro; Isono, Osamu; Nasu, Tetsuya; Hinuma, Yuji; Nakamura, Noriko",Nakamura,"A 71-year-old male who suffered from Hoehn and Yahr stage III Parkinson's disease with bradykinesia, rigidity and a 5-6-Hz tremor at rest in the right extremities was admitted to our hospital due to the sudden onset of vertigo. Right cerebellar hemorrhage was confirmed by CT. The patient's resting tremor in the right extremities disappeared immediately following the cerebellar hemorrhage. Six days later, MRI showed Wallerian degeneration in the cerebello-rubro-thalamic tract. Approximately 5 months later, a 2-3-Hz Holmes' tremor gradually appeared in the right upper extremity. This tremor was improved by increasing L-dopa doses. Case reports of the disappearance of Parkinson's resting tremor and subsequent emergence of Holmes' tremor due to cerebellar lesion are rare. Furthermore, the Wallerian degeneration of the cerebello-rubro-thalamic tract identified on MRI between tremors of the different frequencies is very rare. We hypothesize that the cause of the tremor frequency change was simultaneous damage to the nigro-striatal network and the cerebello-thalamo-cerebral network.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001936,,Parkinson’s disease; cerebellar hemorrhage; tremor,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

7893537,[Chronological changes in MR imaging of inferior olivary pseudohypertrophy--report of two cases].,"Terao, S; Sobue, G; Takahashi, M; Osano, Y; Shimada, N; Tsuboi, Y; Miura, N; Mitsuma, T",Terao,"Olivary pseudohypertrophy (OH) and its chronological change was examined by MR images in two patients with brainstem vascular disease. Patient 1 was a 63-year-old woman who developed an infarction in the red nuclei associated with ""top of the basilar"" syndrome. Two months later, she showed 2-4 c/s rhythmic myoclonus (rubral tremor) involving four extremities. Palatal myoclonus was absent. MR images of the inferior olives did not demonstrate a significant lesion in 10 days after the onset, but showed OH in 6 months, and then their size attained a maximum in 10 months after. On T2-weighted (T2) images and proton-density-weighted (PD) images obtained at 20 and 24 months, OH gradually became irregular but discrete in their intensity, and the intensity had also decreased to some extent. Rhythmic myoclonus had subsided to some extent after 20 to 24 months. Patient 2 was a 62-year-old woman who had a small hemorrhage in the pontine tegmentum. She developed 2.5 c/s vertical ocular myoclonus without palatal myoclonus two months after the onset. MR images showed OH in 6 and 8 months after the onset. On T2 and PD images obtained at 20 months, the image of OH gradually developed to become irregular in intensity and slightly atrophic in size. The ocular myoclonus somewhat reduced in their intensity 12 months after the onset. These serial changes in MR images were considered to correspond to the chronological changes of the pathology of OH. Appearance and subsidence of the myoclonic movement was also considered to correlate to the sequential changes of MR images of OH.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

7994988,[Involuntary movements caused by thalamic lesion].,"Moroo, I; Hirayama, K; Kojima, S",Moroo,"We described two types of involuntary movement accompanied with a well-located thalmaic lesion shown by MR imaging in five patients. All patients had the involuntary movements of an upper limb contralateral to the thalamic lesion. Two patients (1 and 2) had choreoathetosis that became most prominent when their index finger approached their nose, where irregular and dysynchronous oscillation occasionally superimposed. This choreoathetosis was differentiated from pseudoathetosis caused by disturbance of proprioceptive sensations. The MRI lesion was located at the middle level of thalamus including nucleus centromedianus. The other three patients (3, 4 and 5) had a regular and rhythmic oscillation in their forearm. The oscillation began to appear after their index finger reached their nose on finger-to-nose test. We considered the oscillation as a postural tremor based on its rhythmicity and regularity. Patient 4 had additional tremor in movement. Their postural tremor continued while the arm kept the position. Surface electromyogram showed the reciprocal discharges between the forearm extensor and flexor muscles with a frequency of 3 to 4 Hz. This tremor was not accentuated during limb movement toward the nose nor was coarse, and was distinguished from intention tremor described by Charcot and Dejerine. This tremor was also different from hyperkinesis volitionnelle and movement oppositionist. The ""rubral tremor"" differed from the tremor shown in our cases for a lack of resting tremor. The responsible lesion shown by MRI located at caudal posterior thalamus including pulvinar in patient 3, or located at the upper level of thalamus in patient 4 and case 5 that was more rostral than the lesion of the choreoathetosis cases. In cases of cerebrovascular accidents, both types of involuntary movement appeared after several months from the stroke. This delayed appearance suggests that these involuntary movements were the result not only of functional disturbance of thalamus, but of secondary repairing mechanism occurring at the lesion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
