34142117,Pathological laughter and crying: insights from lesion network-symptom-mapping.,"Klingbeil, Julian; Wawrzyniak, Max; Stockert, Anika; Brandt, Max-Lennart; Schneider, Hans-Ralf; Metelmann, Moritz; Saur, Dorothee",Klingbeil,"The study of pathological laughter and crying (PLC) allows insights into the neural basis of laughter and crying, two hallmarks of human nature. PLC is defined by brief, intense and frequent episodes of uncontrollable laughter or crying provoked by trivial stimuli. It occurs secondary to CNS disorders such as stroke, tumours or neurodegenerative diseases. Based on case studies reporting various lesions locations, PLC has been conceptualized as dysfunction in a cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamo-ponto-cerebellar network. To test whether the heterogeneous lesion locations are indeed linked in a common network, we applied 'lesion network-symptom-mapping' to 70 focal lesions identified in a systematic literature search for case reports of PLC. In lesion network-symptom-mapping normative connectome data (resting state functional MRI, n = 100) is used to identify the brain regions that are likely affected by diaschisis based on the lesion locations. With lesion network-symptom-mapping we were able to identify a common network specific for PLC when compared with a control cohort (n = 270). This bilateral network is characterized by positive connectivity to the cingulate and temporomesial cortices, striatum, hypothalamus, mesencephalon and pons, and negative connectivity to the primary motor and sensory cortices. In the most influential pathophysiological model of PLC, a centre for the control and coordination of facial expressions, respiration and vocalization in the periaqueductal grey is assumed, which is controlled via two pathways: an emotional system that exerts excitatory control of the periaqueductal grey descending from the temporal and frontal lobes, basal ganglia and hypothalamus; and a volitional system descending from the lateral premotor cortices that can suppress laughter or crying. To test whether the positive and negative PLC subnetworks identified in our analyses can indeed be related to an emotional system and a volitional system, we identified lesions causing emotional (n = 15) or volitional facial paresis (n = 46) in a second literature search. Patients with emotional facial paresis show preserved volitional movements but cannot trigger emotional movements in the affected hemiface, while the reverse is true for volitional facial paresis. Importantly, these lesions map differentially onto the PLC subnetworks: the 'positive PLC subnetwork' is part of the emotional system and the 'negative PLC subnetwork' overlaps with the volitional system for the control of facial movements. Based on this network analysis we propose a two-hit model of PLC: a combination of direct lesion and indirect diaschisis effects cause PLC through the loss of inhibitory cortical control of a dysfunctional emotional system.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awab224,,diaschisis; pseudobulbar affect; resting-state functional connectivity,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

27780330,Enhancing Approaches to the Identification and Management of Pseudobulbar Affect.,"Crumpacker, David W",Crumpacker,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a socially debilitating condition that primarily affects people with neurologic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or multiple sclerosis. This condition is characterized by uncontrolled, exaggerated expressions of laughing or crying-often when the situation does not warrant this behavior. Although the true prevalence of PBA is surprisingly high, this condition remains widely misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed. While its exact etiology is unknown, PBA likely results from disruptions in the brain structures and/or neurotransmitters that regulate emotions. Differential diagnosis of PBA includes ruling out depression or other psychiatric conditions. Treatment of PBA has traditionally centered on antidepressant therapies, but newer therapeutic options include combination agents employing multiple modalities. Therapy should include patient counseling to reassure patients and families that PBA is not the fault of the individual. Counseling should also emphasize safety precautions to minimize adverse events and maximize appropriate adherence to the selected therapies.",{},,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,10.4088/JCP.15136tx1cj,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

However, it is frequently missed in cases involving the cerebellum, resulting in a lack of treatment, which can directly impact stroke rehabilitation. A 63-year-old Caucasian female with no history of mood disorders presented with gait instability, dysarthria, and right sided hemiplegia, secondary to cerebellar and pontine ischemic stroke from a basilar occlusion. She underwent endovascular therapy and her deficits gradually improved. However during recovery she began to develop uncontrollable tearfulness while retaining insight that her emotional expression was contextually inappropriate. She was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported improvements in her emotional regulation at one year follow up. This case highlights cerebellar injury as a potential cause of poorly regulated emotions, or an emotional dysmetria. The recognition of this disorder in patients with cerebellar or pontine strokes is critical, as untreated pseudobulbar affect can impact future stroke rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04294-1,PMC10722665,Case report; Cerebellum; Depression; Emotional lability; Ischemic stroke; Pseudobulbar affect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35282555,Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Aggressive Behavior.,"Kazi, Sana Elham; Anwar, Adeel",Kazi,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is an affective disorder of emotional expression characterized by frequent uncontrollable outbursts of laughing or crying. It is usually associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological conditions. This disorder can present a challenge to clinicians to distinguish this from mood disorders or to diagnose this disorder in the context of underlying mood disorders. In addition, the delay in the diagnosis can impact patients' quality of life. We describe a 48-year-old man who presented with frequent episodes of sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughing two years after his recurrent stroke. The patient initially had his first stroke about three years ago and had a recurrent stroke eight months after his first stroke. A few days after getting discharged after his second stroke, the patient was admitted to the psychiatric unit after his family members reported aggressive behavior. The patient also reported symptoms of depression and was discharged on escitalopram for mood and divalproex for his aggressive behavior. Unfortunately, the patient was not compliant with these medications with no resolution of his symptoms. The patient was then treated with dextromethorphan-quinidine, escitalopram, and divalproex, resulting in significant improvement in his mood and aggressive behavior with a resolution of uncontrollable laughing spells.  Clinicians are encouraged to inquire about symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in the context of stroke or other neurological disorders. Appropriate management of this condition can help improve patients' symptoms and positively affect their wellbeing.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.21978,PMC8906197,aggressive behavior; aphasia; cannabis use; dextromethorphan-quinidine; pseudobular afffect; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng
26459199,Pathological laughter as prodromal manifestation of transient ischemic attacks--case report and brief review.,"Dulamea, Adriana O; Matei, Costel; Mindruta, Ioana; Ionescu, Virgil",Dulamea,"Based on a case report, the authors reviewed the data about involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED). IEED includes the syndromes of pathological laughing and crying (PLC) and emotional lability (EL). PLC is a rare disorder of emotional expression characterized by relatively uncontrollable episodes of laughter and crying or both that do not have an apparent motivating stimulus. Authors report the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with recurrent episodes of PLC of approximately 2 min duration, consisting of accelerated breathing, emission of guttural, snoring sounds, frowning of the eyebrows, followed by laughter accompanied by motor restlessness of all four limbs. PLC episodes preceded left carotid transient ischemic attacks (TIA's) manifested by reversible aphasia and right hemiparesis. Electroencephalography performed during PLC episodes revealed no spike-wave activity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed lacunar infarcts in the left lenticulo-capsulo-thalamic area and multiple round lesions in the cortical-subcortical and in the deep white matter of frontal-parietal-occipital lobes bilaterally, with T2 hyperintensity, T1 isointensity and no diffusion changes. The episodes were interpreted as transient ischemic attacks although gelastic seizures could not be excluded. The etiological investigations revealed unstable plaques on the left carotid artery bulb and the aortic arch and a degenerative mitral valve stenosis. The patient was treated first with antiplatelet therapy and antiepileptic drugs but PLC stopped only after anticoagulation was started. During follow-up the patient continued to have left carotid and vertebrobasilar TIA's being on oral anticoagulation. The patient became asymptomatic only after mitral valve replacement was performed. This case illustrates the difficulty distinguishing between gelastic epilepsy and TIA's in cases of PLC episodes and discuss the neuroanatomic bases and pathophysiology of this rare condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-015-0457-3,PMC4603769,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

An accurate estimate of the prevalence of PBA is hard to obtain due to varying diagnostic criteria and variable patient populations. The cause of PBA is not known, but current evidence suggests dual etiology. A neural circuit dysfunction and an abnormality of neurotransmitters that regulate motor expression of emotions. PBA can easily be mistaken for a depressive disorder due to the overlap of symptoms. Moreover, patients with PBA may have a major depressive disorder (MDD) or other depressive disorders. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and treat PBA as well as possible psychiatric comorbidities. We present a case report of a 59-year-old man with no past psychiatric history who presents with paroxysms of episodes of crying for the past one year.

The objective of this work is to study the links between these disorders through a clinical case. We present the case of a 43-year-old man without previous psychiatric history who experienced emotional incontinence after cerebrovascular events. He reacted promptly to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. However, he experienced his first episode of hypomania after 6 months of antidepressant therapy. Adjunctive therapy with valproic acid and low-dose paroxetine was eventually added, resulting in complete improvement of both emotional incontinence and hypomania after 4 additional months of treatment.

32313749,Pseudobulbar Affect Presenting as Hypomania.,"Espiridion, Eduardo D; Mitchell, Cassandra; Kadakia, Shreeja",Espiridion,"Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a behavioral syndrome associated with various neurological conditions that typically manifests as uncontrollable laughing or crying. PBA can significantly impact the quality of life of patients affected as these spells can be inappropriate to the social setting or incompatible with the patient's emotional state. The underlying mechanism of PBA appears to be associated with disinhibition in neuronal pathways involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. One hypothesis for the pathology of PBA is that it is the result of disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar circuits, impairing cerebellar modulation of affect, and leading to uncontrolled emotional lability. Stroke, and other neurological disorders, interrupt these neuronal circuits causing disinhibition of the voluntary control of emotional expression. It is extremely important to recognize and appropriately diagnose the condition. We present a case report of an 85-year-old female patient who presented with a thalamic stroke, and she subsequently developed hypomania with symptoms of decreased need for sleep, mood lability, pressured speech, and religious preoccupation.

Neuroimaging revealed a large left-sided contrast-enhancing tumor located at the infratentorial space consistent with a large trochlear nerve schwannoma. The tumor was compressing the brainstem, obstructing the outflow of the third and lateral ventricles causing hydrocephalus, and disturbing the cortico-bulbar pathways bilaterally leading to the diagnosis of pseudobulbar palsy. After the patient consented the surgical procedure, he was operated through a subtemporal transtentorial approach placed in the lateral position.

This case report documents a case of a 55-year-old male presenting with emotional lability or pseudobulbar affect as the predominant or sole manifestation of VAN. A failure to adjust valacyclovir's dose for herpes simplex infection in the setting of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESRD) preceded VAN in this patient. The patient presented with involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of emotion. Computerized tomography (CT) scan identified no underlying cause. A complete neurological examination with cognitive assessment was performed, with no abnormalities. He benefited from the use of aggressive peritoneal dialysis (PD) that was employed to enhance valacyclovir's clearance in this case of intractable VAN. On discharge, the patient was back to baseline mental function. Traumatic brain injury, neoplasm, vascular lesions, metabolic abnormality, neurological disease, herpetic encephalitis, and disorders of mood were ruled out. This led to the hypothesis of encephalopathy due to valacyclovir intoxication. Given that the clinical manifestations were related to ESRD, a dose-adjustment of valacyclovir is imperative in the setting of ESRD to prevent VAN. Our case presents important clinical variations. Firstly, our patient demonstrates that VAN may present with no focal neurological impairment, but pseudobulbar affect. Secondly, aggressive PD was useful in this case for the treatment of VAN as opposed to hemodialysis.

7711357,Treatment of uncontrolled crying after stroke.,"Andersen, G",Andersen,"Uncontrolled crying after stroke is a disturbance of the motor concomitants of emotional affect. It manifests as stereotyped outbursts of crying that are excessive to an appropriate emotional response. The episodes can be triggered by almost any kind of emotional stimulus (happiness, excitement, sadness, just being looked at or talked to, the sight of a doctor, etc.) and can even occur without any obvious external or internal stimulus. The condition is socially embarrassing, and in the most severely affected patients the crying episodes can be so violent that they interfere with rehabilitation. Although frequent (1-year incidence is 20%), the condition often goes unrecognised because patients and relatives rarely complain about it spontaneously. Effective treatment has now been documented in 3 controlled studies of tricyclic antidepressants and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. There seems to be a rationale for the latter approach to treatment, in that post-stroke pathological crying may be attributable to stroke-induced partial destruction of the serotonergic raphe nuclei in the brainstem or their ascending projections to the hemispheres. Although our knowledge of the aetiology and treatment of the condition is limited, and the need for further study is considerable, the present treatment possibilities can significantly improve quality of life for patients with this socially embarrassing and sometimes debilitating condition.",{},,Drugs & aging,10.2165/00002512-199506020-00003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,New Zealand,eng

38454893,Psychotic Disorder after Left Posterior Cerebral Artery Stroke-An Atypical Event.,"Nascimento, Henrique; Almeida, Bárbara",Nascimento,"Stroke survivors usually present physical and neuropsychiatric complications. Post-stroke psychosis (PSPsy) is a particularly neglected sequel despite its disruptive nature. To present a case of early emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms following a left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. To review and discuss PSPsy clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and clinical outcomes. A previously autonomous 68-year-old woman with vascular risk factors and depressive disorder presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of disorientation, motor aphasia, and right hypoesthesia. Computer tomography revealed a left PCA stroke. She was started on acetylsalicylic acid and rosuvastatin and discharged the next day. Afterward, the patient developed a depressive mood, emotional lability, periods of confusion, delusions of persecution, guilt and unworthiness, auditory hallucinations, and suicide ideation. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and started on risperidone with a good response, being discharged after 15 days with the resolution of psychiatric symptoms. PSPsy is more common after right hemisphere lesions and usually develops after some months. Nevertheless, our patient presented PSPsy following an ischemic event of the left PCA, with neuropsychiatric symptomatology dominating the clinic since the beginning. The involvement of the retrosplenial cortex or its connections was likely important for this atypical presentation. Due to the lack of guidelines on approaching PSPsy, most patients are treated with the same strategies used for non-stroke patients. A better comprehension of the anatomical basis underlining the symptomatology in these patients could deepen the understanding of psychosis and psychotic disorders.",{},,Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,,PMC10926015,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng
21079459,Effectiveness of quetiapine for poststroke pathological laughing: case report and review of the literature.,"Chen, Yu-Ren; Huang, Ya-Ping; Lin, Shan-Ju; Kuan, Tsao-Hsiang; Lin, Chin-Hsien",Chen,"Pathological laughing (PL) is an uncommon distressing symptom that occurs in patients with various neurological disorders. Dysregulation of serotonergic system has been proposed as one of the possible mechanisms resulting in this condition, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used for treatment of PL with variable effects. However, the pathogenetic mechanism of PL remains largely elusive, and other treatment choices needs to be explored. This case report illustrates the beneficial effect of quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent with enhancing serotonergic neurotransmitter activity, in a patient with post-stroke PL. In addition, previously reported post-stroke PL cases searched from PubMed (1993-2010) were also reviewed. In this report, we demonstrate a 42-year-old man who developed PL 4 weeks after a hemorrhage stroke affecting the paramedian pons. He was treated with dextromethorphan initially but did not show obvious response. Then, the medication was shifted to quetiapine at a dosage of 25 mg/d. There was a significant and rapid recovery 2 days after quetiapine treatment. Our observations expand the current knowledge of treatment of PL caused by pontine lesions. Further large-scale controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the beneficial and differential effects of quetiapine on PL.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/WNF.0b013e3181f6bfbe,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng
21855865,Posterior fossa syndrome in adults: a new case and comprehensive survey of the literature.,"Mariën, Peter; De Smet, Hyo Jung; Wijgerde, Ellen; Verhoeven, Jo; Crols, Roel; De Deyn, Peter P",Mariën,"Although the posterior fossa syndrome (PFS) can be considered as an aetiologically heterogeneous condition affecting children and adults, it most often occurs in paediatric patients after cerebellar tumour surgery. In patients with a tumoural aetiology, the syndrome is typically characterised by a short symptom-free postoperative period followed by mutism of variable duration and behavioural and affective changes. More than 200 paediatric cases have been described but reports of adult patients are extremely rare. This paper discusses PFS in adults on the basis of a comprehensive literature survey and describes the pre- and postoperative findings in a new adult patient. In the preoperative phase, cognitive, behavioural and affective abnormalities were identified, matching a diagnosis of cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) (Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998; Schmahmann, 2004). The immediate postoperative course was characterised by prefrontal-like behavioural and affective abnormalities, peduncular hallucinations and confusion evolving to psychosis. Akinetic mutism subsequently developed, lasted for 12 days and then alternated with episodes of diminished responsiveness in which pathological laughing and crying (PLC) occurred. Akinetic mutism resolved after treatment with a non-ergoline dopamine-agonist but CCAS persisted during longitudinal follow-up. From a semiological point of view ""relapsing-remitting akinetic mutism"" and PLC in our patient might add relevant information to current insights in the clinical expression of the PFS. As evidenced by a close parallelism between single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and clinical findings, CCAS as well as PFS seem to reflect functional disruption of the cerebello-cerebral network involved in cognitive, behavioural and affective functions. These findings may indicate that both syndromes share overt semiological resemblances and a common pathophysiological substrate. Consequently, CCAS and PFS may both be regarded as cerebellar-induced clinical conditions showing different aspects of a spectrum that range in degree of severity and symptom duration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2011.06.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Italy,eng

29568656,Emotional Lability as a Unique Presenting Sign of Suspected Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.,"Yuan, Shauna H; Wang, Sonya G",Yuan,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by head trauma. Diagnosis of this disease is difficult as reliable biomarkers have not been established and often this clinical entity is underappreciated with poor recognition of its clinical presentations (Lenihan and Jordan, 2015). The definitive diagnosis of CTE is determined by identification of neurofibrillary tangles in the perivascular space around the sulci in postmortem tissue (McKee et al., 2015). However, performing brain biopsies searching for neurofibrillary tangles is not a feasible option for early diagnosis. Thus, diagnosis of suspected CTE in the living has been based on clinical suspicion using proposed research criteria of clinical presentations. In addition, neuroimaging techniques have shown some promise in assisting diagnosis. Clinically, CTE is more commonly known to be associated with memory impairment and executive function disorder (Stern et al., 2013). However, here, we present two unique cases of prior professional football players where behavioral changes were the first identifying factors in clinical presentation and discuss possible neuroimaging options to help with CTE diagnosis. Because behavioral changes can be mistaken for other neuropsychological diseases, recognizing differing clinical constellations is critical to early diagnosis, early intervention, and improving patient care in suspected CTE.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2018/2621416,PMC5820587,,Case Reports,United States,eng

Some pharmacotherapies, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are effective in alleviating pathologic laughing. However, contrary to previous reports, we report a case of pathologic laughing that developed after a patient with pontine hemorrhage was administered atomoxetine (Strattera). A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with acute intracerebral hemorrhage in the right pons and midbrain. The patient showed mild cognitive impairment, and he was administered 10 mg of atomoxetine once daily as a cognitive enhancer. On the day of atomoxetine administration, he suddenly developed episodes of inappropriate laughter that was uncontrollable. The Pathological Laughter and Crying Scale showed a score of 4 of 54 on the day he started taking atomoxetine, and his score was 18 on the second day. He was administered atomoxetine for 3 consecutive days, but it was stopped on the fourth day. His laughing diminished, and his score improved to 5. His smiling expression and a score of 1 on the scale lasted for 1 week. On day 8 of drug discontinuation, his score was zero and all symptoms disappeared. Previously, no single medication has been reported to cause pathologic laughing. Atomoxetine is a stimulant that increases norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. This report suggests that, unlike what is known thus far, norepinephrine and dopamine might play a crucial role in the development of pathologic laughing.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/WNF.0000000000000433,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

30349257,Postseizure aphasia in Wernicke's encephalopathy: a case report and review of literature.,"Devaraj, Sandhya; Muralles, Sara A; Gill, Chandler E; Meresh, Edwin",Devaraj,"This case discusses the course of a woman with a history of epilepsy, alcohol use disorder, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, and Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) who presented with altered mental status following approximately 48 hours of vomiting. After experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure in the emergency department, she developed a fluent aphasia. Aphasias are ordinarily attributed to structural changes in the brain parenchyma, often from stroke, neoplasm, or infection. When the magnetic resonance imaging of brain failed to show changes that could explain her fluent aphasia, the neurology team consulted psychiatry to workup psychogenic aphasia. During an admission 9 months earlier, she had been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis and possible WE. There was a high degree of suspicion for recurrent HSV infection, intermittent focal seizure activity, postictal psychosis, pseudobulbar affect, or a vascular cause of her fluent aphasia. After 3 days of treatment with levetiracetam, high-dose intravenous thiamine, and aripiprazole, the patient's fluent aphasia reversed. The authors conclude that the patient's reversible fluent aphasia was not psychiatric in etiology but likely caused by her seizures, the result of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels; her electroencephalogram showed focal seizure activity in the temporal lobes, possibly affecting her language centers. Language-related neurological conditions, or aphasias, can mimic psychiatric conditions such as conversion disorder or psychosis. In patients with substance use disorders, the line between psychiatric and neurological conditions becomes even more difficult to distinguish. The paper also discusses how unique aspects of her medications - levetiracetam conferring neuron membrane fluidity; aripiprazole, a drug shown to halt brain atrophy in mouse models; and parenteral thiamine to address her deficiency and WE - have aided in the reversal of the fluent aphasia. Levetiracetam should be considered in WE and the rare occurrence of aphasia after seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S174481,PMC6183589,Wernicke’s encephalopathy; alcohol withdrawal; aphasia; levetiracetam; seizure; thiamine,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

She was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Despite steroid pulse therapy following administration of intravenous high-dose γ-globulin, clinical manifestations remained unchanged. Therefore, plasma exchange was performed on day 10 of the illness. The titer of serum <i>Mycoplasma</i> immunoglobulin M level was increased. Immunological testing was positive for serum anti-galactocerebroside C antibody. On day 18 of the illness, however, she developed generalized convulsion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed high intensity in the medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and thalamus on T2-weighted intensity imaging, which was consistent with limbic encephalitis.

However, it remains poorly understood. The authors present a case report and analyze all the cases in the literature to try to localize a putative faciorespiratory center. This 13-year-old girl developed a pontine abscess subsequent to sphenoid sinusitis. This increased in size despite antibiotic treatment, and she developed PLC. The abscess was then stereotactically aspirated, with resolution of the symptoms. A PubMed search of the term ""pathological laughter and crying"" was performed. From these papers all reported cases of PLC were identified. Cases without neuroimaging were excluded. The remaining cases were categorized as small lesions permitting accurate localization within the pons, or large nonlocalizing lesions. All images of localizing lesions were magnified to the same size and placed on a grid. From this an area of maximal overlap was identified. The authors identified 7 cases of small localizing lesions with adequate imaging. The area of maximal overlap was in the region of the anterior paramedian pons. All the lesions involved this region of the pons. There were 28 further reports of large lesions that either resulted in gross compressive distortion of the pons or diffusely infiltrated it, and thus, although implicating involvement of a pontine center, did not allow for localization of a specific region of the pons. The authors report a case of PLC caused by a pontine abscess. Symptoms were reversible with stereotactically assisted aspiration and antibiotic administration. Analysis of the lesions reported in the literature showed a pattern toward a regulatory center in the pons. The most consistently involved region was in the anterior paramedian pons, and this may be the site of a faciorespiratory center.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery.

Still, most biographers consider diffuse atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure to be reasons for Haydn's medical condition and physical decline during the last years of his life.

Important features of the disease are mood changes, urinary symptoms, and in particular a characteristic gait disturbance, while dementia is only mild and occurs later in the course. Haydn was severely disabled by the symptoms of SVE for several years and often reported difficulties in the completion of his last oratorio ""Die Jahreszeiten"" (The Seasons).

This condition can result in diagnostic confusion and unrelieved suffering when clinicians interpret the emotional expressions at face value. In addition, the nomenclature, etiology, and treatment for this condition remain unclear in the medical literature. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis who was referred to an inpatient psychiatry unit with complaints of worsening depression along with hopelessness, characterized by unrelenting crying. Our investigation showed that her symptoms were caused by pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence stemming from multiple sclerosis. The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the fact that she identified herself as depressed only because of her incessant crying suggested that her symptoms might be due to the multiple sclerosis rather than to a depressive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a new plaque consistent with multiple sclerosis lateral to her corpus callosum. Her symptoms resolved completely within three days on valproic acid but returned after she was cross-tapered to dextromethorphan plus quinidine, which is the FDA-approved treatment for this condition. This case provides important additional information to the current literature on pseudobulbar affect/emotional incontinence. The existing literature suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) as first-line treatments; however, our patient was taking an SSRI at the time of presentation without appreciable benefit, and her symptoms responded to valproic acid but not to the dextromethorphan/quinidine.

11522574,Pathological laughter and crying: a link to the cerebellum.,"Parvizi, J; Anderson, S W; Martin, C O; Damasio, H; Damasio, A R",Parvizi,"Patients with pathological laughter and crying (PLC) are subject to relatively uncontrollable episodes of laughter, crying or both. The episodes occur either without an apparent triggering stimulus or following a stimulus that would not have led the subject to laugh or cry prior to the onset of the condition. PLC is a disorder of emotional expression rather than a primary disturbance of feelings, and is thus distinct from mood disorders in which laughter and crying are associated with feelings of happiness or sadness. The traditional and currently accepted view is that PLC is due to the damage of pathways that arise in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex and descend to the brainstem to inhibit a putative centre for laughter and crying. In that view, the lesions 'disinhibit' or 'release' the laughter and crying centre. The neuroanatomical findings in a recently studied patient with PLC, along with new knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and feeling, gave us an opportunity to revisit the traditional view and propose an alternative. Here we suggest that the critical PLC lesions occur in the cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathways and that, as a consequence, the cerebellar structures that automatically adjust the execution of laughter or crying to the cognitive and situational context of a potential stimulus, operate on the basis of incomplete information about that context, resulting in inadequate and even chaotic behaviour.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.9.1708,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Catatonia is a common feature of the syndrome. The authors describe a case of recurrent delirium/mania with prominent catatonic features after a cerebellar and pontine stroke, and subsequent successful treatment with lorazepam. Symptoms quickly resolved after antipsychotics were discontinued, with continuation of valproate and lorazepam treatment. Failure to recognize this patient's syndrome as a form of catatonia could have had severe, even life-threatening, consequences. The use of neuroleptic medications in cases of delirium/mania with catatonic signs may result in marked clinical deterioration, whereas high-dose lorazepam can ameliorate catatonic signs.",{},,Psychosomatics,10.1176/appi.psy.50.3.285,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It has rarely been reported in association with isolated cerebral lesions. Midbrain involvement causing pathological laughter is extremely unusual. We describe three patients who developed pathological laughter after midbrain and pontine-midbrain infarction. In two patients a small infarction in the left paramedian midbrain was detected, whereas the third one sustained a massive bilateral pontine infarction extending to the midbrain. Laughter heralded stroke by one day in one patient and occurred as a delayed phenomenon three months after stroke in another. Pathological laughter ceased within a few days in two patients and was still present at a two year follow-up in the patient with delayed-onset laughter. Pathological laughter can herald midbrain infarction or follow stroke either shortly after onset of symptoms or as a delayed phenomenon. Furthermore, small unilateral midbrain infarctions can cause this rare complication.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2004/409248,PMC5488615,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Rarely, PLS may present with clinical features resembling parkinsonism resulting in occasional misdiagnosis as one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Here we describe five patients initially referred with a diagnosis of levodopa-unresponsive atypical parkinsonism (n = 4) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 1), but subsequently found to have features consistent with PLS instead. Onset age varied from 49 to 67 years. Unilateral limb slowness or clumsiness was the initial complaint in four, and bulbar symptoms in one. Repeated finger/foot tapping was slow in all five, but without fatiguing or decrement. Spasticity with hyperreflexia, exaggerated jaw jerk and extensor plantar responses were eventually seen in all patients. Anterior horn cell involvement developed in three cases. Early gait disturbances resulting in falls were seen in all patients and none of them responded to dopaminergic medications. Two patients underwent dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT scanning with normal results. Other features included emotional lability (n = 5) and cognitive impairment involving frontal subcortical systems (n = 1). In conclusion, these cases represent a subgroup of PLS patients in whom pyramidal slowness may be mistaken for akinesia, and spasticity misconstrued as rigidity, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism. However, the absence of fatiguing and decrement on repeated finger/foot tapping should help to distinguish these patients from the true atypical parkinsonian syndromes.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.21645,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 60-year-old woman developed PLC after an ischemic stroke affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes. She was treated with lamotrigine initially at the dose of 50 mg a day, which was gradually increased to 100 mg a day over a 4-week period. There was a significant and rapid recovery in both laughing and crying components of PCL with lamotrigine treatment.

He was one of the most important members of the Medici family. He was an excellent conqueror and a good politician. Moreover, he was able to attract and encourage artists, scientists and architects to promote Florence as the cultural capital of the Italian Renaissance. Historical chronicles report that he suffered from a stroke when he was 49 years old. Together with the acute manifestation of stroke, he displayed peculiar symptoms. He had gait disturbances and sphincter dysfunctions. His language became poor and hard to understand. His mood was very fluctuating and in the last years of his life he was a short-tempered man. In addition, he had a characteristic symptom, so-called pathological laughing and crying. The course of his disease was slow and stuttering. Taken together, these data seem to be one of the first reports of pseudobulbar paralysis. The disease of Cosimo I was probably due to a chronic cerebral vasculopathy, known as small vessels disease.

25237748,Cerebellar allocentric and action-intentional spatial neglect.,"Milano, Nicholas J; Heilman, Kenneth M",Milano,"Contralesional hemispatial neglect most often results from lesions in the right posterior temporoparietal cortex. Less commonly, contralesional and ipsilesional neglect are caused by lesions in the frontal lobe. Although unilateral left cerebellar lesions have been reported to cause body-centered (egocentric) ipsilesional neglect, they have not been reported to cause left-side object-centered (allocentric) neglect together with a leftward action-intentional bias. We describe a patient who had these signs of neglect 7 months after a left cerebellar hemorrhage. This 61-year-old right-handed woman reported emotional lability and difficulty walking, frequently bumping into things on her left side. Neurologic examination revealed ocular dysmetria and left-side limb ataxia. Neuropsychological tests showed evidence of neglect. On a clock-drawing test, the patient accurately drew a circle but her number placement deviated to the left side. She showed the same leftward deviation when she tried to draw a circle composed of small triangles. Although her line bisection was normal, on an allocentric task of open-triangle cancellation she was most likely to neglect triangles with a left-side opening. Her performance on this task indicated left allocentric neglect. Her leftward deviation on the clock and figure drawing tasks seems to be a form of an action-intentional grasp, which may have been induced by right frontal dysfunction superimposed on a deficit of global attention.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000033,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

The purpose of this case report is to describe the 14-month longitudinal rehabilitation management and outcomes from the intensive care unit, inpatient rehabilitation unit and outpatient care of a patient after cerebellar stroke. A goal of this case report is to provide rehabilitation clinicians with a long-term perspective and understanding of the course of recovery for a patient after cerebellar cerebrovascular accident or related injury. A 51-year-old healthy athletic female experienced acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts with subsequent craniotomy to remove infarcted areas. The patient had postoperative hemorrhages and hydrocephalus and was deemed to have a poor prognosis. Multimodal sensory stimulation and early mobility was performed until conventional neuromuscular reeducation interventions could be tolerated. Primary deficits included decreased proximal strength, whole body ataxia, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, difficulty communicating, and emotional lability. Fourteen months after the initial infarcts, the patient was able to reside in her own home with her husband, ambulate, and stand with assistance and perform most activities of daily living with standby or set-up assistance. This patient made significant progress toward safety and mobility and was able to return home despite the early discussion about a poor prognosis and a palliative care consultation. The complex, intensive course of rehabilitation elicited slow, steady, consistent gains. The patient's motivation and family involvement likely facilitated optimum outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.1949,PMC5812525,cerebellar diplopia; cerebellar stroke; cerebellum; early mobility; icu; multimodal sensory stimulation; occupational therapy; palliative; physical therapy; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng
37046335,Use of disease assessment tools to increase the value of case reports on Susac syndrome: two case reports.,"Bullock, Danielle R; Spencer, Robert T; Vehe, Richard K; Srivastava, Sunil; Rennebohm, Robert M",Bullock,"Susac syndrome is an immune-mediated, ischemia-producing, occlusive microvascular endotheliopathy that threatens the brain, retina, and inner ear. There is a need for disease assessment tools that can help clinicians and patients to more easily, accurately, and uniformly track the clinical course and outcome of Susac syndrome. Ideally, such tools should simultaneously facilitate the clinical care and study of Susac syndrome and improve the value of future case reports. To meet this need, two novel clinical assessment tools were developed: the Susac Symptoms Form and the Susac Disease Damage Score. The former is a comprehensive self-report form that is completed by patients/families to serially document the clinical status of a patient. The latter documents the extent of damage perceived by individual patients/families and their physicians. Both forms were initially trialed with two particularly representative and instructive patients. The results of this trial are shared in this report. Patient 1 is a 21-year-old Caucasian female who presented with an acute onset of headache, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, and emotional lability. Patient 2 is a 14-year-old Caucasian female who presented with an acute onset of headache, cognitive dysfunction, urinary incontinence, ataxia, and personality change. Both patients fulfilled criteria for a definite diagnosis of Susac syndrome: both eventually developed brain, retinal, and inner ear involvement, and both had typical ""snowball lesions"" on magnetic resonance imaging. The Susac Symptoms Form documented initial improvement in both patients, was sufficiently sensitive in detecting a subsequent relapse in the second patient, and succinctly documented the long-term clinical course in both patients. The Disease Damage Score documented minimal disease damage in the first patient and more significant damage in the second. The Susac Symptoms Form and the Disease Damage Score are useful disease assessment tools, both for clinical care and research purposes. Their use could enhance the value of future case reports on Susac syndrome and could improve opportunities to learn from a series of such reports.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-03838-9,PMC10097450,Case report; Clinical course; Disease assessment tools; Outcome; Susac syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Resonance imaging revealed the existence of an acute ischaemic lesion in the left territory of the cingulate gyrus and an electroencephalogram revealed the existence of epileptogenic activity in the left-hand anterior temporal and frontal regions. The clinical profile, the results of the complementary examinations and the response to the antiepileptic treatment allow us to state that in the episode reported in this patient we are dealing with gelastic seizures related to an acute ischaemic lesion in the left cingulate gyrus.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed leptomeningeal lesions with abnormal enhancement. MRI lesions were localized predominantly in the right cerebral subarachnoid spaces. Electroencephalogram showed epileptogenic focus at the right frontal and central points. After administration of valproate sodium improved convulsion and myoclonus, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using N-isopropyl-p-(123)I-iodoamphetamine was performed. Brain SPECT displayed hypoperfusion predominantly in the right cerebral hemisphere. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disclosed mild pleocytosis and marked elevations of interleukin-6 levels. Repeated CSF analyses showed cytology of class I and negative results for infectious pathogens. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (1 g for 3 days, iv) and subsequent prednisolone administration (daily 50 mg, po) ameliorated neurological symptoms dramatically. Prednisolone was tapered to 20 mg/day for 5 months. Leptomeningeal MRI lesions were attenuated gradually followed by restoration of cerebral hypoperfusion on SPECT. He was diagnosed as rheumatoid leptomeningitis (RLM). Although clinical features of RLM exhibited variable deficits of the central nervous system (CNS), MRI failed to detect the corresponding CNS lesions. We first highlighted neuroradiological changes of cerebral hypoperfusion and leptomeningeal lesions in RLM. These neuroimages of our patient supported that leptomeningeal inflammation and the adjacent cerebrocortical ischemia could cause encephalitis-like symptoms in RLM patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.2169/internalmedicine.49.3492,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

15128614,The human basis pontis: motor syndromes and topographic organization.,"Schmahmann, Jeremy D; Ko, Ryeowon; MacMore, Jason",Schmahmann,"Clinical-anatomic correlations were performed in 25 patients with focal infarcts in the basilar pons to determine whether pontine lacunar syndromes conform to discrete clinical entities, and whether there is topographic organization of the motor system within the human basis pontis. Twelve clinical signs were scored on a 6-point scale, neuroimaging lesions were mapped and defined with statistical certainty, and structure-function correlation was performed to develop a topographic map of motor function. Clinical findings ranged from major devastation following extensive lesions (pure motor hemiplegia) to incomplete basilar pontine syndrome and restricted deficits after small focal lesions (ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, dysarthria-dysmetria and dysarthria-facial paresis). The syndromes are not absolutely discrete, and are distinguished from each other by the relative degree of involvement of each clinical feature. Structure-function correlations indicate that strength is conveyed by the corticofugal fibres destined for the spinal cord, whereas dysmetria results from lesions involving the neurons of the basilar pons that link the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Facial movement and articulation are localized to rostral and medial basilar pons; hand coordination is medial and ventral in rostral and mid-pons; and arm function is represented ventral and lateral to the hand. Leg coordination is in the caudal half of the pons, with lateral predominance. Swallowing is dependent upon the integrity of a number of regions in the rostral pons. Gait is in medial and lateral locations throughout the rostral- caudal extent of the pons. Dysmetria ipsilateral to the lesion constitutes a disconnection syndrome, as it occurs when the hemipontine lesion is extensive and interrupts pontocerebellar fibres traversing from the opposite, intact side of the pons. The heterogeneity of manifestations reflects the well-organized topography of motor function in the human basis pontis, in agreement with the anatomic organization of the motor corticopontine projections in the monkey. Higher order impairments including motor neglect, paraphasic errors and pathological laughter result from rostral and medial pontine lesions, and may result from disruption of the pontine component of associative corticopontocerebellar circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh138,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
33272325,"Treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in a patient with a history of traumatic brain injury, partial brain resection, and brainstem stroke: a case report.","Young, Fletcher Graham; Nguyen, Diep",Young,"Pseudobulbar affect is a very distressing and underdiagnosed neuropsychiatric disorder that causes contextually inappropriate episodes of laughing and crying and general emotional incontinence. Although many proposed etiologies exist, the most widely accepted theory espouses the disruption of a corticopontine-cerebellar circuit that governs the modulation of emotional response. Pseudobulbar affect is commonly diagnosed secondary to primary neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Traditional pharmacological treatment of pseudobulbar affect is largely comprised of antidepressant therapy, including tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluvoxamine. However, neither of these medication classes has been studied for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect in controlled trials, and their utility remains questionable. We describe a case of a 62-year-old Caucasian man with history of traumatic brain injury, ischemic brainstem stroke, and depression who developed intractable pseudobulbar affect. This patient's intensely distressing symptoms were not alleviated by amitriptyline. However, after being placed on fixed-dose 20 mg/10 mg dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta), our patient experienced complete resolution of his symptoms. He has experienced no deleterious side effects. This case provides anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of dextromethorphan/quinidine in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect with remarkably swift and complete cessation of symptoms. As a secondary point, it is worth noting that our patient had experienced two devastating neurological traumas, both in anatomical areas that have been implicated in the corticopontine-cerebellar circuit thought to be responsible for pseudobulbar affect. However, only the second trauma, an acute left pontine infarction, produced symptoms of emotional disinhibition. The authors hope that reporting this case will provide both context for physicians managing this condition and hope for patients with this socially and psychiatrically damaging disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-020-02525-3,PMC7716484,Case report; Dextromethorphan/quinidine; Emotional incontinence; Pseudobulbar affect; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
24926198,Two cases of emotional disorder after middle cerebral artery infarction showing distinct responses to antidepressant treatment.,"Shimoda, Kengo; Kimura, Mahito",Shimoda,"Many emotional disturbances such as post-stroke depression (PSD) and emotional incontinence (EI) commonly occur following cerebrovascular events. The efficacy of antidepressants for these conditions has been established but their comorbid treatment has not been well characterized. In the current study, the authors describe two cases of post-stroke emotional dysregulation; one case with EI; and the other with EI complicated by PSD. The authors describe their differential responses to treatment. Case 1 developed EI after an infarct due to occlusion of the penetrating branches of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Case 2 developed both PSD and EI after right MCA stem occlusion. Both patients were initially treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine. Case 1 reacted promptly to SSRI treatment. However, Case 2 had only a partial response to paroxetine, even after many months of treatment. Adjunctive therapy with low-dose aripiprazole was eventually added, resulting in complete improvement of both EI and PSD after 2 additional months of treatment. Thus, Case 2 required a different treatment strategy than Case 1. These findings suggest that aripiprazole adjunctive therapy could be effective for some complex post-stroke emotional disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S63290,PMC4049429,antidepressants; aripiprazole adjunctive therapy; emotional incontinence; post-stroke depression; post-stroke disorder,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

A correlation between the clinical severity of pathological crying and the size of stroke-induced serotonergic pathway lesions is commonly accepted. We present a case of severe pathological crying after a limited left anterior choroidal artery territory infarction. A right-handed 55-year-old man who was a heavy smoker was admitted to the hospital after a right hemiplegia of sudden onset. Clinical examination revealed a right global hemiplegia including the face and a right hemihypoesthesia. Cerebral CT scan and MRI showed an infarct in the retrolenticular part of the posterior limb of the left internal capsule extending upward into the posterior paraventricular corona radiata region. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed an atrial septal aneurysm of 15-mm excursion without associated patent foramen ovale. From the first day of admission, the patient exhibited very frequent and intense fits of pathological crying. Their persistence led to initiation of treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine on day 30. Complete and immediate resolution of pathological crying occurred 24 hours after onset of therapy. Follow-up examination at day 90 confirmed the absence of relapse of pathological crying. We conclude that poststroke pathological crying in our patient may have been due to unilateral disruption of the capsular ascending projections of the serotonergic brain stem raphe nuclei. A small left-sided capsular lesion may have led to severe pathological crying. This disabling condition may be reversible with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor therapy.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.28.7.1464,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

To our knowledge, there have been few reports demonstrating diffuse white matter lesions in chronic CS(2) encephalopathy using brain MRI. In addition, the (99m)Tc-TRODAT-1 single photon emission computed tomography showed a normal uptake of the dopamine transporter, indicating a normal presynaptic dopaminergic pathway.

The authors present the case of a 76-year-old woman with no significant medical history who experienced pathological laughing after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of an aneurysm, which was successfully treated with craniotomy for aneurysm clipping. In the acute stage after the operation she suffered from severe vasospasm and resulting middle cerebral artery territory infarction and conscious disturbance. As she regained consciousness she was afflicted by pathological laughing 6 months after the onset of SAH. Her involuntary laughter was inappropriate to the situation and was incongruent with the emotional state, and she could not control by herself. Finally the diagnosis of pathological laughing was made and treatment with sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), effectively cured the symptoms. Her pathological laughing was estimated to be consequence of infarction in the right prefrontal cortex and/or corona radiata, resulting from vasospasm.

23100196,Selective TNF inhibition for chronic stroke and traumatic brain injury: an observational study involving 629 consecutive patients treated with perispinal etanercept.,"Tobinick, Edward; Kim, Nancy M; Reyzin, Gary; Rodriguez-Romanacce, Helen; DePuy, Venita",Tobinick,"Brain injury from stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) may result in a persistent neuroinflammatory response in the injury penumbra. This response may include microglial activation and excess levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Previous experimental data suggest that etanercept, a selective TNF inhibitor, has the ability to ameliorate microglial activation and modulate the adverse synaptic effects of excess TNF. Perispinal administration may enhance etanercept delivery across the blood-CSF barrier. The objective of this study was to systematically examine the clinical response following perispinal administration of etanercept in a cohort of patients with chronic neurological dysfunction after stroke and TBI. After approval by an independent external institutional review board (IRB), a chart review of all patients with chronic neurological dysfunction following stroke or TBI who were treated open-label with perispinal etanercept (PSE) from November 1, 2010 to July 14, 2012 at a group medical practice was performed. The treated cohort included 629 consecutive patients. Charts of 617 patients following stroke and 12 patients following TBI were reviewed. The mean age of the stroke patients was 65.8 years ± 13.15 (range 13-97). The mean interval between treatment with PSE and stroke was 42.0 ± 57.84 months (range 0.5-419); for TBI the mean interval was 115.2 ± 160.22 months (range 4-537). Statistically significant improvements in motor impairment, spasticity, sensory impairment, cognition, psychological/behavioural function, aphasia and pain were noted in the stroke group, with a wide variety of additional clinical improvements noted in individuals, such as reductions in pseudobulbar affect and urinary incontinence. Improvements in multiple domains were typical. Significant improvement was noted irrespective of the length of time before treatment was initiated; there was evidence of a strong treatment effect even in the subgroup of patients treated more than 10 years after stroke and TBI. In the TBI cohort, motor impairment and spasticity were statistically significantly reduced. Irrespective of the methodological limitations, the present results provide clinical evidence that stroke and TBI may lead to a persistent and ongoing neuroinflammatory response in the brain that is amenable to therapeutic intervention by selective inhibition of TNF, even years after the acute injury. Excess TNF contributes to chronic neurological, neuropsychiatric and clinical impairment after stroke and TBI. Perispinal administration of etanercept produces clinical improvement in patients with chronic neurological dysfunction following stroke and TBI. The therapeutic window extends beyond a decade after stroke and TBI. Randomized clinical trials will be necessary to further quantify and characterize the clinical response.",{},,CNS drugs,10.1007/s40263-012-0013-2,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",New Zealand,eng

A series of six cases of lightning stroke were studied. All patients had lost consciousness and reported amnesia of varying length. Assessment took place between one and four years after injury, ensuring that their neurological state had stabilised. They were tested with a neuropsychological battery with an emphasis on attention and memory. Personality and emotional reaction to the accident were assessed with questionnaires and a lightning fear scale. Complaints were recorded by means of a trauma complaints list including 10 questions on symptoms of the post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients reported fatigue and lack of energy as their main complaints. In addition, poor concentration, irritability, and emotional lability were mentioned often. Neuropsychological tests disclosed mild impairments in memory, attention, and visual reaction times. Two patients could be classified as depressed, and one of these also showed convincing signs of the post-traumatic stress disorder. As the lasting complaints and impairments could not be explained, for all six cases, as resulting from head injury concomitant with lightning stroke, cerebral hypoxia or a post-traumatic stress syndrome, it is concluded that lightning stroke can result in subtle cognitive impairments. It is speculated that most complaints of these survivors are caused by a vegetative dysregulation, a disorder that has often been noted in the literature on the effects of electrical injury to the nervous system. Such a dysregulation might cause both the main complaint of fatigue and the mild cognitive impairments identified with the present test battery.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.64.6.763,PMC2170121,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A pharmacological mechanism for the rapid amelioration of pathological affect by tricyclic medications and its possible relationship to the newly discovered descending motor systems of the brain that use norepinephrine and serotonin as neurotransmitters is offered.

According to literature, brain stem cavernous angiomas occur most frequently in the pons (60%), and equally in the mesencephalon (20%) and in medulla oblongata. In clinical evaluation the authors describe the successful removal of a mesencephalic cavernous angioma causing progressive neurological deficits and symptoms. The authors present a case of a 51 year old female, who had developed 1 year prior to her admittance: fatigue, weakness in the right upper limb and fingers, right lower limb ataxia. One month later, her lower right limb developed sensory deficits. The first neurological exploration indicated dysarthria, moderate facial and right hemiparesis, hemihypaesthesia and ataxia. CT and MR imaging indicated multilobulated cavernomas in the mesencephalon. After conservative treatment the patient became almost symptom free, and thus neurosurgical treatment was not discussed. Later on her symptoms fluctuated, but after 6 month she suddenly developed progressive right hemiparesis, right facial weakness, serious dysphasia, and emotional incontinence combined with continuous spastic sobbings. The control MRI showed enlargement of the cavernomas and new extravasation. Surgery was indicated for removing the cavernomas. The left infratentorial, supracerebellar approach revealed a blood engorged cavernoma in the center of the mesencephalon, almost dividing it. The cavernomas and accompanying haematoma was extirpated. The patient's neurological symptoms rapidly improved after surgery, her dysphasia as well as motor weakness have disappeared. Six days after surgery, we discharged a neurologically symptomless and self-supporting patient.

8575717,[Patchy changes in white matter in cranial computerized and magnetic resonance tomography--significance for (differential) diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type and vascular dementia].,"Stoppe, G; Staedt, J; Bruhn, H",Stoppe,"With the advancement of technical progress, especially with respect to magnetic resonance imaging, patchy cerebral white matter lesions (WML) are being found with increasing frequency. The (differential) diagnosis between the two main dementias of old age, (senile) dementia of the Alzheimer type ([S]DAT) and vascular dementia (VD) is made more frequently in favour of the latter, since the detection of WML leads to support a vascular origin for dementia. The present article reviews the literature concerning X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in these disorders. For comparison purposes some methodological problems must be taken into account including different scoring systems for WML severity, differences in imaging techniques and in the criteria for the selection of patients and controls. A great number of studies demonstrates a strong association of frequency and severity of WML with increasing age and presence of cerebrovascular risk factors such arterial hypertension. Some studies revealed an association with neuropsychiatric deficits including gait disorders, urinary incontinence, affective lability and reduced attention and information processing speed. In CT studies, about 30% of patients with (S)DAT had WML but 36-88% in MR studies. However, only few studies controlled for the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors. More recent studies - with improved techniques - revealed a higher frequency of (slight or moderate) WML in the (S)DAT group compared to controls. The prevalence of WML in VD patients was 75-97% in CT studies and about 100% in MR studies. Therefore, without the presence of WML, the diagnosis of VD is currently in doubt. A number of in vivo investigations proved consistently - and with different methods - that cerebral blood flow was reduced in WML regions. As shown in some studies the neuropathologic correlates of WML have in common that the relative tissue water content is increased: This includes inflammation, gliosis, complete and incomplete infarctions, dilation of the perivascular (Virchow-Robin) spaces with myelin atrophy. Thus the finding of WML in watershed areas can be understood. Three case reports serve to illustrate the problems pointed out. In conclusion, the occurrence of WML is an unspecific finding which is observed in up to 50% of the elderly. Diagnostic classification as ""vascular lesions"" or signs of ""vascular encephalopathy"" or VD based on CT or MRI alone, should not be made.",{},,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,10.1055/s-2007-996644,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Germany,ger

We reported patient (QX) who showed a severe deficit in conscious recollection, and behavioural problems (disinhibition, emotional lability) with relative sparing of familiarity-aware memory following a left mediodorsal thalamic lesion. More recent MR imaging has revealed that QX's lesions are more extensive than previously reported and involve both dorsolateral thalamic nuclei, and whilst there is evidence of left mediodorsal thalamic damage, it is not the main focus of damage. This paper reports a full analysis of QX's thalamic pathology alongside a more detailed investigation of his recognition memory, using yes/no and forced-choice procedures, and executive function. The results revealed impairments in yes/no recognition and conscious recollection rates of famous, artist and unknown names. In addition to the previously noted behavioural disinhibition and emotional lability, a deficit in spontaneous planning ability was evident on the Zoo Map Test (subtest of the Bahavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome). Forced-choice recognition, familiarity estimates and remote memory showed higher levels of preservation.

Symptoms such as euphoria, emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as organic personality syndrome according to the criteria defined in the DSM-III-R. It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome. Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns. Consequently, carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state. It may be attributed to the structural damage to the frontal lobe.",{},,The Japanese journal of psychiatry and neurology,10.1111/j.1440-1819.1990.tb01650.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

After remission for 6 years, his pathological laughing exacerbated in association with development of right hemiparesis. A new lesion in the left pontine base was demonstrated by MRI studies in addition to a few supratentorial lesions. Steroid pulse therapy was effective for both pathological laughing and right hemiparesis.

558537,[The combination of STA-MCA anastomosis with another operation for the occlusive cerebrovascular disease (author's transl)].,"Manabe, T; Kikuchi, H; Furuse, S; Karasawa, J; Sakaki, T",Manabe,"Case 1. A 65 year old male had left hemiparesis with sudden onset since 8 years ago, which gradually aggravated for these 2 years. On Sept. 27, 1973, he was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, Kitano Hospital. There was left spastic hemiparesis with hemisensory disturbance and he could not walk without help for the maked spasticity. Left carotid angiogram revealed the complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery and marked stenosis of the external carotid artery at the common carotid bifurcation. External carotid endarterectomy was performed on Nov. 19, 1973, which was followed by STA-MCA anastomosis 2 months later. The spasticity of extremities and left hemisparesis were gradually improved and he was able to walk without help. Case 2. On Apr. 14, 1974, a 63 year old female developed complete stroke with right hemiparesis and speech disturbance after transient ischemic attacks of 5 days duration. On Aug. 9, he was admitted and had emotional incontinence, right hemiparesis, Gerstmann's syndrome and motor aphasia. Left carotid angiogram revealed a saccular aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery and the occlusion of the distal middle cerebral arterys. These findings suggested that the occlusion was caused by embolus from the middle cerebral aneurysm, and the combined surgery with STA-MCA anastomosis and operation for the aneurysm was planned. On Aug. 30, 1974, under left frontotemporal craniotomy, aneurysmal neck clipping and aneurysmectomy were performed and thereafter, STA-MCA double anastomosis was done. One week after operation, the gradual improvement of pre-operative symptomes was noted. Recently, STA-MCA anatomosis is well known to be one of the effective operative methods for the occlusive methods for the occlusive cerebrovascular diseases and in addition, we found that the combination of STA-MCA anastomosis with other operations was effective for unusual cases presenting in this report. Furthermore, except for the occlusive cerebrovascular diseases, we usually plan STA-MCA anastomosis for the cases of 1) carotid ligation or trapping for carotid-cavernous sinus fistula and some internal carotid aneurysms, 2) some intracranial tumors with the danger involving the main cerebral arteries by operation to protect the cerebrovascular insufficiency.",{},,No shinkei geka.

Brain CT and MRI revealed multiple cerebral infarctions in the cortex and subcortical white matter of the right temporal and parietal lobes which were in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery. Cerebral angiography disclosed segmental narrowing (string sign) and two pseudoaneurysms in the right angular artery which were diagnosed as dissecting aneurysm of a branch of the middle cerebral artery. In this case, cerebral angiography was more useful than MRI in diagnosis of dissecting aneurysm of a branch of the middle cerebral artery.

She was healthy until 34 years of age when she had difficulty in walking and memory disturbance with personality changes. At age 36, she developed urinary incontinence and dementia. The neurological examination demonstrated euphoric mental state, emotional incontinence, severe dementia, paraplegia, dysmetria, choreic movements in both arms and urinary incontinence. Diffuse hyperreflexia and bilateral Babinski signs were observed. Routine laboratory examination showed slightly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and alkaline phosphatase. Electroencephalogram revealed diffuse irregular slow waves. X-ray film of the ulnar bone revealed osteoporotic and cystic lesions. The biopsy of the left tibial bone showed a specific membranous cystic structure. Computerized tomography (CT) of the brain showed symmetric, diffuse low density areas in the cerebral white matter and severe atrophy of the cerebellum. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse high intensity areas in the cerebral white matter. The present case is characterized by diffuse changes in cerebral white matter and cerebellar atrophy, which have been never reported in Nasu-Hakola disease.

9782541,Treatment of emotionalism with fluoxetine during rehabilitation.,"Tsai, W C; Lai, J S; Wang, T G",Tsai,"Emotionalism (emotional lability) is a common but distressing phenomenon that occurs frequently in individuals suffering cerebral vascular accidents and other brain diseases. Patients with emotionalism sometimes embarrass their families and themselves, becoming socially disabled despite normal physical function. At its worst, emotionalism interferes with rehabilitation programs, delays progress and sometimes makes these programs impossible. This paper reports the effect of fluoxetine in treating three patients with persistent emotionalism (2 cases following cerebrovascular accidents, 1 case following encephalitis). All 3 patients demonstrated dramatic improvement in emotionalism within 6 days of treatment. The severity, frequency and duration of each episode were reduced greatly. The treatment improved the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program, relieved patient and family embarrassment, and enabled patients to resume rapidly their previous lifestyle patterns. All patients reached the functional goals planned prior to the onset of rehabilitation. We conclude that fluoxetine is highly effective in treating the symptoms of emotionalism in all patients, and allows for recovery of both physical and social function.",{},,Scandinavian journal of rehabilitation medicine,10.1080/003655098444075,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Sweden,eng

On admission, the platelet count was 0.1 x 10(4)/microl, and the platelet-associated IgG level was elevated. Hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in a bone marrow specimen and aberrant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody patterns led to a diagnosis of EBV-associated idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Prednisolone (PSL) promptly restored her platelet count; however, she developed disorientation and affective lability soon after PSL was tapered. Subsequently, she ran a high fever and developed convulsive seizures. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated a high signal area in the subcortical white matter, and no abnormal findings were found on examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was made and steroid pulse therapy was started, which resulted in remission of the symptoms without recurrence in the following months. This is the first reported case of ADEM following EBV infection during treatment for ITP. Administration of PSL for ITP might mask the presenting clinical picture of ADEM.

Later, abnormal speech and behavior, emotional incontinence, anorexia and consciousness disturbance appeared. On March 19, she was admitted to our hospital in semi-comatose state. Myoclonus-like movement on hands was observed, and epileptic attacks with tonic and clonic convulsions occasionally occurred. There were no neurological findings that suspected cerebral focal lesions. The respiration was assisted through tracheal intubation. Laboratory examinations showed inflammatory reactions (CRP+2, WBC 10,600) and transient high levels serum CK (6,215 IU). As she had bradycardia (30-40/min) with complete AV block on ECG, the pacemaker was implanted. The complication of myocarditis was suspected. EEG showed bilateral slow waves (3-6Hz), dominantly in frontal areas. Brain CT and CSF examinations were normal. After the combined administration of ara-A, dexamethasone and anti-convulsant, the consciousness level was recovered within a month. The serum antibody against coxsackie virus B4 alone was significantly increased. We concluded that coxsackie virus B4 caused acute encephalitis with mental symptoms and myocarditis with AV block. Recently, cytomegalovirus was reported to be the causative virus in a young female with non-HSV encephalitis who showed mental symptoms with good prognosis, but coxsackie virus B4 should also be considered as one of the causative viruses.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
6743415,[Clinical studies on multiple lacunar state].,"Tashiro, K; Sawamura, Y; Matsumoto, A; Hamada, T; Moriwaka, F; Shima, K",Tashiro,"Sixty-five cases of clinically diagnosed multiple lacunar state have been analysed. The clinical course of multiple lacunar state is usually progressive in nature, simulating degenerative diseases, in contrast with the mode of acute onset seen in the other vascular diseases. Average age at the initial visit was 63.8 year-old, and sex ratio showed marked male preponderance, being 12 for males and 1 for females. Gait disturbance and speech disturbance are the most frequent initial symptoms, followed by slow motion, emotional lability and swallowing difficulty. Neurological manifestations are dysarthria, short-stepped and apraxic gait, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski and Chaddock reflexes, minimal spasticity, dementia, positive palmo-mental reflex, emotional lability, fixed face, rigidity, bradykinesia, foot grasping, dysphagia, positive Myerson's sign and tremor, in the order described. The important point is that the rigidity is paratonic and the tremor is action or postural, not the cogwheel rigidity or resting tremor like Parkinson's disease. The appearance of pathological reflexes (Babinski and Chaddock reflexes) are quite important, especially Chaddock reflex, which can frequently become positive despite negative or equivocal Babinski reflex. Hypertension, especially longstanding in nature, is the major contributing factor in this disorder. CT scan showed the presence of one or more lacunes in 52 out of 65 cases (80.0%). The detection of lacune can be influenced by the quality of CT scan, and the high resolution CT scanner is greatly useful for that purpose. It is stressed that the detailed neurological and computed tomographic evaluations will make it possible to reach the clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment of multiple lacunar state.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
