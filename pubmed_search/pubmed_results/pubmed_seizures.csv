23377484,Rasmussen's encephalitis.,"Dawodu, C O; Akinbo, D D",Dawodu,"Rasmussen's encephalitis is an uncommon chronic inflammatory disease disorder of unknown etiology. The aim of this report was to create an awareness of Rasmussen's encephalitis in our clinical practice in Africa. We searched online for literature on Rasmussen's encephalitis with an emphasis on documented cases in Africa and in blacks all over the world. Master F.M., a 14-year-old male, presented with history of recurrent seizures on three occasions. The first was after an upper respiratory tract infection, the second was a post-complicated meningo-encephalitis and the third episode was associated with receptive aphasia, hemiparesis and intellectual impairment. Neuroimaging studies revealed cerebellar atrophy and infarction of territory of the middle cerebral artery. His electroencephalogram showed bi-frontal theta activity left>right and poly spikes left>>right, diagnostic of complex partial seizures. In a period of 12 months, his gait and speech had improved while his intellectual impairment permitted re-admission into a lower academic class. He is presently on phenytion and prednisolone tablets only. Master F.M. had all the clinical features buttressed with neuroimaging results of a clinically probable Rasmussen's encephalitis. However, an advanced neuroimaging study is needed to detect and quantify hemispherical volume loss.",{},,Nigerian journal of clinical practice,10.4103/1119-3077.106780,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",India,eng
35630076,Wernicke Encephalopathy Mimicking MELAS.,"Finsterer, Josef",Finsterer,"a stroke-like lesion, the morphological equivalent of a stroke-like episode and the hallmark of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, have not been reported as manifestations of thiamine deficiency. a 62-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted after a series of epileptic seizures. Upon waking up from the coma, he presented with disorientation, confusion, confabulation, psychomotor agitation, aggressiveness, right hemianopsia, aphasia, and right hemineglect over weeks. Electroencephalography showed a questionable focal status epilepticus over the left hemisphere, responsive to lorazepam and oxcarbazepine. Follow-up electroencephalographies no longer recorded epileptiform discharges. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2-/diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in the left occipito-temporal region that was not congruent to a vascular territory which persisted for at least nine weeks. Since a lactate-peak could be seen in this lesion by magnetic resonance-spectroscopy, this was interpreted as a stroke-like lesion. Since thiamine was reduced, the stroke-like lesion was attributed to thiamine deficiency after the exclusion of differential diseases, including MELAS and status epilepticus. The patient's behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions largely resolved upon vitamin-B1 substitution. the case suggests that thiamine deficiency presumably causes mitochondrial dysfunction with cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis and a stroke-like lesion mimicking MELAS syndrome. It should be further studied whether nutritional deficits, such as thiamine deficiency, could give rise to secondary stroke-like lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58050660,PMC9144475,Wernicke encephalopathy; lactic acidosis; spectroscopy; stroke-like episode; stroke-like lesion; thiamine deficiency,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
15158704,Heraldic seizure.,"García-García, J; Calleja, S; De la Vega, V; Salas-Puig, J; Lahoz, C H",García-García,"The term heraldic seizures indicates epileptic seizures caused by cerebrovascular disease, believed to be triggered by silent ischemia and occurring before a stroke. This fact widens the spectrum of possible interrelations between epilepsy and cerebrovascular disease outside the well known context of post-stroke epilepsy. This is a case report of a healthy 67-year-old male who had a new onset epileptic seizure prior to a lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). This man began to suffer myoclonic jerks in his left arm which progressed to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. At the emergency area the physical and neurological examination were unremarkable and a CT scan was normal. The next day the patient developed left hemiparesis, hemianopsia and confusion and a new CT scan showed right parietal-occipital ICH. This case report exemplifies the concept of heraldic seizures, showing a patient who had a focal seizure preceding an intracerebral hemorrhage. Our etiologic diagnostic work led us to a diagnosis of probable amyloid angiopathy. We suggest that cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be the underlying cause, since it may be the origin of both the late event (ICH) and the heralding seizures, resulting from concurrent ischemia.",{},,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2003.08.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
38073163,Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Presenting as Simultaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; Aguilar-Fuentes, Victor; Benavides-Gómez, Fernando; Ruiz-Sandoval, José Luis",Jiménez-Ruiz,"A 37-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department with central facial palsy, ipsilateral right hemiparesis, and seizures. Brain Computed Tomogram (CT) showed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and bilateral frontal edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal hemorrhages consistent with a diagnosis of multiple simultaneous ICH (MSICH) (Figure 1). We suspected cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and performed a MR angiogram confirming this diagnosis (Figure 2). Upon admission, the patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and transitioned to direct oral anticoagulation at discharge. Non traumatic MSICH is a rare imaging finding with high mortality, usually arterial in origin (1). However, since treatment options vary, cerebral venous thrombosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in young female patients with known risk factors, such as pregnancy and puerperium (2-4). MRI modalities (Echo-GRE) are valuable tools in identifying ICH when CT is inconclusive (5).",{},,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,China (Republic : 1949- ),eng

A 14-year-old boy without any stigmata of neurofibromatosis type 2 presented intractable complex partial and generalized seizures since the age of 12 years. Neuroradiological studies showed an abnormal cystic mass with calcification in the left frontal lobe of the cerebrum. The tumor was located in the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex. The patient underwent surgical treatment because medical treatment with phenytoin and sodium valproate was not sufficient to control the seizures. An intraoperative electrocorticogram revealed that epileptic foci were recorded from the cortex, which was adjacent to the lesion. Histopathology showed specific features of meningioangiomatosis with meningioma-like nodules. The patient did not have any seizures with anticonvulsants after surgery. It is important to distinguish meningioangiomatosis from other possible cortical lesions and epileptic foci should be carefully considered before resection, because it is a benign and surgically manageable cause of seizures.",{},,Pediatric neurosurgery,10.1159/000094071,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
30327930,Perfusion-CT imaging in epileptic seizures.,"Strambo, Davide; Rey, V; Rossetti, A O; Maeder, Ph; Dunet, V; Browaeys, P; Michel, P",Strambo,"PCT is used in the diagnosis of acute neurological syndromes, particularly stroke. We aimed to evaluate PCT abnormalities in patients with acute epileptic seizures or status epilepticus (SE). We collected patients undergoing acute PCT for the suspicion of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), who received a final diagnosis of focal seizures or generalised seizures with a post-ictal deficit, with or without concomitant AIS. PCTs were retrospectively analysed for the presence of hyper- and hypoperfusion, and results correlated with delay from seizure onset, aetiology, type of seizures and the presence of electrical SE. Half of the 43 consecutively identified patients had regional PCT abnormalities-hyperperfusion in 13 (30%) and hypoperfusion in 8 (19%)-and 4 (9%) had AIS. Among patients with hyperperfusion, six (46%) had a focal deficit during imaging acquisition (two a normal clinical status, one altered consciousness and four ongoing seizure); nine (69%) of these patients had a SE; none had a stroke. All patients with hypoperfusion had focal neurological deficit; three (37%) of them a simultaneous ischemic stroke (in the remaining five, hypoperfusion was considered to be related to the seizure post-ictal phase). In the 22 with normal perfusion, 9 had a focal deficit (10 a normal clinical status, 2 altered consciousness and 1 ongoing seizure); 3 had a SE, and 1 had a stroke. Patients with SE featured a higher prevalence of hyperperfusion (9/13 [69%] vs. 4/30 [13%] without SE, p = 0.00). In patients with acute epileptic seizures, regional hyperperfusion on PCT may suggest an ongoing or recently resolved SE, whereas hypoperfusion may be due to post-ictal state or simultaneous AIS. These observations might help attributing focal deficits to epileptic seizures rather than stroke, allowing for targeted therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-018-9095-1,,Epilepsy; Perfusion imaging; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

12580716,Callosal neglect.,"Heilman, Kenneth M; Adams, David J",Heilman,"According to the interhemispheric inhibition model of neglect, the uninjured hemisphere inhibits (via the corpus callosum) the injured hemisphere but the injured hemisphere can no longer inhibit the opposite hemisphere, which becomes hyperactive and produces an ipsilesional attentional bias. Alternatively, according to the compensation hypothesis, the uninjured hemisphere helps compensate for the damaged hemisphere, which is impaired in directing attention to contralateral stimuli. If the inhibition model of neglect is correct, callosal disconnection should reduce neglect. If the compensation model is correct, however, it may increase or induce neglect. A 32-year-old woman, at age 14 years, developed a right frontal astrocytoma and was treated with surgery and radiation but had a cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to aspiration. Subsequent imaging studies revealed damage to the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions of the right hemisphere and damage to the temporal region of the left hemisphere. After discharge, she was able to return to school and drive a car, without any evidence of neglect. About 10 years later, she developed complex partial and atonic seizures that were multifocal and medically intractable. She underwent a complete section of her corpus callosum at age 31 years. One year after the callosal section, she demonstrated (1) diminished spontaneous saccades to the left, hypometric leftward saccades, and left gaze impersistence; (2) left arm hemispatial limb akinesia; (3) unilateral spatial neglect; and (4) motor and cognitive impersistence.

Postoperative complications may include facial nerve palsy, hearing loss, intracerebral haematoma, and brainstem infarction. The occurrence of intracranial cyst following MVD is extremely rare, with few cases documented in the literature. Herein, the cases of two patients with HFS who developed ipsilateral cerebellar cyst following MVD are reported. The first patient was a 50-year-old male presenting with a 6-year history of HFS on the right side of his face. MVD was performed, and 12 days postoperatively he developed dizziness and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a cyst in the ipsilateral cerebellum. Antibiotic treatment provided no benefit, and the cyst was drained. The second patient was a 44-year-old female presenting with a 4-year history of HFS on the right side of her face. MVD was performed, and 18 days following surgery, she developed dizziness and nausea. MRI showed an ipsilateral cerebellar cyst. Conservative treatment was applied and the cyst shrunk. At the 2-month follow-up appointment, symptoms were completely resolved in both patients. Cerebellar cyst is a rare complication following MVD.

In contrast, three dogs were presented with the history of chronic generalized tonic-clonic seizures and peracute deterioration with sudden onset of neurological deficits in accordance with an extensive unilateral forebrain lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the dogs revealed a well-delineated extraaxial T2W hyperintense mass in the rostral forebrain with homogeneous contrast enhancement. Additionally, an intraaxial, well-demarcated, unilateral lesion was apparent in the parenchyma supplied by the middle cerebral artery. In two cases, necropsy revealed meningothelial meningioma in the rostral fossa and marked eosinophilic neuronal necrosis, a sign of ischemia, focal malacia, edema and gliosis in the temporal lobe and hippocampus because of a focal thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery. In the third case symptomatic treatment resulted in improvement of clinical signs enabling a good quality of life for the patient. In dogs with structural epilepsy caused by meningioma, acute deterioration of clinical signs can be associated with ischemic infarctions as a potential complication.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC veterinary research,10.1186/s12917-020-02388-2,PMC7275618,Canine; Dog; Focal ischemia; Infarction; Meningioma; Vascular,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Repeat angiography was performed, demonstrating no intracranial vascular lesion recurrence. However, an incidental superficial temporal arteriovenous fistula was identified, which was not visualized on initial angiography assessing the prior AVM. These lesions have been treated successfully in the past with surgical, endovascular, or combined approaches. As this patient was scheduled to undergo cranioplasty following AVM resection, the decision to occlude the fistula surgically was made.

Understanding the characteristics of reflex seizures is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying network abnormalities in epileptic conditions. This report details a patient with medically intractable reflex seizures provoked by sensory stimuli to the patient's right foot. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during the seizure induced by sensory stimulation showed hyperperfusion in broad sensory-motor networks (dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, left thalamus, bilateral postcentral gyri and posterior parietal cortices, left supplementary motor area (SMA), and left paracentral lobule) and left caudateputamen. The irritative zones and ictal onset zone were localized to the left medial frontoparietal (SMA, anterior and middle cingulate gyrus, and paracentral lobule) and lateral posterior parietal cortices, as evidenced by amelioration of reflex seizures following intracranial electroencephalography and surgical resection of these areas. The neuroradiological and electrophysiological findings in our case study illustrate that the mechanism of reflex seizures may be associated with hyperexcitability of the broad sensory-motor networks, including the basal ganglia. Disconnection of these networks is necessary to treat reflex seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,NMC case report journal,10.2176/nmccrj.cr.2017-0031,PMC5629358,reflex seizure; sensory stimulation; somatosensory network; supplementary motor area,Case Reports,Japan,eng

The presenting complaint were recurrent episodes of short-term memory disturbance which manifested as isolated anterograde amnesia on neurocognitive evaluation. EEG and MRI revealed predominantly right frontotemporal spikes and a punctate diffusion-restricted lesion in the left hippocampus, respectively. Both symptoms and EEG changes subsided under anticonvulsant treatment with levetiracetam. Our report contributes to the current discussion of clinical challenges in the differential diagnosis of transient memory disturbance. It suggests that focal diffusion-restricted hippocampal lesions, as seen in TGA, might be ischemic and thus highlights the importance of considering post-stroke seizures as a possible cause of transient memory disturbance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02543-8,PMC8744318,Diffusion lesion; Ischemic stroke; Symptomatic seizure; Transient epileptic amnesia; Transient global amnesia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
22179485,Diffusion-weighted imaging for the differential diagnosis of disorders affecting the hippocampus.,"Förster, A; Griebe, M; Gass, A; Kern, R; Hennerici, M G; Szabo, K",Förster,"The human hippocampus can be affected in a large variety of very different neurological diseases, of which acute ischemic stroke, transient global amnesia, epilepsy, and limbic encephalitis are the most common. Less frequent etiologies include various infections and encephalopathy of different origins. Clinical presentation notably comprises confusional state, altered vigilance, memory deficits of various extent and seizures. While in hypoxic or hypoglycemic encephalopathy, clinical presentation and surrounding circumstances provide some clues to reach the correct diagnosis, in the above-listed more common disorders, signs and symptoms might overlap, making the differential diagnosis difficult. This review presents recent studies using the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technique in diseases involving the hippocampus. References for the review were identified through searches of PubMed from 1965 to January 2011. Only papers published in English were reviewed. Full articles were obtained and references were checked for additional material where appropriate. All pathologies affecting the hippocampus are associated with distinct lesion patterns on magnetic resonance imaging, and especially DWI has the ability to demonstrate even minute and transient hippocampal lesions. In acute ischemic stroke in the posterior cerebral artery territory, involvement of the hippocampal formation occurs in four distinct patterns on DWI that can be easily differentiated and correspond to the known vascular anatomy of the hippocampus. In the subacute phase after transient global amnesia (TGA), dot-like hyperintense lesions are regularly found in the lateral aspect of the hippocampus on DWI. The DWI lesions described after prolonged seizures or status epilepticus include unilateral or bilateral hippocampal, thalamic, and cortical lesions of various extent, not restricted to vascular territories. In limbic encephalitis, DWI lesions are only infrequently found and usually affect the hippocampus, uncus and amygdala. Furthermore, in some rare cases DWI lesions of different etiology may coexist. In patients with diseases affecting the hippocampus, DWI appears to be useful in differentiating between underlying pathologies and may facilitate a definite diagnosis conducive to an optimal treatment. With a careful clinical examination, experience with the interpretation of DWI findings and knowledge of associated phenomena, it is indeed possible to differentiate between ischemic, ictal, metabolic, and TGA-associated findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",10.1159/000332036,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

It rarely occurs without seizures. We conducted a literature review in MEDLINE about PRES during post partum and pregnancy, focusing on differential diagnosis and therapy. We reviewed 28 articles (case reports, original articles and reviews) describing PRES as well as a case of a severe, immediate postpartum HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet count) with PRES without generalized seizure. The development of PRES after delivery is unusual. Magnetic resonance imaging represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of this condition. White matter oedema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres is typical on neuroimaging. PRES is reversible when early diagnosis is established and appropriate treatment is started without delay. The pathogenesis of PRES is discussed and the importance of a prompt diagnosis is emphasized, as the crucial role of rapid blood press reduction. MRI is the diagnostic gold standard and it may be useful in the differential diagnosis. The goal of the therapy is to control elevated blood pressure and to prevent seizures or promptly manage it.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,10.1007/s00404-015-3800-4,,Eclampsia; HELLP syndrome; Hypertension; Imaging; Pregnancy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

We conducted a literature search in electronic database PubMed identifying studies reporting the overlap of PRES and RCVS. PRES and RCVS are two increasingly recognized entities that share similar clinical and imaging features. PRES is characterized by vasogenic edema predominantly in the parieto-occipital regions, associated with acute onset of neurological symptoms including encephalopathy, seizures, headaches, and visual disturbances. RCVS is characterized by reversible segmental and multifocal vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries and classically presents with thunderclap headache, with or without associated focal neurological deficits and seizures. PRES is frequently associated with uncontrolled hypertension but can also be seen in the setting of renal failure, exposure to cytotoxic agents, or pre-eclampsia. RCVS is often triggered by exposure to vasoactive agents, postpartum state, or immunosuppression. We report a case of a patient presenting with vision changes and hemiparesis, and found to have extensive cytotoxic and vasogenic edema involving the cortex and subcortical white matter on brain imaging. These changes were primarily noted in the parieto-occipital and brainstem regions, along with features of reversible vasculopathy on vascular imaging suggestive of coexisting PRES and RCVS. PRES and RCVS share precipitating factors, clinical and radiological features, and frequently co-exist, suggesting a common pathophysiological mechanism related to reversible dysregulation of cerebral vasculature, endothelial dysfunction, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2022.106472,,Cytotoxic edema; PRES; Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome; RCVS; Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome; Vasogenic edema; vasculopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A case of sudden death due to an epileptic episode after very mild head trauma is reported, including a retrospective study of 12 cases, to remind peers to pay close attention to CCT especially when located in important functional regions of the brain. After immunohistochemical staining and pathological examination, we speculated that the epileptogenic mechanism of CCT may be similar to that of hippocampal sclerosis. As the definite epileptogenic mechanism of CCT in the hippocampus is still elusive, we suggest that more research should be conducted on CCT.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",10.1007/s12024-018-0075-7,,Cerebral capillary telangiectasia; Forensic pathology; Hippocampus; Natural death; Temporal lobe seizure,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Baclofen overdose is a potentially deadly condition that can cause encephalopathy and can result from multiple etiologies. Renal disease can contribute to baclofen overdose and encephalopathy, and there are currently no dosing recommendations for patient's on baclofen with renal impairment. We report an unusual case of a man aged 35 years who presented with persistent fevers, seizures, and normal mentation. The patient presented with intrathecal baclofen use and prior exposure to West Nile Virus. He developed acute kidney injury at hospital secondary to vancomycin use, and mental status declined. This case highlights that patients with baclofen overdose can initially appear to have serious brain injury, however, full patient recovery can occur in <72 hours.

This creates a barrier to evaluate MS patients for epilepsy surgery. We present two cases of successful epilepsy surgery in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and stable MS and give an overview of the existing literature. (1) a 28-year-old woman with seizures arising from a right basal temporo-occipital ganglioglioma was seizure-free after surgery, without MS relapse but with one new MS lesion postsurgically. (2) a 46-year-old woman with seizures arising from a natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) lesion in the right frontal lobe was seizure-free after surgery preceded by extraoperative subdural electrocorticography, with new subclinical MS lesions. We are the first to report brain surgery in a PML survivor. Both patients stabilized radiologically after initiating second-line therapies. Successful epilepsy surgery can substantially increase the quality of life in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and MS. With increasing survival rates of brain tumors and PML, the risk-benefit ratio of epilepsy surgery compared to a potential MS relapse after surgery becomes critically important.

However, emerging evidence suggests it can be used for extratemporal lobe epilepsy as well.The authors report the case of a 17-year-old male who presented with refractory nocturnal seizures characterized by bilateral arms stiffening or rhythmic jerking lasting several seconds. Semiology suggested an epileptogenic zone close to one of the supplementary sensory motor areas. Electroencephalography showed seizures arising from the central region without consistent lateralization. Brain imaging showed no abnormality. An invasive evaluation using bilateral stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) was utilized in 2 steps, first to establish the laterality of seizures, and second to further cover the mesial cingulate region of the right hemisphere. Seizures arose from the middle portion of the right cingulate gyrus. Extraoperative electrical mapping revealed that the seizure onset zone was adjacent to eloquent motor areas. SLA targeting the right midcingulate gyrus was performed. The patient has remained seizure free since immediately after the procedure with no postoperative deficits (follow-up of 17 months).This case highlights the utility of SEEG in evaluating difficult-to-localize, focal epilepsy.

Patients were recruited from the emergency department, clinical consultation service and epilepsy monitoring unit of two tertiary referral centres. Patients underwent either 1.5T or 3.0T MRI with DWI, ADC, T2-weighted and post contrast studies during their acute admission and again after a period of follow up. Four patients were identified as having visible diffusion restriction and reduced ADC in one or both hippocampi and the splenium of the corpus callosum. These lesions either completely resolved, showed interval improvement or demonstrated atrophy on follow up imaging. The two patients with persisting abnormalities had presented with status epilepticus. These acute ictal imaging changes give clinicians an important in-vivo look at the dynamic neuronal metabolic environment in the peri-ictal period. Areas that appear most susceptible include the mesial temporal structures and corpus callosum. Close imaging follow up to document resolution or evolution of long lasting sequelae is vital. There is no clear consensus as to why some patients develop ictal related imaging changes and others do not.

We report a new case of this overlap syndrome and present a systematic review of similar cases in the literature to provide information on the clinical presentation, MRI features, EGG abnormalities, treatment, and prognosis of patients with this rare syndrome. A total of 12 patients were analyzed in the study. The most common clinical manifestations of FLAMES overlaid with anti-NMDARe were epilepsy (12/12), headache (11/12), and fever (10/12). Increases in intracranial pressure (median: 262.5 mmH<sub>2</sub>O, range: 150-380 mmH<sub>2</sub>O), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte count (median: 128×10<sup>6</sup>/L, range: 1-610×10<sup>6</sup>/L), and protein level (median: 0.48 g/L) were also observed.

Over a mean follow-up period of 18.5 months, only one patient experienced residual visual impairment, while the remaining 11 patients had good prognoses. FLAMES alone is difficult to distinguish from overlap syndrome based on clinical features. However, FLAMES with bilateral medial frontal lobe involvement suggests the presence of the overlap syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1149987,PMC10150000,FLAIR; MOG ab-positive CCE; anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis; demyelinating disease; symptoms,Systematic Review; Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

He also had episodes of losing consciousness, but had not sought treatment because of financial hardship. He was found in the ocean. Autopsy revealed foamy liquid leaking from his nose and mouth, and pleural effusions. The trachea and bronchi contained the same foamy liquid. The lungs were swollen and edematous, and leaked a large amount of foamy liquid. His cause of death was diagnosed as drowning. In the brain, the veins on the frontal lobe and the temporal pole, each on the right cerebral hemisphere, were dilated. A vascular lesion measuring 5 × 5 × 8 cm was found on the bottom of the right frontal lobe, and was located between the right middle cerebral artery and those veins. This vascular lesion extended to the brain parenchyma, and the basal ganglia of the right cerebrum was displaced outward and upward. The vascular lesions in the brain showed blood vessels of various sizes and shapes, and some of the vessel walls were thickened. The vascular lesion on the right frontal lobe was diagnosed as an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). According to the police investigation, the harbor where his body was found was a place he often came for fishing and walking. The possibility of suicide cannot be ruled out. Moreover, it was considered that his AVM might have rendered him unconscious, causing him to fall into the ocean.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.1016/j.legalmed.2022.102144,,Drowning; Epileptic seizure; Forensic autopsy; Giant intracranial arteriovenous malformation; Neuropathology,Case Reports,Ireland,eng
31753820,Hemiencephalitis: a hyperaemic presentation of Hashimoto's encephalopathy.,"Gregory, Timothy A; Jones, Gillian N; Loh, Yince",Gregory,"There are many examples in the literature of Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) presenting with heterogeneous manifestations to include stroke-like episodes, seizures, myoclonus and psychiatric symptoms. The pathogenesis is poorly understood but is thought to involve an autoimmune-mediated vasculitis. Here, we present a novel case showing hemispheric hyperaemia which created a diagnostic challenge and insinuated a vascular mechanism for the condition. The patient presented with left-sided stroke-like symptoms and had head CT angiography notable for asymmetric vasculature initially interpreted radiographically as decreased left middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow. An MRI brain demonstrated right-sided holohemispheric fluid-attenuatedinversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity with right insula contrast enhancement. She was found to have elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies with an otherwise negative encephalitis workup. The patient was diagnosed with HE and acutely progressed to have focal seizures during a prolonged intensive care unit stay. She ultimately required intravenous Ig and antiepileptic medications to gain control of her disease. This case appears to be the first described presentation of hemiencephalitis with local hyperaemia, and may represent local autoregulatory loss as a result of vasculitis. This supports the existing literature implicating inflammatory microvascular infiltration in the mechanism of the disease. HE must be considered in a broad range of unexplained neurological symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2019-230011,PMC6887381,immunology; neuroimaging; neurological injury; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Herein, we report the case of an adult patient with RE who was treated with a functional hemispherectomy and achieved a favorable prognosis. A 29-year-old woman presented with a 24-year history of epileptic seizures. Neurological examination showed hemiplegia, homonymous hemianopsia, and right muscular atrophy. Neuropsychological examination demonstrated cognitive disorders. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans showed progressive encephalatrophy in the left hemisphere and ventriculomegaly in the left lateral ventricle. The Wada test showed that the right hemisphere was dominant for language. A functional hemispherectomy was performed. Postoperatively, no antiepileptic drugs were administered, and the patient remained seizure-free without aggravation of hemiplegia. Over a 2-year follow-up, cognitive functions improved.

Piloerection is considered to be principally caused by temporal lobe activity although frontal and hypothalamic seizure origins have been reported. The described etiology has shown a wide variety of structural causes such as mesial temporal sclerosis, tumors, posttraumatic, cavernomas and cryptogenic epilepsies. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence of ictal piloerection in the clinical records of patients who underwent video-EEG monitoring (VEEGM) between 2007 and 2013 in a multicenter cooperative study. All patients presented refractory epilepsies and were evaluated with a protocol that included brain MRI, neuropsychology and VEEGM. A total of 766 patients were evaluated in four tertiary centers in Spain. Five patients showed piloerection as principal seizure semiology (prevalence 0.65%). The mean age at seizure onset was 39.6 years and the average epilepsy duration was 5.2 years (range 2-14) before diagnosis. Four patients were additionally examined with FDG-PET and/or SPECT-SISCOM. All presented temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), three right-sided and two left-sided. A typical unilateral hippocampal sclerosis was described in 3 cases. The etiology detected in all cases was limbic encephalitis. Three had LGI1, one anti-Hu, and another Ma2 antibodies. Our series describes a so far not well-recognized autoimmune association of pilomotor seizures to limbic encephalitis. This etiology should be ruled out through a comprehensive diagnostic work-up even in cases of long-lasting TLE with typical hippocampal atrophy on MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2014.04.013,,Autoimmune; Autonomic; Limbic encephalitis; Pilomotor; Seizures,Case Reports; Journal Article; Multicenter Study,England,eng

Surgical management of cavernous malformation (CM) of the insula consists of total resection of the lesion and the surrounding gliosis to avoid or reduce seizures. When located in the dominant hemisphere, an awake craniotomy with intraoperative mapping reduces the risk of functional damage. The insula is covered by the operculum and has a relationship with the middle cerebral artery and its branches that run along its lateral surface. Therefore high expertise is required to manage the exposure of the insula and its complex anatomy. This video demonstrates the surgical management of a large left insular CM. A 29-year-old female with multiple CM and 7 years of partial seizures and recent onset of short memory loss. Neuroimaging showed a large left insular and planum polare CM with important mass effect and hemorrhage signs. The patient consented to surgery, and an awake pretemporal craniotomy was carried out with continuous motor evoked potential monitoring. No language function was localized in the superior temporal gyrus; therefore corticectomy of the middle portion was performed to expand the operative corridor. The vessel manipulation during wide opening of the sylvian fissure increased the risk of postoperative vasospasm and blood drain into the surgical field. The CM was exposed and completely removed without functional damage. The patient recovered from surgery without complications, and no seizures occurred at 2 months' follow-up. Postoperative imaging showed complete removal of the CM.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.10.220,,Awake craniotomy; Cavernous malformation; Insular anatomy; Microneuroanatomy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Video-Audio Media,United States,eng

However, cases of rhabdomyolysis induced by a single seizure accompanied by viral encephalitis are rarely reported. Herein, we present a case of adult Herpes Simplex Encephalitis complicated with rhabdomyolysis. A 32-year-old male was patient presented with fever accompanied by episodes of convulsions, myalgia, and oliguria, which exacerbated the delirium. Routine blood examination showed impaired kidney function and elevated myoglobin (Mb) and creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels. MRI scanning revealed a damaged frontotemporal lobe and limbic system. In addition, herpes simplex virus (HSV) pathogen was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid thus indicating HSV infection. Therefore, a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis triggered by HSV infection accompanied by epilepsy was made. Notably, the patient recovered well after early intervention and treatment. The case presented here calls for careful analysis of rhabdomyolysis cases with unknown causes, minor seizures, and without status epilepticus.

We define stroke-onset seizures as seizures occurring within 2 hours of stroke onset. A 64-year-old woman presented with top of the basilar artery syndrome-thalamic infarction occurred first and midbrain infarction 12 days later. She manifested stroke-onset seizures during midbrain infarction, which was heralded by stupor. Within 2 hours of the onset of stupor, she had a clonic seizure of the lower extremities, electroencephalography (EEG) revealed nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and an episode of convulsive movements of all extremities was recorded on video and on EEG. Continuous EEG recording showed epileptiform discharges that would appear, disappear, and reappear over a 3-week period. It took 3 weeks and 4 antiepileptic drugs to fully suppress cortical hyperexcitability, perhaps because injury to some midbrain structures resulted in global lowering of the seizure threshold. The most important risk factor for stroke-onset seizures appears to be posterior circulation stroke, particularly brainstem infarction. The difference in risk profile between stroke-onset seizures and other forms of early-onset seizures suggest that their pathophysiology is not exactly the same. Focusing some of the research spotlight on stroke-onset seizures can help us better understand their unique clinical, electrographic, radiologic, and pathophysiologic features.",{},,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,10.1177/2324709620940497,PMC7357055,basilar; early onset; ischemic; midbrain; seizure; status epilepticus; stroke; thalamus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

11295998,Convulsive-like movements in brainstem stroke.,"Saposnik, G; Caplan, L R",Saposnik,"Involuntary convulsive-like movements sometimes occur in patients with brainstem strokes. These movements vary in nature, frequency, and trigger, including fasciculation-like, shivering, jerky, tonic-clonic, and intermittent shaking movements. Some are interpreted as decerebrate postures or seizures. It is important to recognize this type of motor phenomenon since it may be a diagnostic clue for early diagnosis and treatment of brainstem strokes. Case report and review of the literature A 72-year-old-man presented with impaired consciousness and jerks of the upper limbs mimicking seizures. These episodes consisted of brief clonic contractions of the proximal and distal upper extremities. They were observed in paroxysms lasting for 3 to 5 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging showed large midpontine infarction. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed the absence of basilar artery blood flow. No seizure discharges were observed in the electroencephalogram. Anticoagulation with intravenous heparin was started. Two days after admission, the patient had a cardiac arrest and died. We review the frequency and nature of convulsive-like movements in brainstem stroke in the literature. Movements associated with brainstem lesions are not easily differentiated from convulsions. Unexpected onset and inexperience of the observers limit the characterization of this phenomenon. Convulsive-like movements in brainstem stroke may occur more frequently than reported. Early detection of this motor phenomenon may have practical implications.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.58.4.654,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Enlargement of the right frontal lobe with increased volume of subcortical and deep white matter, as well as thickening of the ipsilateral genu of the corpus callosum was common. The onset of epilepsy was 4-7 years of age, with seizure types of massive myoclonus in two and generalized tonic-clonic in two, which could be eventually controlled by antiepileptics. Interictal electroencephalography showed frontal alpha-like activity in one, and abundant spike-wave complexes resulting in diffuse continuous spike-wave activity during sleep in two patients even after suppression of clinical seizures. Psychomotor development appeared unaffected or slightly delayed before the onset of epilepsy, but became mildly disturbed during follow-up period of 7-11 years.

Recently, seizures associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia have been found to be associated with subcortical T2 hypointensity on magnetic resonance imaging, especially in the occipital lobes. However, the mechanism remains unclear, although iron accumulation is suggested. We present a case of occipital lobe seizures associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia supporting the hypothesis that the mechanism of subcortical T2 hypointensity is iron accumulation using gradient-echo T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A 65-year-old Japanese man complained of intermittent pastel-colored flashing lights. On neurological examination, he also had lower right-side quadrant hemianopia. No other abnormal neurological findings were found. On laboratory analysis, his blood glucose level was 370 mg/dL, HbA1c was 11.4 %, and serum osmolarity was 326 mOsm/L. No ketones were detected in urine. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of his head showed subcortical T2 and T2* hypointensity in his left occipital lobe. Single-photon emission computed tomography with I123-N-isopropyl-iodoamphetamine revealed hyperperfusion in the left dominant occipital lobe. These magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities resolved during clinical recovery and treatment to control his blood sugar level. Therefore, a diagnosis of occipital lobe seizures associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia was made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of occipital lobe seizures associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia supporting the role of iron accumulation as a mechanism for subcortical T2 hypointensity using T2*-magnetic resonance imaging.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-016-1010-8,PMC4983053,Case report; Iron accumulation; NKH; Seizure; Subcortical T2 hypointensity; Subcortical T2* hypointensity,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The continuous use of MNZ causes various neurological symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, visual disturbance, vestibulocochlear symptoms, gait disturbance, dysarthria, and epileptic seizures of unknown cause, named MNZ-induced encephalopathy (MIE), in rare cases. MIE is a reversible disease that often improves within a few days of MNZ discontinuation, but irreversible neurological symptoms rarely remain. Herein, we report a case of MIE that developed during MNZ administration for a liver abscess, causing prolonged unconsciousness and death even after drug discontinuation. An 85-year-old female patient complained of fever, elevated liver enzymes, and a multifocal abscess in the right hepatic lobe, as seen on computed tomography. Percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage and antibiotic therapy were initiated. The causative agent of the liver abscess could not be identified, thus meropenem was started, which demonstrated no inflammation improvement, thus oral MNZ was added. The inflammation recurred when MNZ was discontinued, and the patient continued taking MNZ. Vomiting, upper limb tremors, consciousness disturbance, and convulsions appeared on day 46 (total dose of MNZ 73.5mg), and the patient was hospitalized. T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and FLAIR head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed symmetrical abnormal high-signal areas in the cerebellar dentate nucleus, corpus callosum, cerebral white matter, and periventricular areas. MIE was diagnosed based on the patient's course and MRI images, and MNZ was discontinued. The patient continued to suffer from impaired consciousness and convulsions after MNZ discontinuation and died due to aspiration pneumonia. Suggestively, MIE development is related to long-term MNZ administration, poor nutrition, liver disease, underlying diseases (such as advanced cancer), and serious complications. A systematic review of MIE cases revealed that 4.8-5.9% of the patients demonstrated little improvement of symptoms after MNZ discontinuation, and some deaths were reported. Patients with poor prognosis were often suffering from impaired consciousness and convulsions. Furthermore, impaired consciousness was the most common residual symptom. Abnormal signals in characteristic areas, such as the dentate nucleus cerebri and corpus callosum, on head MRI are useful for MIE diagnosis, especially in patients with abnormal findings in the cerebral white matter, which is associated with a poor prognosis.

There are no reports of cerebellar ischemia as an etiology of TGA. A 78-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes presented to the Ohio State University ER after a period of anterograde amnesia lasting 3 hours. She was alert during the event, but asked the same questions repeatedly. Upon arrival to the ER, she was hypertensive but clinically back to baseline, with no recall of the 3-hour time period. An MRI of her brain revealed an isolated hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at the junction of the superior cerebellum and vermis, with apparent diffusion coefficient correlation. Vascular imaging of the brain and neck and a routine EEG were unremarkable. We diagnosed her with cerebellar ischemia presenting as TGA. She had no head injury, migraine, or history of epilepsy to suggest alternative etiologies of TGA. An increasing amount of literature has reported that the cerebellum is linked to the limbic system. A case series of SPECT imaging on individuals with TGA revealed transient cerebellar vermis hypoperfusion in addition to hippocampal DWI changes. We present what may be a novel report of isolated cerebellar ischemia presenting as TGA, and we add to the literature for clinicians to consider the possibility that damage to the cerebellum or its circuit to the cerebrum or thalamus can present as TGA.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000287,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 53-year-old male presented with partial motor seizures. Imaging demonstrated a low-grade glioma affecting the posterior aspect of the superior and middle frontal gyri and invading the precentral gyrus. Preoperative motor Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and advanced diffusion tractography were performed to establish the relationship of the tumour with the motor cortex and corticospinal tract. Intraoperative motor mapping and monitoring were performed with monopolar stimulation (""train of 5"" technique). At the posterior margin of resection, subcortical stimulation demonstrated a selective response from intercostal muscles, medial to responses from the lower limb and lateral to responses from the upper limb. PubMed literature search was performed to identify any case reporting similar findings. There were no cases previously reported in the literature. The location of the subcortical response for intercostal muscles confirms the somatotopy of the corticospinal tract. Intercostal muscles are controlled by selective fibres within the corticospinal tract. Damage to these fibres can lead to paralysis of voluntary respiratory muscles. Further studies are needed to define the cortico-subcortical network controlling voluntary respiratory muscles.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-018-1796-9,,Corticospinal tract; Intercostal muscle; Motor cortex; Motor mapping; Subcortical stimulation,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

35773951,Diagnostic Puzzle of Acute Ischemic Stroke Mimics - Seizure Versus Post-Stroke Recrudescence: A Case Report.,"Akintomide, Femi Akindotun; Hosseini, Reza; Candale-Radu, Claudia; Khan, Khurshid",Akintomide,"BACKGROUND Focal seizure with impaired awareness, post-seizure Todd's phenomenon, and post-stroke recrudescence can all present with focal neurological deficits, mimicking stroke. As acute ischemic stroke mimics, they are distractors in the emergency setting where management is time-sensitive both for seizure and stroke. Nevertheless, a timely diagnosis can be made with exploration of the clinical features supported by investigation such as computerized tomographic perfusion. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 65-year-old woman who was known hypertensive, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous intracerebral hemorrhage with minimal right-sided residual deficits, but still able to ambulate independently. She was brought to the Emergency Department because 1 hour prior to presentation, she had sudden worsening of weakness of the right limbs, aphasia, aggression, and confusion. An initial impression of repeat acute stroke, focal seizure with impaired awareness, Todd's phenomenon, and post-stroke recrudescence was considered. While CT angiography was suggestive of left middle cerebral artery occlusion, CT perfusion revealed extensive hypoperfusion patterns beyond the region of the occlusion, thus suggesting a different etiology from acute ischemic stroke. In view of her previous left hemispheric lesion coupled with the presentation, our working diagnosis was seizure with Todd's phenomenon, and she was started on an anti-epileptic drug. Her condition returned to baseline within 24 h of admission and was subsequently discharged. CONCLUSIONS Our case demonstrates that adequate elucidation of clinical features in conjunction with CT perfusion, as a dual-purpose tool, can aid the diagnosis of both stroke mimics and acute ischemic stroke in the Emergency Department where rapid treatment is essential.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936826,PMC9253856,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
24618220,Subacute encephalopathy with seizures in alcoholics (SESA syndrome) revisited.,"Fernández-Torre, José L; Kaplan, Peter W",Fernández-Torre,"The aim of this paper is to describe two additional cases of subacute encephalopathy with seizures in alcoholics (SESA syndrome), and to propose that this entity now should be considered as a subtype of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, electroencephalography (EEG), neuroimaging data, and prognosis of these two further cases of SESA syndrome. In addition, we compare our findings with the cases previously described in the English literature in order to propose new diagnostic criteria. Two adults with history of chronic alcohol abuse were admitted because of confusion and seizures. A routine EEG showed frequent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) localized over the right temporal regions. In one case, we captured two complex partial seizures (CPSs) arising from the right hemisphere. Neuroimaging studies revealed subjacent chronic vascular pathology. Following transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), both improved to antiepileptic treatment and were discharged with full recovery. On the basis of our findings and a review of the literature, we suggest that SESA syndrome represents a subtype of partial or localization-related NCSE given its particular clinical, electroencephalographic, neuroimaging and prognostic characteristics.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2014.02.002,,Alcoholics; Complex partial status epilepticus; Nonconvulsive status epilepticus; Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges; SESA syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

This approach, however, may involve risks of neurological deficits when the residual AVM is in eloquent cortex. We present a case of complete thrombosis of a residual AVM after surgery. This residual AVM tissue was located in eloquent cortex. Complete spontaneous thrombosis of residual AVMs after surgery has only rarely been reported. This phenomenon raises questions regarding the most appropriate management for residual AVMs in eloquent cortex. The patient was a 43-year-old, right-handed, male patient with an AVM centered in the left precentral gyrus. The patient presented with medically intractable seizures and progressive right hemiparesis. After AVM resection, angiography revealed a residual AVM with early venous drainage. Angiography performed 1 week later demonstrated a persisting AVM nidus without early venous drainage. Angiography performed 3 months later demonstrated complete thrombosis of the residual AVM. The patient has been monitored for more than 1 year, without additional symptoms or therapy. We continue to advocate prompt return to the operating room when postoperative angiography reveals a residual AVM with persistent shunting. When the residual AVM is in eloquent cortex and is small, with a single draining vein, however, observation of the patient (with strict blood pressure control) and repeat angiography after 1 week represent an alternative strategy that is supported by this case report. As this case demonstrates, it is possible for small residual AVMs to thrombose. This may avert the need for reoperation for residual AVMs in eloquent cortex, with the potential for neurological deficits.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1097/00006123-200205000-00038,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng
25900411,Intracerebral Hemorrhage due to Venous Thrombosis of Developmental Venous Anomaly during Pregnancy.,"Seki, Morinobu; Shibata, Mamoru; Itoh, Yoshiaki; Suzuki, Norihiro",Seki,"Nowadays, developmental venous anomaly (DVA) is recognized as the most common cerebral vascular malformation. Most DVAs are diagnosed incidentally on routine brain imaging, but they are occasionally symptomatic. We report the case of a 26-year-old Japanese woman with intracerebral hemorrhage due to venous thrombosis of DVA. We examined her neurologic examinations carefully. We also observed her laboratory data, brain computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. She was 8 weeks pregnant and suffered from nausea, vomiturition, and appetite loss because of hyperemesis gravidarum. She presented with a sudden generalized seizure and was referred to our hospital. Brain CT showed a small hemorrhage and a tubular high-density structure compatible with an acutely thrombosed collecting vein in the right frontal lobe. T2*-weighted MRI also revealed a thrombosed collecting vein along with multiple medullary veins, which looked like caput medusa. She was diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage and symptomatic epilepsy secondary to thrombosis of the DVA. After the acute phase of the disease, systemic anticoagulation therapy was administered to the patient to prevent the recurrence of venous thrombosis. We suspected that hyperemesis gravidarum with intravascular dehydration might have increased the risk of thrombosis in this patient. Thrombosis of the collecting vein of DVA is extremely rare. This is the first report regarding DVA thrombosis during pregnancy, to our knowledge.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.03.035,,Developmental venous anomaly; hemorrhage; pregnancy; venous thrombosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Bloodwork performed during the initial seizure workup revealed hypercalcemia and hypercholesterolemia, which were attributed to vitellogenesis given the bird's previous egg-laying history and recent onset of reproductive behavior. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed diffuse right pallium atrophy with multifocal hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which were believed to be the result of the previous TBI. Findings were most consistent with post-traumatic seizures (PTS). Levetiracetam (100 mg/kg [45 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h) was initiated for PTS management. A 4.7-mg deslorelin implant was injected SC to suppress reproductive behavior. The bird was reexamined for presumed status epilepticus 5 times over 22 months. Seizure episodes coincided with onset of reproductive behavior. The levetiracetam dosage was increased (150 mg/kg [68 mg/lb], PO, q 8 h), and zonisamide (20 mg/kg [9.1 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h) was added to the treatment regimen. Additional deslorelin implants were administered every 2 to 6 months to suppress reproductive behavior. The owner was trained to administer midazolam intranasally or IM as needed at home. The treatment regimen helped control but did not eliminate seizure activity. The bird was euthanized 22 months after PTS diagnosis for reasons unrelated to the TBI or PTS.

9519401,Concussive convulsions. Incidence in sport and treatment recommendations.,"McCrory, P R; Berkovic, S F",McCrory,"Concussive convulsions (CC) are nonepileptic phenomena which are an immediate sequelae of concussive brain injury. Although uncommon, occurring with an approximate incidence of 1 case per 70 concussions, these episodes are often confused with post-traumatic epilepsy which may occur with more severe structural brain injury. The pathophysiological mechanism of CC remains speculative, but may involve a transient traumatic functional decerebration with loss of cortical inhibition and release of brainstem activity. The phenomenology of the CC is somewhat akin to convulsive syncope, with an initial tonic phase occurring within 2 seconds of impact, followed by a clonic or myoclonic phase which may last several minutes. Lateralising features are common during the convulsions. There is no evidence of structural or permanent brain injury on clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing or neuroimaging studies. Long term outcome is universally good with no evidence of long term epilepsy and athletes are usually able to return to sport within 2 weeks. The correct management of these episodes centres on the appropriate management of the associated concussive injury and the exclusion of other cerebral injury by medical assessment. The CC requires no specific management beyond immediate onfield first aid measures such as protection of the airway. Antiepileptic therapy is not indicated and prolonged absence from sport is unwarranted. These episodes, although dramatic, are relatively straightforward to manage and all team physicians and those involved in athlete care need to be aware of this condition.",{},,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",10.2165/00007256-199825020-00005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",New Zealand,eng

Because a diagnosis of antibody-related limbic encephalitis was suspected, studies including an autoimmune profile were done by cell-based assays.

Recently, they were detected in cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE), which often causes seizures. We performed a literature review to elucidate the electroclinical features of CCE. In addition to the published cases, we describe a new, illustrative case of MOG-Ab-associated CCE (MOG-CCE) with multifocal seizures documented by video electroencephalograph (EEG). We searched PubMed with the keywords ""[MOG] AND [encephalitis]"" and reviewed relevant articles. The articles included reports of patients with CCE (as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging) and serum MOG Ab positivity. Cases were excluded if no epileptic seizures were reported or if details of the seizures were unavailable. Our literature review identified 34 patients with MOG-CCE. An analysis of these 34 cases and the new case showed that 20 patients were male (57.1%), and the median age at presentation was 23 years (range, 6 to 46 years). Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure was the most common seizure type, followed by focal motor seizure in the face or an arm or leg. EEG findings were available for 26 patients.

We present a case of lesional mid-cingulate epilepsy confirmed by stereotactically implanted intracranial depth electrodes and subsequent surgical resection. Hypermotor symptomatology was seen during the first seven seconds of seizure onset while the seizure was still confined to the mid-cingulate gyrus contacts. The patient had brief contralateral clonic movements as seizure propagated to the primary motor cortex. There was a high concordance between the primary propagation contacts, as delineated by intracranial EEG, and the contacts, with higher coherence values in the connectivity matrix. Interestingly, cingulate-extra-cingulate connectivity and spread to the primary motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex was seen preceding spread to other cingulate contacts, of which one was less than 15 mm from the onset contact. This report is one of a few published, documenting propagation of seizures arising from the mid-cingulate cortex. As illustrated by these data, hypermotor semiology correlated with direct activation of the cingulate cortex. Subsequent seizure propagation activated an extensive extra-cingulate rather than an intra-cingulate epileptogenic network. Interestingly, had the region of onset not sampled, the seizure onset would have appeared as non-localizing widespread rhythms over the fronto-parietal convexities. Further studies to explore the propagation of seizures arising from the cingulate gyrus and the physiological and pathological connectivity patterns within the cingulate gyrus in humans are needed, preferably using stereotactic implantation.

32209081,Uni-hemispheric hyperperfusion in the early postictal state: case report.,"Velasco Gonzalez, A; Schülke, C; Buerke, B",Velasco Gonzalez,"In the emergency setting of acute ischemic stroke, seizures have been reported in up to 4% of patients. In the absence of arterial occlusion, seizures may also cause abnormalities in CT perfusion in 78% of cases when the time window from onset to imaging is short. Both hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion in the postictal state have been described. Also, though rarely reported, postictal perfusion changes can be uni-hemispheric. In these cases, perfusion maps should be analyzed thoroughly, since perfusion reconstruction software relies heavily on a ""normal"" contralateral perfusion status. A 39-year-old man was found on the ground with a minor head injury. On admission, his reactions were generally slow, but there were no other neurological symptoms, and blood pressure was low. The patient had a history of primary generalized epilepsy and admitted to dropping off his anti-epileptic medication. He was transferred to the radiological department for imaging but shortly before began to experience generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures which were brought under control by intravenous therapy with 10 mg diazepam. After approximately 15 min, a multimodal CT scan was performed, revealing marked changes in the perfusion of the brain hemispheres and posterior fossa, with sharp delimitation at the midline. Blood gas analysis was congruent with respiratory acidosis. Clinically, the patient remained awake without developing any new symptoms. He gradually recovered over the following 3 h and, against our medical recommendation, discharged himself from the hospital. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an early postictal state describing sharply delimited uni-hemispheric hyperperfusion and hemispheric alteration of the cerebellum with an equally split rhombencephalon.

A clinical case report].","Juiz-Fernández, A; Chavarría-Miranda, A; Prieto-González, A; Rodríguez-Osorio, X",Juiz-Fernández,"Psychiatric conditions are common in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. It can be extremely disabling, as it hinders the patient's integration into society. Emotional symptoms may occur during crises or can be chronic and not directly related to seizures. Some of the most common disorders are depression, followed by anxiety disorders and obsessive symptoms such as phobias. In the clinical case reported here, the patient suffers from drug-resistant focal epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety-depressive syndrome and phobias). In the pre-surgical evaluation, the origin of the seizures was established as the right mesial temporal region, and so surgery was performed. In check-ups, an improvement of both conditions was observed after surgery to treat her epilepsy. The activation of the amygdala and its interaction with different brain structures seem to play an important role in emotional learning and aversive stimuli, thereby conditioning (depending on its pattern of activation) the individual's ability to control their fear. There seems to be excessive activation in individuals with phobias. Surgical resection by anteromedial temporal lobectomy in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is an effective treatment to achieve control over refractory seizures, and may also help to ease emotional symptoms, thus adding an extra benefit. A pre-surgical evaluation with a multidisciplinary approach can be used to predict post-operative neuropsychological change.",{},,Revista de neurologia,10.33588/rn.7510.2022145,PMC10280768,,Case Reports; English Abstract,Spain,spa

DNETs are an uncommon, usually benign, glial-neural cortical neoplasm of children and young adults who typically present with intractable seizures. DNETs may occur in any region of the supratentorial cortex, but have a predilection for the temporal lobes. Accurate neuroimaging diagnosis is essential since patients with DNET benefit from complete resection. However, accurate differentiation from other cortical lesions may be challenging. Typical conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features can help in the differentiation from other similar cortical tumors. Diffusion tensor imaging can also provide important additional diagnostic information regarding the degree of involvement of adjacent parenchyma and white matter tracts. In this case, tractography and fractional anisotropy maps demonstrated that fiber tracts surrounding the lesion were displaced, but fiber integrity was maintained, which is more suggestive of a DNET rather than a more aggressive neoplasm. Accurate identification of DNETs is essential for the purpose of rendering a timely diagnosis and start appropriate treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of radiology case reports,10.3941/jrcr.v7i11.1559,PMC3888338,Diffusion tensor imaging; Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET); Neuroimaging; Tractography,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present an unusual case of CLIPPERS, in which a 29-year-old man initially presented with a seizure. Brain MRI revealed faint open-ring enhancements in the right frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy was performed to make a definitive diagnosis. Immunohistological tests showed perivascular infiltration by primarily CD3- and CD20-positive cells, albeit including a few CD68-positive cells, which confirmed a diagnosis of CLIPPERS. Both the symptoms and the MRI findings were markedly improved by 3 courses of steroid (methylprednisolone) pulse therapy, followed by oral steroid (prednisolone) administration. This case shows that CLIPPERS can present as a phenotype of cortical lesions and seizures as the first signs. A brain biopsy should therefore be actively carried out for differential diagnosis, especially when other, cortically based inflammatory disorders are suspected.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2018.01.017,,CLIPPERS; Cerebral lesion; Cortex; Interleukin 6; Pons; Seizure,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng

Six months before death, he received a second dose of mRNA coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. Three months before death, he experienced epileptic seizures for the first time. Seventeen days before death, he was infected with COVID-19, which showed self-limited course under home isolation. Several days before death, he complained of seizures again at night. Autopsy revealed multifocal gray-tan discoloration in the cerebrum. Histologically, the lesions consisted of active and inactive demyelinated plaques in the perivenous area of the white matter. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and microglial cell proliferation were observed in both white matter and cortex. The other major organs including heart and lung were unremarkable. Based on the antemortem history and postmortem findings, the cause of death was determined to be multiple sclerosis with suspected exacerbation. The direct or indirect involvement of cortex and deep gray matter by exacerbated multiple sclerosis may explain the occurrence of seizures. Considering the absence of other structural abnormalities except the inflammatory demyelination of the cerebrum, fatal arrhythmia or laryngospasm in the terminal epileptic seizure may explain his sudden unexpected death in the benign circumstances.

The patient's neurological deficits did not respond to L-dopa treatment and intrathecal administration of methotrexate (MTX). Two weeks later, he displayed confusion and generalized convulsions. T2-hyperintense lesions spread to the basal ganglia and the infratentorial regions. Gadolinium enhancement was observed in the cerebellum and frontal subcortex. DWI and the ADC revealed diffusion-restricted lesions in the middle cerebellar peduncles, left internal capsules and cerebral white matter. MTX pulse therapy and intrathecal administration of cytosine arabinoside and MTX were performed. Two months later, his ambulatory state was normalized. Brain MRI also revealed marked alleviation of the infratentorial and supratentorial lesions. The clinicoradiological profile of our patient suggested that dorsal ponto-mesencephalic lesions could contribute to the pathogenesis of PA. Physicians should pay more attention to striking CNS seeding of metastatic NKTL. MTX pulse therapy had an excellent effect in improving serious symptoms and brain lesions in our patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-11-137,PMC3214822,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In a retrospective observational study, we aim to identify the prevalence and characteristics of this syndrome, in addition to discussing the possible underlying pathophysiology. In a retrospective study, we reviewed records of consecutive adult patients (≥18 years old) who underwent cardiac and thoracic procedures at a single institution between September 2014 to September 2019 and found to have evidence of focal cerebral edema following their procedure. We included and reported clinical course of patients who developed post-operative neurologic dysfunction and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing (1) asymmetric cerebral edema with (2) cortical diffusion restriction and (3) T2 cortical or subcortical hyperintensity and (4) no proximal vascular occlusion. Three out of 107 patients (2.8%) met our inclusion criteria. These represented one male and two females with age at presentation of 63, 81 and 69, respectively. All patients developed severe neurologic impairment on the same day following their procedure (sternotomy with valve or bypass surgery in 2 patients; esophageal dilatation procedure in 1 patient). All patients underwent MRI of the brain and vessel imaging qualifying our inclusion criteria. Two patients improved neurologically prior to discharge, and one patient expired after family elected to withdraw care. We present a series of cases with a rare syndrome after cardiac and thoracic interventions. Although the exact mechanism of this syndrome remains unclear, we believe it to be related to relative cerebral hyperperfusion and cerebral dysautoregulation following anesthesia and thoracic manipulation. Future studies should focus on understanding the true prevalence and pathophysiology of this syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105003,,Cardiothoracic surgery; Cerebral edema; Cerebral hyperperfusion; Seizures; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article; Observational Study,United States,eng

All patients with common trunk anomaly associated with hemifacial spasm who received surgical treatment between 2006 and 2015 in our institution were identified in our prospectively collected database. Detection of the common trunk anomaly was performed using the intraoperative high-definition endoscopic inspection and confirmed by a retrospective review of the obtained operative videos. Out of 248 cases of hemifacial spasm, 21 cases with a common trunk anomaly were detected, with an incidence rate of 8.5%. In 6 cases, the spasm was caused by more than 1 offending vessel ""complex compression."" In 19 cases, total recovery occurred on follow-up, while in 1 case, 90% recovery occurred. One patient was spasm-free immediately after surgery, but died 3 wk after operation from herpes encephalitis. Common trunk anomaly in hemifacial spasm is rare. The surgical technique is mostly identical to decompression with normally arising vessels. However, in case of a bifurcation situated close to the compression site where the offending vessel cannot be transposed freely, an extensive cushioning along the trunk and the offending vessels with teflon pledgets should be performed.

Focal or generalized seizures followed by hemiparesis, aphasia, hemianopia, or other focal neurologic dysfunction in the absence of signs of increased intracranial pressure should suggest this possibility. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI) shows an ischemic lesion that does not follow the boundary of arterial territories and often has a hemorrhagic component, without signs of venous sinus thrombosis. Conventional angiography demonstrates no arterial occlusion but may show cortical vein thrombosis corresponding to the infarct, although these may also be nonspecific findings.

18167175,"A practical overview of tizanidine use for spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury.","Kamen, Leonard; Henney, Herbert R; Runyan, Jacob D",Kamen,"Tizanidine is an imidazoline central alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist widely used to manage spasticity secondary to conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI). While there is widespread use of tizanidine in clinical practice, little practical information is available to assist prescribers with the effective use of tizanidine for spasticity management. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of tizanidine and its use in the management of spasticity associated with acquired (SCI), static (stroke), and progressive neurological (MS) diseases. An unfiltered literature search of the term 'tizanidine' was undertaken on the Medline database resulting in 311 papers. As the review focused on tizanidine clinical pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability, with comparisons limited to the oral antispastic agents baclofen, diazepam, and dantrolene, 53 articles were selected for detailed assessment. Tizanidine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, is a short-acting drug with larger interpatient variability, and linear pharmacokinetics that is dosage form-dependent. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the efficacy of tizanidine is comparable to that of baclofen or diazepam with global tolerability data favoring tizanidine. A clinical case presentation demonstrated the effective use of tizanidine in combination with baclofen as a logical avenue for improved spasticity control. There is a large body of evidence for the effective use of tizanidine monotherapy in the management of spasticity. A case study demonstrates that combination therapy can effectively control spasticity while better managing dose-dependent adverse events, although additional studies need to be performed to confirm these results.",{},,Current medical research and opinion,10.1185/030079908x261113,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

Herein, we present a rare case of a 40-year-old woman with ICVT and type II protein S (PS) deficiency, who experienced a stroke. She initially presented with generalized convulsions. A CT scan showed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left temporoparietal region. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated and she went into a coma approximately 20 h after admission. A second CT scan revealed significant ICH expansion and transfalcine herniation.

The neurosurgical approach to the subcallosal region is challenging due to its deep location and close relationship with important vascular structures. Anterior and inferior routes to the subcallosal region have been described but risk damaging the branches of the anterior cerebral artery. METHODS Three formalin-fixed and silicone-injected adult cadaveric heads were studied to demonstrate the relationships between the transventricular surgical approach and the subcallosal region. The surgical, clinical, and radiological history of a 39-year-old man with a subcallosal cavernous malformation was retrospectively used to document the neurological examination and radiographic parameters of such a case. RESULTS The contralateral anterior interhemispheric-transcallosal-transrostral approach provides access to the subcallosal area that also includes the inferior portion of the pericallosal cistern, lamina terminalis cistern, the paraterminal and paraolfactory gyri, and the anterior surface of the optic chiasm. The approach avoids the neurocritical perforating branches of the anterior communicating artery. CONCLUSIONS The contralateral anterior interhemispheric-transcallosal-transrostral approach may be an alternative route to subcallosal area lesions, with less risk to the branches of the anterior cerebral artery, particularly the anterior communicating artery perforators.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2017.4.JNS16951,,ACA = anterior cerebral artery; ACoA = anterior communicating artery; anatomy; cavernous malformation; corpus callosum; interhemispheric transcallosal; subcallosal region; surgical approach; surgical technique,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

One year after the diagnosis, he developed fever and chest pain that required hospitalization. At admission, he was in shock, and chest computed tomography revealed invasion of the left atrium and left main bronchus by the hilar cancer. Chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed small low-density areas within the tumor and around the intestinal membrane, which were interpreted as the presence of air due to invasion of the lung cancer. He was diagnosed with septic shock due to necrotic infection secondary to cancer invasion into the left atrium. The following day, he complained of difficulty in speaking and weakness in the left side of his body. A head computed tomography scan revealed multiple small low-density areas in the right cortex and bilateral subcortex, which were interpreted as air emboli. On day 3, he experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures for approximately 1 minute, followed by myoclonus-like convulsions in the left lower limb and a right-sided gaze. The electroencephalogram findings after the convulsive seizures revealed partial epilepsy-like waves with intermittent spikes in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and a diffuse slow wave in the left frontal lobe. He recovered from sepsis without recurrence of convulsive seizures; however, he died of hemoptysis on day 50 after discharge. Electroencephalogram findings of focal spike activities and diffuse slow waves were detected in early seizures due to cerebral arterial air embolism of noniatrogenic etiology associated with lung cancer. Additional case descriptions are warranted to establish patterns in electroencephalogram findings specific to cerebral arterial air embolism.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-022-03300-2,PMC8962241,Cerebral arterial air embolism; Electroencephalography; Lung cancer; Seizure,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To describe the first use of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in a patient with a bilateral RNS implant to ablate the predominant temporal lobe and help control seizures. A 55-year-old woman treated for temporal lobe epilepsy with conflicting information regarding lateralization underwent RNS implantation. She was then discovered to have seizures with electrographic onset nearly all from the right amygdala and hippocampus. She was offered LITT to ablate the affected region in the right temporal lobe, followed by reimplantation of the RNS lead in the remnant of the right hippocampal tail. Despite the positioning of the RNS ferrule on the operative side and the depth electrode in the contralateral lobe, we observed no significant artifact and obtained stable LITT temperature mapping using magnetic resonance. Laser ablation and RNS device replacement proceeded without complications. The patient has remained seizure-free for 6 months since the ablation in the setting of weaning antiseizure medications and regaining ambulation. LITT ablation can safely and effectively be performed in a patient with a concurrent RNS implant. Maintenance of the RNS device after ablation allows for continual detection and management of seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",10.1227/ons.0000000000000429,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

24887055,Early and widespread injury of astrocytes in the absence of demyelination in acute haemorrhagic leukoencephalitis.,"Robinson, Christopher A; Adiele, Reginald C; Tham, Mylyne; Lucchinetti, Claudia F; Popescu, Bogdan F G H",Robinson,"Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL) is a fulminant demyelinating disease of unknown etiology. Most cases are fatal within one week from onset. AHL pathology varies with the acuteness of disease. Hemorrhages, vessel fibrinoid necrosis, perivascular fibrin exudation, edema and neutrophilic inflammation are early features, while perivascular demyelination, microglial foci and myelin-laden macrophages appear later. Reactive astrocytosis is not present in early hemorrhagic non-demyelinated lesions, but is seen in older lesions. This case report presents the pathology of an AHL case with fulminant course and fatal outcome within 48 hours from presentation. Severe hemorrhages, edema and neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of circumscribed perivascular demyelination affected the temporal neocortex and white matter, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and white matter, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, brainstem, cranial nerve roots and leptomeninges. Perivascular end-feet and parenchymal processes of astrocytes exhibited impressive swelling in haemorrhagic but non-demyelinated white matter regions. Astrocytes were dystrophic and displayed degenerating processes. Astrocytic swellings and remnants were immunoreactive for aquaporin-4, aquaporin-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These morphological changes of astrocytes consistent with injury were also observed in haemorrhagic and normal appearing cortex. Our findings reinforce that perivascular demyelination is not present early in AHL. This is the first study that highlights the early and widespread astrocytic injury in the absence of demyelination in AHL, suggesting that, similarly to neuromyelitis optica and central pontine myelinolysis, demyelination in AHL is secondary to astrocyte injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Acta neuropathologica communications,10.1186/2051-5960-2-52,PMC4035095,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Transtentorial approaches provide numerous advantages over transcortical approaches, including obviating the need to traverse eloquent cortex, not requiring parenchymal retraction, and circumventing critical vascular structures. All of these approaches require a tentorial opening, and numerous techniques for retraction of the incised tentorium have been described, including sutures, fixed retractors, and electrocautery. However, all of these techniques have considerable drawbacks and limitations. The authors describe a novel application of clip retraction of the tentorium to the supracerebellar approaches in which an aneurysm clip is used to suspend the tentorial flap, and an illustrative case is provided. Clip retraction of the tentorium is an efficient, straightforward adaptation of an established technique, typically used for subtemporal approaches, that improves visualization and surgical ergonomics with little risk to nearby venous structures. The authors find this technique particularly useful for the contralateral SCTT approaches.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2020.2.JNS192952,,cavernous malformation; supracerebellar infratentorial approach; supracerebellar transtentorial approach; surgical technique; tentorium; vascular disorders,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a therapy for epilepsy that has previously demonstrated alteration in regional cerebral blood flow on functional neuroimaging. We describe the peri-ictal DWI abnormalities in a patient with status epilepticus. A 21-year-old woman with pharmacoresistant localization-related epilepsy was treated with VNS and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with DWI for clinical purposes. Transient and reversible hyperintense signal abnormalities were noted on DWI at the site of seizure onset, in addition to the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. A concomitant decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient mimicked ischemia, yet complete clinical, and electrographic resolution occurred following successful termination of status. High-energy brain MRI sequences using DWI were safely performed in our epilepsy patient with a vagus nerve stimulator who experienced status epilepticus. This case highlights the bilateral and robust involvement of subcortical structures present immediately following status epilepticus. Additionally, bilateral abnormalities in the thalamus and midbrain in addition to the region of seizure origin, were observed in our patient implanted with a vagus nerve stimulator. Modulation of regional cerebral blood flow is one potential mechanism of action for VNS in humans; therefore, these regions of involvement could reflect the effects of status epilepticus, activation or facilitation by VNS, or both.",{},,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,10.1016/j.yebeh.2004.02.009,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,United States,eng

Intraoperative localization of eloquent motor and language cortex was achieved in each patient by using a combination of somatosensory evoked potentials and electrocortical stimulation mapping. Location of tumor and extent of resection was examined with magnetic resonance imaging.

The patient began to have refractory seizures at the age of 14, and preoperative MRI revealed left amygdala enlargement and left hippocampal atrophy. Other examinations were consistent with left mesial temporal epileptogenicity. He underwent surgical resection and achieved seizure freedom. Histopathological study of the amygdala showed swollen neurons with relatively large bodies and thick neurites, accompanied by vacuolar degeneration in the background. Additionally, there were marked clusters of OLCs with round nuclei and densely stained chromatin around the uncus. The OLCs were Olig2-positive.

24438798,Atypical cerebral language dominance in a right-handed patient: An anatomoclinical study.,"De Witte, Elke; Van Hecke, Wim; Dua, Guido; De Surgeloose, Didier; Moens, Maarten; Mariën, Peter",De Witte,"Approximately 97% of the right-handers has left hemisphere language dominance. Within the language dominant hemisphere Broca's area is of crucial importance for a variety of linguistic functions. As a result, tumour resection in and around Broca's area is controversial. However, studies showed that by means of Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) tumour resection in this region can be safely performed. We report unexpected anatomoclinical findings in a right-handed patient who underwent tumour resection in the left prefrontal lobe. Language functions in this right-handed patient were extensively examined in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phase by means of a standardised battery of neurolinguistic and neurocognitive tests. Results obtained in the pre- and postoperative phase are compared. In addition, intraoperative DES findings and postoperative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) results are reported. Tumour resection near Broca's area was safely performed since no positive language sites were found during intraoperative DES. Since no linguistic deficits occurred in the pre-, intra-, or postoperative phase, atypical language dominance was suspected. Neuropsychological investigations, however, disclosed permanent executive dysfunction. Postoperative fMRI and DTI confirmed right cerebral language dominance as well as a crossed cerebro-cerebellar functional link with the left cerebellar hemisphere. Atypical right hemisphere language dominance in this right-handed patient is reflected by: (1) the total absence of language problems in the pre-, intra- and postoperative phase, (2) absence of positive stimulation sites during DES, (3) a clearly more pronounced arcuate fasciculus in the right cerebral hemisphere (DTI), (4) a crossed functional connection between the right cerebrum and the left cerebellum (fMRI). Two hypothetical explanations for the pattern of crossed cerebral language dominance are put forward: (1) preoperative brain plasticity mechanisms inducing a shift of language functions to the right hemisphere or (2) right hemisphere language dominance as a maturational variant. This case with atypical cerebral language dominance shows that although DES is the 'gold standard' to identify eloquent language regions and their pathways, fMRI and DTI are important adjuncts to guide surgery, to identify language lateralisation and to study anatomoclinical correlations.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2013.11.014,,Atypical language dominance; Awake craniotomy; Broca's area; Crossed dominance; Direct Electrical Stimulation; Language mapping; fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

According to previous reports, this condition may be associated with antiepileptic drug use or withdrawal. We herein report a case of reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with oxcarbazepine withdrawal. Case Report A 39-year-old man presented with an 8-year history of epileptic seizures. During the previous 3 years, he had taken oxcarbazepine irregularly. One week prior to admission, he withdrew the oxcarbazepine on his own, and the epilepsy became aggravated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an isolated lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum with slight hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging and slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging. Regular oxcarbazepine was prescribed. Over a 5-month follow-up period, repeat MRI showed that the abnormal signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum had completely disappeared. Conclusion Reversible splenial lesion syndrome is a rare clinicoradiological disorder that can resolve spontaneously with a favorable outcome.

Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all the patients and plaques consistent with multiple sclerosis were identified. In two patients the plaques were seen in the area of the facial nucleus on the involved side. We suggest that hemifacial spasm can be a manifestation of multiple sclerosis. These cases illustrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of hemifacial spasm.

37008646,Rapport de cas Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings in a dog with suspected intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Kerbrat-Copy, Réjane; Jossier, Renaud; Fusellier, Marion",Kerbrat-Copy,"A 1-year-old, intact female, mixed-breed dog (border collie and springer spaniel) was initially evaluated for lethargy, fever, and ataxia and subsequently evaluated 2.5 y later following the onset of seizures. Over a 3-year interval, the dog underwent 3 computed tomography (CT) and 1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. A voluminous hyperattenuating lesion with a mass effect, exhibiting weak postcontrast enhancement and associated with surrounding diffuse parenchymal hypoattenuation, was observed in the first CT examination (3 d after initial clinical signs). The second CT examination (11 d later) revealed a hypoattenuating lesion with ring postcontrast enhancement. A clear reduction of the size of the mass, which presented as hyperattenuating with a severely postcontrast-enhanced center, was noted in the third CT examination (2.5 y after initial clinical signs and 3 mo after onset of seizures). The MRI examination, performed 3 mo after the third CT examination, showed a small lesion, T2*-gradient echo hypointense, with no peripheral halo noted in T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and with serpentiform enhancement from within the lesion to the meningeal region. These sequential imaging findings were consistent with intracerebral hemorrhage. Key clinical message: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of hyperthermia associated with intracerebral hemorrhage in a dog, although this is a common finding in human medicine. An intracerebral hemorrhage should be included in the differential diagnosis of an intracerebral mass, and performing sequential imaging examinations can help clarify the diagnosis.",{},,The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,,PMC10031785,,Case Reports,Canada,eng

An 84-year-old female was admitted with a diagnosis of PRES in the setting of malignant hypertension. The clinical course was further complicated by ischemic stroke and seizures. Contrast enhanced fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) studies revealed diffuse enhancement within the subarachnoid space extending to regions without evidence of cytotoxic or vasogenic edema. These findings suggestive of increased permeability were not only confined to the blood-brain-barrier, but also involved the blood-retina-barrier interface. Our observations suggest that pathologic conditions that disrupt the integrity of blood-brain-barrier might concomitantly affect retinal microcirculation, which highly resembles cerebral microcirculation both anatomically and functionally. Imaging modalities sensitive for detection of blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, such as contrast enhanced FLAIR, might be helpful in identifying these abnormalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2014.08.035,,Blood brain barrier; Ischemic stroke; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Retina; Seizure,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
38057112,[A Surgical Case of Hemifacial Spasm Due to Tentorial Meningioma -peritorcular type- in Posterior Fossa].,"Hashida, Atsutomo; Takeda, Yasushi; Kiyono, Junpei; Ohta, Hirotsugu; Yamamoto, Junkoh",Hashida,"Hemifacial spasm is commonly caused by compression of the facial nerve due to overlying vessels, and also due to various types of tumor or aneurysm, and other factors. It occurs, although rarely, as a secondary effect of cerebellar or brainstem shift resulting from a tumor. In such a case, the presence of a large tumor often leads to additional neurological deficits. We present a case of hemifacial spasm caused by a peritorcular type of large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa. A 68-year-old woman presented with right facial numbness 4 months ago and right hemifacial spasm 2 weeks ago. Upon visiting our hospital, she displayed no neurological deficits other than the right hemifacial spasm. MRI revealed a peritorcular type of large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa with perifocal edema. The right cerebellopontine cistern was narrowed, and the cerebellar tonsil was herniated. The right facial nerve ran adjacent to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). Angiography showed that only the left posterior meningeal artery (PMA) flowed to the tumor. The loop of the right AICA extended into the right cerebellopontine cistern. After embolization of the PMA, the tumor was surgically removed, leading to an improvement in the patient's hemifacial spasm. Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tentorial meningioma without any contact with the right facial nerve. The hemifacial spasm was caused secondarily by the cerebellar or brainstem shift due to the large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa. This large tumor had not produced any other neurological deficits before the hemifacial spasm appeared. We report this case because it is extremely rare.",{},,Journal of UOEH,10.7888/juoeh.45.237,,hemifacial spasm; peritorcular typ; posterior fossa; tentorial meningioma,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

10193623,Complex right hemisphere developmental venous anomaly associated with multiple facial hemangiomas. Case report.,"Aagaard, B D; Song, J K; Eskridge, J M; Mayberg, M R",Aagaard,"Complex developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) represent variations of normal cerebral venous drainage and consist of dilation of the superficial and/or deep venous system. These rare anomalies can occur unilaterally or bilaterally, supratentorially or infratentorially, focally or they can affect the entire hemisphere. Some DVAs are associated with cervicofacial venous malformations or facial lymphatic malformations. Anomalies of this type are generally clinically silent, and cerebral dysfunction is usually absent. Symptoms, when they occur, are most commonly headache or mild seizure disorders. The angiographic findings are striking, with well-formed but enlarged transcerebral medullary and deep and/or superficial cortical veins. Opacification of these venous structures occurs within the same time frame as a normal angiographic venous phase. The authors report the case of a 33-year-old man in whom a large inoperable arteriovenous malformation had been previously diagnosed and who presented with seizures. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated abnormally dilated transcerebral, superficial, and deep venous structures involving the entire right hemisphere with no identifiable nidus. Additionally, multiple bilateral benign facial hemangiomas were present in this patient. It is important to recognize this rare venous appearance as a developmental variant and not mistake it for an arteriovenous malformation or a partially thrombosed vein of Galen malformation. Because these venous anomalies are extreme variants of the normal venous system, hemorrhage rarely, if ever, occurs and the patient can be reassured that no interventional or surgical therapy is necessary or warranted.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.1999.90.4.0766,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

They had gross pathological lesions such as a tumor (one epidermoid, one neurinoma, and two meningiomas), vascular malformation (one medullary venous malformation and two arteriovenous malformations), and aneurysm. In all four cases with a tumor, no artery compressed the facial nerve at the root exit zone. In three of the four cases, the hemifacial spasm disappeared after removal of the tumor in contact with the facial nerve. Compression or encasement of the facial nerve by the tumor was the pathogenesis of the hemifacial spasm in these three cases. The remaining case with tumor (tentorial meningioma) did not have a mass or vessel that directly compressed the facial nerve at the root exit zone. However, the hemifacial spasm disappeared after the removal of the tumor. In a case with a medullary venous malformation with arterial component, an engorged draining vein compressed the root exit zone of the facial nerve. In the remaining three vascular cases--two cases of arteriovenous malformation and a case of saccular aneurysm--enlarged feeding arteries and an aneurysm directly compressed the root exit zone of the facial nerve. Not only arterial or venous but also mass compression can cause hemifacial spasm in some symptomatic cases.

It is most often performed on younger patients and the safety and efficacy of epilepsy surgery in elderly patients are not frequently described. We report a case of a 75-year-old right-handed man who underwent a left fronto-temporal craniotomy for resection of a suprasellar meningioma in 2002. Immediately following hospital discharge, he began to experience complex partial seizures. He continued to have frequent seizures despite treatment with multiple combinations of antiepileptic medications. He presented with status epilepticus every two or three months, and required long periods of hospitalization on each occasion for post-ictal confusion and aphasia. Scalp EEG showed continuous spikes and polyspikes and persistent slowing in the left temporal area, as well as spikes in the left frontal area. EEG telemetry recorded multiple seizures, all with a clear focus in the left temporal area. MRI scan showed an area of encephalomalacia in the left temporal lobe, as well as post-surgical changes in the left frontal area. Neuropsychological testing showed bilateral memory impairment with no significant cognitive decline expected after unilateral temporal lobe resection. A left anteromesial temporal lobectomy was performed with intraoperative electrocorticography. Since surgery, the patient was not seizure-free (Engel class II-b), but had no further episodes of status epilepticus in one year and two months of follow-up. This is one of the oldest patients reported in the literature with epilepsy surgery and supports the possibility of epilepsy surgery in elderly patients for particular cases.

Here we reported a successful evacuation of severe hypertensive brainstem hemorrhage through endoscopic endonasal transclival approach. A 37 years-old male with a 5-year history of uncontrolled hypertension was brought to the Emergency Department with sudden vomiting, limb convulsions, and loss of consciousness for 2 hours. Computed tomography demonstrated a hemorrhage measuring 2.5 × 2.2 cm in the ventral midbrain and pontine. He presented with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 3 and disrupted vitals, and was intubated in the Emergency Department. Considering the ventral location of the hemorrhage and the need for emergent surgical decompression, an endoscopic endonasal approach was applied.

He was weaned off the ventilator and extubated on postoperative day 1, along with an improved GCS score of 5 (E2V1M2). At 1 month postoperatively his GCS score improved to 11 (E4V2M5) and he is currently under rehabilitation.

In contrast, transient postictal imaging abnormalities in patients with tumor-related seizures have been poorly described. Fifty percent of patients with brain tumors have a seizure during the course of their illness and are often imaged after a seizure or after a change in seizure character or frequency. Interval changes on repeat imaging can mimic disease progression or other pathologic processes. We describe 3 patients with brain tumors and transient postictal MRI changes that mimicked disease progression and infection. Our patients demonstrated fluid-attenuated inversion recovery/T2 hyperintensity and gadolinium enhancement on MRI studies performed shortly after ictal events. These changes were suspicious for tumor progression in 2 cases and for recurrent infection in the third. Control of seizure activity resulted in resolution of these changes on scans obtained 10 to 21 days later. Imaging shortly after an ictal event can potentially mislead the clinician to interpret changes as tumor or pathologic progression. Unnecessary intervention in these patients with new and suspicious imaging findings should be avoided. We recommend repeat imaging be performed in patients with brain tumors and seizures several weeks after seizure control if clinically feasible.

The cat completely recovered after treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) and administration of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q24h for 4 days and tapered). However, cluster seizures reoccurred and developed into status epilepticus despite increasing doses of AED. Although the convulsions were resolved by other AEDs, stupor and renal failure developed, and the cat was euthanized. Pathological findings were consistent with hippocampal necrosis. Immunological analysis for leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoantibodies was negative, but antibodies against DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) known as netrin-1 receptor were found. This report describes a case of feline autoimmune limbic encephalitis and hippocampal necrosis that were presumably associated with DCC autoantibodies.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,10.1111/jvim.15492,PMC6524083,MRI; autoantibodies; epilepsy; feline; seizure; status epilepticus,Case Reports,United States,eng

FSE-EPC may be the presenting feature of nonketotic hyperglycemic diabetes mellitus but is more often noted as a late complication especially if there is a coexistent cerebral lesion such as cerebral infarction. FSE-EPC may be related to multiple sclerosis, primary or metastatic brain tumors, the MERRF-MELAS syndrome, benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes, and in some adults with acquired aphasia. The physiological origin of the myoclonic jerks seen in EPC is cortical and may be either spontaneous or provoked by the joint position of the affected limb.

Acute hemorrhage during a radiosurgery session is extremely rare and a plausible cause for this case is discussed along with a literature review of previously reported incidents. The patient was a 71-year-old male presenting with three large intracranial lesions and an underlying primary renal cell carcinoma malignancy. Because of a severe kyphotic deformity resulting from ankylosing spondylitis, the patient was placed in a moderate Trendelenburg position to allow his head to fit into the gamma knife unit during the radiosurgery session. The two left-sided lesions were to be treated with 20 Gy to the 50% isodose line, and the right-sided lesion with 16 Gy to the 40% isodose line. Anesthesia was available throughout the treatment session to aid with pain control. The gamma knife treatment was aborted because the patient suffered a generalized seizure while in the unit. Immediate head CT of the patient revealed large acute hemorrhages into all three intracranial masses. This proved to be a fatal complication. It is likely that this positioning contributed to the hemorrhage. The clinical history of this patient is provided as well as a review of the literature on acute intracranial hemorrhage associated with radiosurgical therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2008.05.012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Case 2, presented with motor neurone disease (MND) at the age of 71 and MRI scanning revealed extensive multinodular non-enhancing white matter lesions in the temporal lobe. There was no history of epilepsy and post mortem histology confirmed MND.Macroscopically multiple small grey well-formed, discrete and coalescent nodules were seen in the deep cortex and subcortical white matter. On histology, mature-looking neurons with large cytoplasmic vacuoles were distributed in a fibrillary background, where vacuoles were also noted. In the resected tumour scattered oligodendroglia-like cells were present. No ganglion cells were seen. The vacuolated cells exhibited immunopositivity for synaptophysin, HuC/HuD and p62 but were negative for NeuN, neurofilament, GFAP, IDH1, nestin and CD34. Electron microscopy showed non-membrane bound cytoplasmic vacuoles in the neurons and in some neuronal processes.

It is commonly complicated by glaucoma and neurological disturbances including seizures, hemiparesis, transient stroke-like deficits, and behavioral problems. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the study of choice for demonstrating the leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and is particularly useful for making the diagnosis. Cerebral hematoma and spontaneous obliteration of cerebral angiomatosis have never been reported in SWS. We describe a patient with type I SWS in which a hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe was caused by an underlying angiomatosis. No arteriovenous malformations were detected by brain CT or gadolinium-enhanced MRI, whereas a small angiomatous nidus draining into an ectasic venous collector near the hematoma was disclosed by brain CT angiography. Carotid angiography, performed 3 years after the hemorrhage, demonstrated the spontaneous obliteration of the angioma. This description expands the phenotypic spectrum of type I SWS in which the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhage and MRI-silent cerebral angiomatosis should be included, and emphasizes the need of performing a brain CT angiography in SWS patients whose routine neuroimaging studies fail to detect potentially harmful vessel malformation.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2007.07.024,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The temporal changes in EEG amplitude and somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitudes in a patient experiencing acute normothermic hypoxemia, a patient experiencing acute circulatory arrest at moderate hypothermia and a collection of patients undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest were analyzed to determine the rate at which changes occur during acute lack of oxygen delivery at various temperatures. In each case, it was found that more rostrally generated potentials disappeared more quickly than more peripheral potentials. All potentials decayed more slowly during acute normothermic hypoxemia than during circulatory arrest. During circulatory arrest at 14.4 degrees C, the amplitude of the Erb's point, N13 and N18 potentials in the SEP took 5 times longer to drop to 50% of their value at the onset of ischemia than with circulatory arrest at 30.9 degrees C. The longer times to disappearance of the SEP potentials during deep hypothermia compared to moderate hypothermia was consistent with the predicted 3.5-6.5 fold reduction in metabolic activity at deep hypothermia compared to moderate hypothermia. The prolonged time to disappearance of the SEP during normothermic hypoxemia demonstrates that even with reduced oxygen delivery the continued delivery of metabolic substrate can be critical to neural function.",{},,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Prolonged electroencephalogram demonstrated one subclinical right frontal seizure, along with right frontal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, presumed to be associated with SE preceding his admission. Initial MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion on diffusion weighted imaging in the right cerebral hemisphere, ipsilateral thalamus, and contralateral cerebellum. A head CT one week later showed diffuse sulcal effacement with loss of gray-white differentiation in the right frontal and insular regions with low attenuation changes of right thalamus. An MRI showed worsened diffusion restriction, despite a corresponding increase in perfusion. The patient remained paretic at discharge and follow-up. Follow-up MRI at 2 months demonstrated pronounced right cerebral and left cerebellar atrophy, loss of gray matter in much of the right cerebrum, and scattered areas of T2 hyperintensity, consistent with permanent right fronto-temporal neuronal loss. Collectively, these observations indicate that imaging findings of persistent cerebral restricted diffusion and cytotoxic edema in the subacute post-ictal period may predict irreversible neuronal injury and poor long-term outcome-even when accompanied by evidence of cortical hyperperfusion and recovery of second- and third-order neurons along the involved circuit.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-015-0155-4,,Deafferentation; Excitotoxic injury; Hyperactivation; Status epilepticus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present a young woman with prediagnosis of relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), treated with interferons, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab. Six months after one and only cycle of alemtuzumab, speech arrest and behavioral changes with aggressive and anxious traits appeared.

Characteristically, patients will develop glucocorticoid-responsive brainstem disorders, demonstrate pontocerebellar contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and exhibit an angiocentric, lymphocytic infiltrate in brain biopsies. We have presented and discussed 2 novel and challenging cases of CLIPPERS syndrome to highlight the clinical and radiological diversity of the syndrome. The first case was of a 66-year-old male patient who had presented with dizziness, headaches, gait disturbances, mild cognitive impairment, and visual field loss to the left side. MRI revealed 1 cerebellar and 2 occipital contrast-enhancing lesions that were suspicious for intracerebral metastases. The second case was of a 53-year-old male patient who had presented with temporal lobe epilepsy, anomic aphasia, and mild cognitive impairment. MRI demonstrated 4 contrast-enhancing lesions in the pons, temporal lobe, and thalamus that were suspicious for intracerebral lymphoma. Because of the radiological presentation, neoplastic disease was the most plausible diagnosis for both patients. However, repeated biopsies ruled out tumor manifestation, and the findings were finally consistent with CLIPPERS syndrome. The significant and long-lasting response to immunosuppressive treatment confirmed the diagnosis. In both cases, the characteristics of CLIPPERS syndrome imitated malignant tumor growth. This scenario can be challenging to clinicians and necessitates inclusion of this neuroinflammatory syndrome in the differential diagnosis of neuro-oncological disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.123,,Biopsy; CLIPPERS; Case series; Pons; Steroids,Case Reports,United States,eng

This finding is generally detected after ischemic stroke, but can also be observed during status epilepticus. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman with a history of focal epilepsy and alcohol abuse presented with an episode of seizure with initial stroke-mimicking changes and no epileptiform activity on electroencephalogram. Upon further examination, the radiological findings revealed a broad cytotoxic edema in the left hemisphere and a smaller lesion in the right cerebellum, showing a rare phenomenon of crossed cerebellar diaschisis. Later, diagnosis of status epilepticus was established. Although the initial trend of the patient's condition was negative, after weeks of therapy and intensive care, the patient slightly improved in her condition and there was a partially reversible lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere and right cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial to detect seizures in patients with stroke-like changes on unenhanced computed tomography examination, and especially in cases in which there are no arterial occlusion on computed tomography angiography and asymmetric arterial vasodilatation are seen. Status epilepticus can mimic stroke, establishing this as a major diagnostic challenge. Although the radiological findings in the left cerebral hemisphere lesion and the right cerebellar hemisphere were similar, its characteristics on diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient value differed, raising an important question of the exact mechanics of how crossed cerebellar diaschisis occurs, as it seems to be a rare phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942715,PMC10806372,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

On the 10th day of his hospital stay, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Brain perfusion SPECT showed asymmetrically hyperperfused and hypoperfused lesions. Brain MRI revealed diffuse T2 hyperintensity with mild diffusion restriction in the pons and hyperperfused lesions on brain SPECT. He was treated based on the diagnosis of hyponatremia and osmotic demyelination. After treatment, the asymmetric hyperperfusion was decreased.

The presence of preoperative tongue spasms encouraged interoperative monitoring of tongue motor responses. The facial nerve exit zone was explored, but microsurgical inspection of the seventh/eighth cranial nerve complex did not reveal any compressive vessel. However, at the anterolateral aspect of the medulla oblongata, the hypoglossal nerve was clearly compressed and distorted laterally by a large tortuous vertebral artery. When the artery was mobilized away from the nerve, the abnormal late electromyographic response to transcranial electrical stimulation disappeared; immediately after shredded Teflon was interpositioned between the artery and the nerve, the abnormal spontaneous tongue fasciculation also disappeared.

The lesion was occipital in 8 instances (infarction 7, porencephalic cyst 1), parietooccipital in 3 (infarction 2, angioma 1) and probably parietal in 2 (epilepsy 1, encephalitis 1). The disorder involved the right hemisphere in 9 cases, the left hemisphere in 3 cases and both hemispheres sequentially in one patient. Hallucinations were accompanied by palinopsia in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case. This particular type of hallucination is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes. Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects. There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story. In most cases, the hallucinations were not clearly related to any visual memory. It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative. The occurrence of such hallucinations with a visual field defect suggests that the cells of the association cortex are more likely to discharge spontaneously once they are deprived of their normal afferent inflow from the calcarine cortex.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/99.4.719,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We present two patients with focal, drug-resistant EPC, who were admitted for intracranial video-electroencephalography monitoring to elucidate the location of the epileptogenic focus and identification of eloquent motor cortex with functional mapping. In both cases, the focus resided at or near eloquent motor cortex and therefore precluded resective surgery. Chronic cortical stimulation delivered through subdural strips at the seizure focus (continuous stimulation at 60-130 Hz, 2-3 mA) resulted in >90% reduction in seizures and abolition of the EPC after a follow-up of 22 months in both patients.

Seizure Onset vs Seizure Network.,"Patel, Kajal H; Mitropanopoulos, Sotiris; Kalamangalam, Giridhar",Patel,"Seizure semiology represents the clinical expression of the activation of the several brain regions comprising an epileptic network. In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), this network includes the insular-opercular-neocortical temporal-hippocampal (IONTH) regions. In this study, we present the case of a patient with pharmacoresistant seizures characterized by nausea, lip-smacking, semipurposeful hand movements, and speechlessness, suggesting dominant hemisphere MTLE, with scalp video-EEG findings and left hippocampal sclerosis on brain MRI confirming the diagnosis. She underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy and was seizure-free for 14 years before relapsing. Recurrent seizure semiology was similar to preoperative seizures, that is, consistent with left MTLE, despite the medial temporal lobe missing. Seizures were therefore assumed to arise from remnant portions of the IONTH network-the insula, operculum, and posterolateral temporal neocortex. Reinvestigation including MEG localization of spikes and acute MRI changes following a seizure cluster suggested a left opercular region epilepsy. Our patient thus demonstrated the principle that seizures with mesial temporal characteristics may arise from outside the mesial temporal lobe (MTL). MTLE semiology arises from the activation of a set of structures (the seizure network) associated with the MTL, which can be triggered by foci both within and outside the MTL itself, and indeed even in its absence. However, it is not necessary to resect the entire extended network to bring about extended periods of seizure freedom in patients with refractory MTLE.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000208012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The present case report may provide additional evidence from post-ictal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supporting this hypothesis. A healthy 13 year-old boy was admitted for a complex partial status epilepticus. MRI, performed one week later, revealed bilateral T2 hyperintense signals in the striata and a left temporal arachnoid cyst. Left temporal slow waves were noted on EEG recording. No obvious metabolic alterations were identified. During the next six years of follow-up, no seizure occurred and striatal alterations progressively disappeared. The clinical characteristics of the seizures, EEG slow waves, and probably the presence of an arachnoid cyst suggest that seizures originated from the left temporal lobe. The long-lasting MRI changes suggest that bilateral striatal alterations may have been secondary to an inflammatory process, which in turn could have disrupted a striatal inhibitory control over seizures. On the basis of these arguments, we speculate involvement of basal ganglia in epileptic seizures, as a part of a modulatory control system over seizures rather than a propagation pathway.

Our objective is to study functional areas involved in writing network, based on the observations of different postoperative writing disorders in a population of patients without preoperative agraphia. We analyzed the postoperative agraphia profiles in 15 patients who underwent surgery for cerebral LGGs in functional language areas, using electrical mapping under local anesthesia. These profiles were then correlated to the sites of the lesions, shown by preoperative cerebral imaging. Our findings showed that (1) spoken language and writing functions could be dissociated, and that (2) writing is subserved, at least partially, by a network of 5 areas located in the dominant hemisphere for language: the superior parietal region, the supramarginalis gyrus, the second and third frontal convolutions, the supplementary motor area, and the insula. Each of these areas seems to have a different role in writing, which will be detailed in this article. However, among the patients, only those with lesions of the supplementary motor area did not recover from agraphia in the postoperative period (in 50% of cases).

We present a patient manifesting HFS induced by a small epidermoid cyst who underwent Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for ipsilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) more than 10 years ago. A 59-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with HFS. Ten years before admission, the patient underwent GKS for ipsilateral VS. Enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the volume of VS was not increased. Also, no definitive mechanical compression of the facial nerve REZ by blood vessels was detected. We concluded that HFS was secondary to the VS treatment by GKS and decided to operate to remove the tumor and identify REZ. A standardized lateral suboccipital retrosigmoid approach was performed. The cochlear nerve was encased by a tumor mass, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was displaced by the mass. During tumor excision, we ensured that the VS and displaced PICA did not directly compress the REZ. Interestingly, an unexpected lesion was found with a yellowish viscous mass located between the sixth nerve and ventral side of the seventh nerve REZ. After the tumor removal, a small piece of Teflon was inserted between the PICA and REZ of the facial nerve. Postoperatively, the patient experienced no HFS or facial nerve dysfunction. Histopathologic examination of the lesion revealed an epidermoid cyst. We should consider various possibilities for the cause of HFS and review brain imaging meticulously if patients were treated for CPA tumor with GKS a long time ago and the delayed HFS occurred without changes in tumor volume. HFS induced by epidermoid cyst is rare. Therefore it is critical for the neurosurgeon to ensure the absence of any abnormal contact with the REZ of the facial nerve during surgery for HFS induced by CPA tumors.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.119,,Epidermoid cyst; Hemifacial spasm; Secondary hemifacial spasm; Vestibular schwannoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 35-year-old man suffered severe chronic right HFS associated with a dilated right lateral mesencephalic vein lying in the vicinity of the facial nerve. This nonessential vein was recruited as a secondary collateral drainage from an inoperable left temporo-occipital arteriovenous malformation. The lateral mesencephalic vein was reached through the superior petrosal sinus using a transfemoral venous approach and was occluded with interlocking detachable coils (Target Therapeutics, Freemont, CA). There was complete remission of HFS without recurrence after 2.5 years of follow-up. This case report supports vascular compression in the pathogenesis of HFS and suggests that facial nerve injury is not essential for the therapeutic effect of surgical decompression.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1097/00006123-199903000-00130,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe a patient with tonic extension of the left limbs caused by a right-sided brainstem lesion as the first manifestation of demyelinating disease. A 19-year-old man was referred with a 4-month history of spontaneous attacks of mild paresthesias of the left arm and leg, followed by 15-45 s of rigid extension of the left limbs, occurring up to 25 times per day. Two months after onset, an MRI scan revealed areas of T2 abnormality in the lateral right cerebral peduncle and deep frontal white matter. The EEG was normal, including during hyperventilation which induced a typical episode. All attacks were successfully suppressed by carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate monotherapy. Serologic testing for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands were absent but cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G was mildly elevated (4.2 mg/dl). Over the next 30 months, serial MRIs revealed a normal spinal cord and persistence of the midbrain lesion, with resolution of some of the white matter lesions but reappearance of others. At 46 months, the midbrain lesion resolved on MRI, and the spasms no longer occurred spontaneously, nor could they be elicited by hyperventilation. While two previous reports have shown internal capsule lesions to underlie the tonic spasms in demyelinating disease, this is the first report in which a brainstem lesion has been causative.",{},,Pediatric neurology,10.1016/0887-8994(94)90114-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
32539656,Magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with non-ketotic hyperglycaemia and focal seizures.,"De Martino, Sara Rosa Maria; Toni, Francesco; Spinardi, Luca; Cirillo, Luigi",De Martino,"We present the neuroimaging findings of three cases of non-ketotic hyperglycaemia (NKH) associated with focal seizures and a review of the previous cases and series reported in literature. NKH is a cause of seizures in both long-standing and newly diagnosed diabetic patients. They are usually focal motor seizures, rarely with a secondary generalisation. This condition does not fully respond to anticonvulsant therapy if glycaemic levels are not normalised. Of interest, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of NKH could be different from those observed during other kinds of seizures. Indeed, seizure-related MRI abnormalities mainly involve the cortical grey matter, while NKH-related seizures usually appear as reversible subcortical T2/fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) hypointensity. This latter abnormality shows a good spatial correlation with the area of the ictal focus on electroencephalogram and could be associated with other more common post-ictal MRI changes (cortical grey matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, cortical or leptomeningeal enhancement). Although these abnormalities tend to be transient, a focal volume loss or gliosis can result on follow-up imaging. Our cases confirm T2/FLAIR subcortical hypointensity as a main neuroradiological hallmark of NKH-induced seizures.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The neuroradiology journal,10.1177/1971400920929554,PMC7482045,Magnetic resonance imaging; non-ketotic hyperglycaemia; reversible T2 hypointensity; seizures,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The lesion was a 3-cm arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that had produced a generalized seizure in an otherwise asymptomatic young woman. A first, resting H2(15)O PET scan identified the AVM. A second PET scan, performed during vibrotactile stimulation of the contralateral hand, identified the somatosensory area of the hand region and localized the AVM to that part of the precentral gyrus immediately in front of it. This relationship and localization were confirmed by cortical mapping at the time of craniotomy under local anesthesia. Functional PET scanning may prove to be useful to localize cortical lesions precisely and to help in determining preoperatively the best form of treatment for lesions, especially AVM's, in functionally important cortex.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.1990.73.4.0615,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

30563494,A case report of delayed cortical infarction adjacent to sulcal clots after traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in the absence of proximal vasospasm.,"Schinke, Christian; Horst, Viktor; Schlemm, Ludwig; Wawra, Matthias; Scheel, Michael; Hartings, Jed A; Dreier, Jens P",Schinke,"Cortical ischemic lesions represent the predominant pathomorphological pattern of focal lesions after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Autopsy studies suggest that they occur adjacent to subarachnoid blood and are related to spasm of small cortical rather than proximal arteries. Recent clinical monitoring studies showed that cortical spreading depolarizations, which induce cortical arterial spasms, are involved in lesion development. If subarachnoid blood induces adjacent cortical lesions, it would be expected that (i) they also develop after traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), and (ii) lesions after tSAH can occur in absence of angiographic vasospasm, as was found for aSAH. An 86-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with fluctuating consciousness after hitting her head during a fall. The initial computed tomography (CT) was significant for tSAH in cortical sulci. On day 8, the patient experienced a secondary neurological deterioration with reduced consciousness and global aphasia. Whereas the CT scan on day 9 was still unremarkable, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 10 revealed new cortical laminar infarcts adjacent to sulcal blood clots. Proximal vasospasm was ruled out using MR and CT angiography and Doppler sonography. CT on day 14 confirmed the delayed infarcts. We describe a case of delayed cortical infarcts around sulcal blood clots after tSAH in the absence of proximal vasospasm, similar to results found previously for aSAH. As for aSAH, this case suggests that assessment of angiographic vasospasm is not sufficient to screen for risk of delayed infarcts after tSAH. Electrocorticography is suggested as a complementary method to monitor the hypothesized mechanism of spreading depolarizations.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-018-1217-y,PMC6297952,Cortical spreading depolarization; Delayed ischemic neurological deficits; Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There is a close temporal relationship between peri-ictal psychosis and seizures, and psychosis may present before (preictal), during (ictal) or after seizures (postictal). Epileptic psychoses usually have acute initial and final phases, with a short symptom duration and complete remission with a risk of recurrence. There is no temporal relationship between interictal or chronic psychosis and epileptic seizures. Another type of epileptic psychosis is related to the response to epilepsy treatment: epileptic psychosis caused by the phenomenon of forced normalisation (alternative psychosis), which includes epileptic psychosis secondary to epilepsy surgery. Although combination treatment with antiepileptic and neuroleptic drugs is now widely used to manage this condition, there are no standard treatment guidelines for epileptic psychosis. We present 5 cases of peri-ictal epileptic psychosis in which we observed an excellent response to treatment with levetiracetam. Good control was achieved over both seizures and psychotic episodes. Levetiracetam was used in association with neuroleptic drugs with no adverse effects, and our patients did not require high doses of the latter. Categorising psychotic states associated with epilepsy according to their temporal relationship with seizures is clinically and prognostically useful because it provides important information regarding disease treatment and progression. The treatment of peri-ictal or acute mental disorders is based on epileptic seizure control, while the treatment of interictal or chronic disorders has more in common with managing disorders which are purely psychiatric in origin. In addition to improving the patient's quality of life and reducing disability, achieving strict control over seizures may also prevent the development of interictal psychosis. For this reason, we believe that establishing a treatment protocol for such cases is necessary.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",10.1016/j.nrl.2012.03.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng; spa
