26227632,Mucor Thrombus.,"Scharf, E L; Cloft, H J; Wijdicks, E",Scharf,To describe a rare presentation of ischemic stroke secondary to angioinvasive mucormycosis and endovascular retrieval of mycotic thrombus with stenting of the compressed vessel. We report a case of angioinvasive mucormycosis that externally compressed and invaded the internal carotid artery causing ischemic cerebral infarction. A sample of the thrombus was obtained using a stent retriever. Subsequent pathological analysis was shown to be consistent with the diagnosis of angioinvasive mucormycosis. The thrombosed and compressed segment was recanalized with the deployment of a stent. The endovascular placement of an expandable stent in the setting of angioinvasive mucormycosis restored good cerebral blood flow in a proximal internal carotid artery occlusion. The patient's aphasia resolved following this intervention. Artifacts of CT angiography may result in the overestimation of acute arterial occlusions. Endovascular carotid stenting may be a palliative measure in the setting of angioinvasive rhino-cerebro-orbital mucormycosis.,{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-015-0186-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Postmortem examination showed an infarct in the posterior temporoparietal region of the right hemisphere. This case demonstrates two new features of crossed dextral aphasia. First, language skills may be fully lateralized to the right hemisphere in right-handed patients. Second, when crossed lateralization occurs, the usual localization of aphasic syndromes is common, suggesting that the intrahemispheric organization mediating language activities is the same in the right hemisphere of the crossed dextral and the left hemisphere of the typical right-handed individual.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.34.4.475,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Language, high level language skills and speech are frequently addressed in presentations and in the literature but pragmatics which includes prosody, attitude, emotions and gestural behaviors is rarely addressed. Pragmatic competence mediated by the right hemisphere, is an equally important and essential component of human communication. An understanding of pragmatics permits the neuroscience nurse to identify and evaluate pragmatic deficits so interventions to facilitate communication can be undertaken. Specifically prosody, that is melody, pause, intonation, stresses and accents, affective tone, subtle grades of meaning and varied emphasis; its components; and aprosodia (lack of prosody) will be discussed. Kinesics, that is limb, body and facial movements, and referred to as pantomime and gestures, will be examined also as will facial expression.

The aim was to test the feasibility and utility of telerehabilitation to support future randomized controlled trials. Post-stroke aphasia is a common and disabling speech disorder, which significantly affects patients' and caregivers' health and quality of life. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, most of the conventional speech therapy approaches had to stop or ""switch"" into telerehabilitation procedures to ensure the safety of patients and operators but, concomitantly, the best rehabilitation level possible. Here, we planned a 5-month telespeech therapy programme, twice per week, of a patient with non-fluent aphasia following an intracerebral haemorrhage. Overall, treatment adherence based on the operator's assessments was high, and incomplete adherence for technical problems occurred very rarely. In line with the patient's feedback, acceptability was also positive, since he was constantly motivated during the sessions and the exercises performed autonomously, as confirmed by the speech therapist and caregiver, respectively. Moreover, despite the sequelae from the cerebrovascular event, evident in some writing tests due to the motor deficits in his right arm and the disadvantages typical of all telepractices, more relevant results were achieved during the telerehabilitation period compared to those of the ""face-to-face"" therapy before the COVID-19 outbreak. The telespeech therapy performed can be considered successful and the patient was able to return to work. Concluding, we support it as a feasible approach offering patients and their families the opportunity to continue the speech and language rehabilitation pathway, even at the time of pandemic.",{},,Journal of integrative neuroscience,10.31083/j.jin2101008,,Aphasia; COVID-19 pandemic; Speech therapy; Stroke; Telerehabilitation,Case Reports,Singapore,eng
34074867,Aphasia Induced by Infratentorial Ischemic Stroke: Two Case Reports.,"Inatomi, Yuichiro; Nakajima, Makoto; Yonehara, Toshiro",Inatomi,"Aphasia induced by an infratentorial stroke has rarely been reported, and its mechanism has not been fully identified. We evaluated two individuals who had been admitted to Saiseikai Kumamoto Hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, due to acute ischemic stroke in order to determine whether their aphasia was induced by an infratentorial stroke. The first patient, a 59-year-old man with a history of left parietal embolic stroke with very mild sequelae of anomia, developed Wernicke's aphasia, nonfluent speech, and right limb ataxia as a result of the stroke. The second patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of chronic renal failure, experienced transcortical sensory aphasia and right one-and-a-half syndrome as a result of the stroke. Both patients' recent ischemic lesions were limited to the right cerebellar hemisphere and the right medial portion of the midbrain. However, SPECT showed low-uptake lesions in both patients' left cerebral hemisphere that did not include the recent ischemic lesions but that had spread to an extent that was difficult to be explained by the old or recent ischemic lesions and that might be responsible for their recent aphasia. We believe that the aphasia experienced by these two patients may have been caused by crossed cerebello-cerebral diaschisis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000266,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31852049,Confusion vs Broca Aphasia: A Case Report.,"Wang, Regina; Wiley, Christi",Wang,"Broca aphasia presents with impaired expression of spoken and/or written language and is often caused by infarction in the Broca area in the frontal lobe. We present a case of Broca aphasia that was initially interpreted as confusion. A 76-year-old woman was brought to the Emergency Department because of confusion and slurred speech that began in the morning. The patient had an extensive history of alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension and had recently quit drinking 5 days earlier. The patient appeared confused, answering questions with ""I don't know,"" but had no signs of agitation. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed a recent infarct involving the left frontal and occipital lobes, coinciding with the Broca area. The patient was able to communicate via writing and eventually made an uneventful recovery of speech. This case demonstrates a patient without the display of stereotypical signs of stroke, yet that was the underlying condition leading to her aphasia. It is important for clinicians to be aware that a stroke can present with isolated findings such as language deficit or confusion.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The Permanente journal,10.7812/TPP/19-061,PMC6907899,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,United States,eng

The second part reports results from a pilot study with three chronic stroke patients who had non-fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real rTMS consisted of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5âdays/week) where individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy.

Relative to entry/baseline testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing times, from two weeks post-intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or placebo rTMS plus speech therapy.

38387377,Situating word deafness within aphasia recovery: A case report.,"Casilio, Marianne; Kasdan, Anna V; Schneck, Sarah M; Entrup, Jillian L; Levy, Deborah F; Crouch, Kelly; Wilson, Stephen M",Casilio,"Word deafness is a rare neurological disorder often observed following bilateral damage to superior temporal cortex and canonically defined as an auditory modality-specific deficit in word comprehension. The extent to which word deafness is dissociable from aphasia remains unclear given its heterogeneous presentation, and some have consequently posited that word deafness instead represents a stage in recovery from aphasia, where auditory and linguistic processing are affected to varying degrees and improve at differing rates. Here, we report a case of an individual (Mr. C) with bilateral temporal lobe lesions whose presentation evolved from a severe aphasia to an atypical form of word deafness, where auditory linguistic processing was impaired at the sentence level and beyond. We first reconstructed in detail Mr. C's stroke recovery through medical record review and supplemental interviewing. Then, using behavioral testing and multimodal neuroimaging, we documented a predominant auditory linguistic deficit in sentence and narrative comprehension-with markedly reduced behavioral performance and absent brain activation in the language network in the spoken modality exclusively. In contrast, Mr. C displayed near-unimpaired behavioral performance and robust brain activations in the language network for the linguistic processing of words, irrespective of modality. We argue that these findings not only support the view of word deafness as a stage in aphasia recovery but also further instantiate the important role of left superior temporal cortex in auditory linguistic processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.12.012,PMC11073474,Aphasia; Functional MRI; Language; Recovery; Word deafness,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Italy,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic mass consistent with epidermoid cyst within the left sylvian fissure. High-definition fiber tractography showed that the arcuate fasciculus was stretched by the tumor. A left frontotemporal craniotomy allowed for near-total excision of the cyst and led to rapid and complete resolution of symptoms.

The authors discuss the problem and analyze the available literature in an attempt to formulate a pathogenetic hypothesis of the different involvement of the known idioms sometimes observed in aphasic polyglots. In particular, when time has elapsed between the learning of the mother tongue and other languages, and all the known languages are, consequently, functionally independent, it is possible that the two or more known idioms have distinct anatomical representations, probably localized separately in the two hemispheres. This could explain why, in some polyglots, aphasia affects one of the known languages preferentially. In subjects in whom the different known idioms were learned during early childhood, the anatomical representation of the languages is similar, which explains why, in this kind of polyglot, all the known languages can be equally affected by cerebral damage that causes aphasia.",{},,Neurosurgery,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Stuck-in-set perseveration, the inappropriate maintenance of a current category or framework, involves an underlying process deficit in executive functioning and is related neuroanatomically to frontal lobe damage. Recurrent perseveration, the unintentional repetition of a previous response to a subsequent stimulus, involves an abnormal post-facilitation of memory traces and is related neuroanatomically to posterior left hemisphere damage. Continuous perseveration is the inappropriate prolongation or repetition of a behavior without interruption.

The result ABC showed that the language functions in the patient, including spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition and naming, were improved after the speech therapy. In addition, results of follow-up DTT suggested that the fiber pathway between the splenium of corpus callosum and the left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) had been established. At the same time, fiber connections between the genu of corpus callosum and the right inferior frontal gyrus (the mirror region of Broca's area) were increased.

This tract in the dominant hemisphere has been shown to play a role in speech initiation and production, and direct subcortical stimulation can induce stuttering and speech arrest in a patient. However, controversy remains as to whether disruption of this pathway will lead to a permanent language deficit and if it is even necessary to map this tract during tumor resections of the dominant frontal lobe. Here, we report a case of a patient with a lower-grade diffuse glioma invading the dominant FAT that was removed with an asleep craniotomy. In the immediate postoperative state, the patient had a transcortical motor dysphasia and was unable to initiate speech. These immediate language deficits quickly recovered, and the patient was neurologically intact at the time of discharge a few days after surgery. Given the high likelihood for a complete neurologic recovery including transient aphasia, we propose that awake mapping for the purpose of identifying the dominant FAT is unnecessary during tumor resection and that disruption of this tract is not associated with any long-term language deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.09.128,,Diffusion tensor imaging; Frontal aslant tract; Glioma; Language processing,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, recent studies utilizing fMRI have shown that right hemispheric dominance occurs more frequently than previously proposed and despite a person's handedness. Here we present a case of a right-handed patient with Broca's aphasia caused by a right-sided brain tumor. This is significant not only because the occurrence of aphasia in right-handed-individuals with right hemispheric brain damage (so-called ""crossed aphasia"") is unusual but also because such findings support dissociation between hemispheric linguistic dominance and handedness.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of radiology case reports,10.3941/jrcr.v11i9.3154,PMC5743139,Anaplastic; Aphasia; Astrocytoma; Broca; Functional; MRI; Neoplasm; Tumor; Wernicke; White Matter; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although it is generally asymptomatic, there have been reports of symptomatic cases. Here, we report a case of right hemiplegia and aphasia due to venous infarction caused by thrombosis of the intraventricular varix. A 79-year-old woman presented with right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia accompanied by conjugate eye deviation to the left. She had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and asymptomatic isolated cerebral varix located in the left lateral ventricle. Blood analysis indicated no abnormalities in coagulation or fibrinolysis. Plain head computed tomography showed an intraventricular varix in the form of a high-density mass, indicating acute phase thrombosis, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography depicted a filling defect in the varix. In addition, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed hyperintense lesions in the deep white matter of the frontal-parietal lobe, indicating venous infarction due to occlusion of the varix of the thalamostriate vein. Glycerol and prophylactic levetiracetam were administered, and she was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation 23 days after treatment initiation. This is the first reported case in which a typically asymptomatic condition, intraventricular cerebral varix, caused venous infarction due to thrombosis and occlusion of the varix of the thalamostriate vein. Careful selection of the treatment strategy is required on a case-by-case basis because an intraventricular varix can cause both bleeding and infarction, which are treated differently.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105954,,Intraventricular cerebral varix; Thalamostriate vein; Thrombosis; Venous infarction,Case Reports,United States,eng

B.R.B. shows the typical pattern of semantic errors in repetition with effects of lexicality and imageability on performance in both languages. The question we asked is whether language type (Turkish or English) or language status--that is, first acquired (L1) or second acquired (L2)--has a greater impact on performance. Results showed that repetition in L1 (Turkish) was better than that in L2 (English). We also observed effects of language status on oral reading, writing to dictation, and naming (spoken and written) with greater impairment to repetition than other tasks in both languages. An additional finding was that spoken-word translation in both directions was worse than written-word translation, and word class had an effect on translation from L1 to L2. We argue that interactive activation models of deep dysphasia could explain deep dysphasia in bilingual speakers and interactions between task and language, if the weighted connections that support language processing in L2 are assumed to be weaker, thus causing rapid phonological decay to have more impact on task performance in L2. Implications of the results for models of bilingual language processing are also considered.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290802057311,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the neurogenic condition, the disorder develops after lesions in the language dominant hemisphere, often affecting Broca's area, the insula, the supplementary motor area and the primary motor cortex. Here, we present two new cases of FAS after posterior fossa lesions. The first case is a 44-year-old, right-handed, Dutch-speaking man who suffered motor speech disturbances and a left hemiplegia after a pontine infarction. Quantified SPECT showed a bilateral hypoperfusion in the inferior lateral prefrontal and medial inferior frontal regions as well as a significant left cerebellar hypoperfusion. Further clinical investigations led to an additional diagnosis of brainstem cognitive affective syndrome which closely relates to Schmahmann's syndrome. The second patient was a 72-year-old right-handed polyglot English man who suffered a stroke in the vascular territory of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and developed a foreign accent in his mother tongue (English) and in a later learnt language (Dutch).

Writing was characterized by sensitivity to lexical-semantic variables (i.e., word frequency, imageability, and part of speech), semantic errors in writing to dictation and written naming, total inability to use the nonlexical phonological spelling route, and agrammatism in spontaneous writing. The reliance on a lexical-semantic strategy in spelling, semantic errors, and impaired phonology and syntax were all highly consistent with the general characteristics of right hemisphere language, as revealed by studies of split-brain patients and adults with dominant hemispherectomy. In addition, this pattern of writing closely resembled the syndrome of deep agraphia.

Its most common cause is temporal damage to the primary auditory cortex of both hemispheres, but it has been reported also following unilateral lesions. In unilateral cases, PWD has been attributed to the disconnection of Wernicke's area from both right and left primary auditory cortex. Here we report behavioral and neuroimaging evidence from a new case of left unilateral PWD with both cortical and white matter damage due to a relatively small stroke lesion in the left temporal gyrus. Selective impairment in auditory language processing was accompanied by intact processing of nonspeech sounds and normal speech, reading and writing. Performance on dichotic listening was characterized by a reversal of the right-ear advantage typically observed in healthy subjects. Cortical thickness and gyral volume were severely reduced in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), although abnormalities were not uniformly distributed and residual intact cortical areas were detected, for example in the medial portion of the Heschl's gyrus. Diffusion tractography documented partial damage to the acoustic radiations (AR), callosal temporal connections and intralobar tracts dedicated to single words comprehension. Behavioral and neuroimaging results in this case are difficult to integrate in a pure cortical or disconnection framework, as damage to primary auditory cortex in the left STG was only partial and Wernicke's area was not completely isolated from left or right-hemisphere input. On the basis of our findings we suggest that in this case of PWD, concurrent partial topological (cortical) and disconnection mechanisms have contributed to a selective impairment of speech sounds. The discrepancy between speech and non-speech sounds suggests selective damage to a language-specific left lateralized network involved in phoneme processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2017.10.006,,Cortical auditory disorders; Diffusion tractography; Disconnection syndrome; Left temporal damage; Pure word deafness,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

However, language has the capacity to influence the selection of purposeful actions. The abilities to use language and to program purposeful movements are often mediated by networks that have anatomic proximity. With hemispheric injury, the diagnosis of apraxia is often confounded by the specific influence of language impairments on the ability to select and produce transitive gestures. We report a patient who illustrates this confound. This patient is a right-handed man who developed global aphasia and neglect after a right hemispheric stroke. His right hand remained deft, and when asked to produce specific transitive gestures (pantomimes), he often performed normally but did make some body part as object and perseverative errors. However, he did not demonstrate the temporal or spatial errors typical of ideomotor apraxia. He also had a perseverative agraphia. Our patient's left hemisphere praxis system appeared to be intact, and the error types demonstrated during production of transitive gestures cannot be attributed to a degradation of postural and movement (praxis) programs mediated by his left hemisphere. The praxis errors types are most consistent with a deficit in the ability to select the necessary praxis programs.

We showed that the tumor infiltration and its resection did not lead to the severe impairments predicted by the localization models assigning a significant role in language processing to the left frontal lobe, notably Broca's area. We showed that slow tumor evolution - the patient had been symptom-free for a long time - enabled compensatory mechanisms to process most language functions endangered by the tumor infiltration.

Injury to the frontal lobe can result in disinhibition and aggression which can result in police intervention and/or incarceration. We highlight four adult cases with a history of severe TBI with frontal lobe injuries and the presence of post-TBI criminal behaviors. There is evidence to support an anatomical basis for aggressive behaviors, yet there are other risk factors to be considered. Behaviors must be investigated thoroughly by obtaining adequate pre- and post-TBI psychiatric and psychosocial histories. By having a comprehensive understanding of aggression while appreciating the complex relationship between TBI, aggression, and premorbid risk factors, clinicians can more adequately treat patients with TBI, with the aim of potentially preventing criminal behaviors and recidivism.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of forensic sciences,10.1111/1556-4029.13289,,aggression; forensic science; frontal lobe; incarceration; recidivism; risk factors; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng
37638456,Diffusion tensor imaging magnetic resonance imaging (DTI-MRI) helps to tailor speech therapy: A case report with a short narrative review.,"Di Lorenzo, Luigi; Muccio, Franco Carmine",Di Lorenzo,"Stroke has functional sequelae, including motor weakness, spasticity, dysphagia, and neurogenic bladder deteriorating activities of daily living. Speech therapy is more often an essential part of the rehabilitation program. Studies in aphasia have primarily focused on two major pathways: the arcuate fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a major fiber bundle connecting Broca's area (associated with language production) and Wernicke's area (associated with language comprehension). Damage to this pathway can result in different types of aphasia, depending on the location and extent of the injury. Tractography is a neuroimaging technique used to map the white matter tracts in the brain. Our patient had an occlusion of the external carotid and left carotid siphon. The patient exhibited early complex language deficits involving both motor expressive and comprehensive abilities. After three months the patient presented conduction aphasia caused by damage to the inferior parietal lobule, which extends into the subcortical white matter and damages the arcuate fascicle. This patient was re-assessed for spasticity and language treatments needs, few months after the stroke. Considering first two months language improvement followed by any further language expressive improvement from 3rd to 6th month, a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography was requested to study interconnections between cortical and subcortical matter. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in our hospital showed an extensive malacic gliotic area in the left temporal-frontal parietal site. Brain MRI is confirmed as a multimodal tool evaluating the damage, both from the point of structural and functional view. Tractography in aphasia allows focusing on major pathways. The involvement of the arcuate fascicle, whose lesion disconnects Broca's and Wernicke's areas, is related to clinical improvement, and represents a neural correlate of the brain injury recovery process that physicians and speech therapists might be aware of it, tailoring the plane of care of each patient.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-230082,,Arcuate fascicle lesion; MRI DTI spectrography; speech therapy; tractography,Case Reports; Review; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Neurocognitive and language processing is one area where involvement of the cerebellum is no longer in question, but the extent and mechanism of this relationship have yet to be defined. For example, which of the cerebellar hemispheres is involved continues to be debated. We present a case wherein a thrombus in the basilar artery led to bihemispheric cerebellar strokes with profound mixed effects on the patient's language and cognition. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral cerebellar strokes resulting in a mixed aphasia reported in scientific literature.

However, when interpreting the results of studies of stroke patients versus healthy controls, there is an inherent difficulty in disentangling the contribution of neuropathology from other sources of between-subject variability. In the present work, we had an unusual opportunity to study an aphasic patient with severe anomia who had incidentally performed a picture naming task in an ERP study as a control subject one year before suffering a left hemisphere stroke. The fortuitous recording of this patient's brain activity before his stroke allows direct comparison of his pre- and poststroke brain activity in the same language production task. The subject did not differ from other healthy subjects before his stroke, but presented major electrophysiological differences after stroke, both in comparison to himself before stroke and to the control group. ERP changes consistently appeared after stroke in a specific time window starting about 250 msec after picture onset, characterized by a single divergent but stable topographic configuration of the scalp electric field associated with a cortical generator abnormally limited to left temporal posterior perilesional areas. The patient's pattern of anomia revealed a severe lexical-phonological impairment and his ERP responses diverged from those of healthy controls in the time window that has previously been associated with lexical-phonological processes during picture naming. Given that his prestroke ERPs were indistinguishable from those of healthy controls, it seems highly likely that the change in his poststroke ERPs is due to changes in language production processes as a consequence of stroke. The patient's neurolinguistic deficits, combined with the ERPs results, provide unique evidence for the role of left temporal cortex in lexical-phonological processing from about 250 to 450 msec during word production.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21412,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

This paper reports the clinical and fMRI findings in a strongly right-handed (late) multilingual patient who developed differential polyglot aphasia, ataxic dysarthria and a selective decrease in executive function due to an ischemic stroke in the left cerebellum. fMRI revealed that lexical-semantic retrieval in the unaffected L1 was predominantly associated with activations in the left cortical areas (left prefrontal area and left postcentral gyrus), while naming in two affected non-native languages recruited a significantly larger bilateral functional network, including the cerebellum. It is hypothesized that the left cerebellar insult resulted in decreased right prefrontal hemisphere functioning due to a loss of cerebellar impulses through the cerebello-cerebral pathways.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Brain and language,10.1016/j.bandl.2017.09.001,,Bilingualism; Cerebellum; Differential recovery; Polyglot aphasia; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

We describe a case of CA after right hemispheric stroke in a right-handed patient with atypical language dominance and attempt to analyze the mechanism of CA based on functional imaging methods, including arterial spin labeling (ASL) and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI). Brain MRI at 24Â h after admission showed a large cerebral infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere, including the posteroinferior part of Broca's area in the right frontal lobe, the right temporal lobe, and the right occipital lobe. The patient exhibited a non-fluent aphasia on a standard language test (the Aphasia Battery of Chinese [ABC]) performed on the 7th day after onset. Thus, atypical language dominance was suspected. One week after admission, ASL imaging showed high perfusion in the infarct core zone and low perfusion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Two months later, PET/MRI demonstrated low metabolism in the posterior frontal lobe, temporal lobe, temporal occipital junction area, and the right basal ganglia. The findings suggest that the patient has right-sided cerebral language dominance, or that both hemispheres have linguistic functions.

Both CT and MRI detected lesions; however, MRI provided better differentiation of gray and white matter. Coronal reconstructions aid in optimally visualizing the relationship of lesions to the opercular and perisylvian gyri.

This study describes a right-handed patient with an ischemic lesion in the right thalamus. In the post-acute phase of the stroke, a unique combination of 'crossed thalamic aphasia' was found with left visuo-spatial neglect and constructional apraxia. On the basis of the criteria used in MariÃ«n et al. [67], this case-report is the first reliable representative of vascular CAD following an isolated lesion in the right thalamus. Furthermore, this paper presents a detailed analysis of linguistic and cognitive impairments of 'possible' and 'reliable' subcortical CAD-cases published since 1975. Out of 25 patients with a pure subcortical lesion, nine cases were considered as 'possibly reliable or reliable'. A review of these cases reveals that: 1) demographic data are consistent with the general findings for the entire group of vascular CAD, 2) the neurolinguistic findings do not support the data in the general CAD-population with regard to a) the high prevalence of transcortical aphasia and b) the tendency towards a copresence of an oral versus written language dissociation and a 'mirror-image' lesion-aphasia profile, 3) subcortical CAD is not a transient phenomenon, 4) the lesion-aphasia correlations are not congruent with the high incidence of anomalous cases in the general CAD-population, 5) neuropsychological impairments may accompany subcortical CAD.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2008/905187,PMC5452438,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng

To illustrate language outcomes in the young-adult brain, we present the case of J., a 23-year-old woman with chronic aphasia from a left-hemisphere stroke affecting the temporal lobe. Diffusion MRI-based tractography indicated that J.'s language-relevant white-matter structures were severely damaged. Employing magnetoencephalography (MEG), we explored J.'s conceptual preparation and word planning abilities using context-driven and bare picture-naming tasks. These revealed naming deficits, manifesting as word-finding difficulties and semantic paraphasias about half of the time. Naming was however facilitated by semantically constraining lead-in sentences. Altogether, this pattern indicates disrupted lexical-semantic and phonological retrieval abilities. MEG revealed that J.'s conceptual and naming-related neural responses were supported by the right hemisphere, compared to the typical left-lateralised brain response of a matched control. Differential recruitment of right-hemisphere structures (330-440âms post-picture onset) was found concurrently during successful naming (right mid-to-posterior temporal lobe) and word-finding attempts (right inferior frontal gyrus). Disconnection of the temporal lobes via corpus callosum was not critical for recruitment of the right hemisphere in visually guided naming, possibly due to neural activity right lateralising from the outset. Although J.'s right hemisphere responded in a timely manner during word planning, its lexical and phonological retrieval abilities remained modest.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The European journal of neuroscience,10.1111/ejn.15813,PMC9826534,alpha oscillations; beta oscillations; event-related fields; language lateralisation; splenium,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",France,eng

A 54-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained severe traumatic brain injury. Two months later, she developed bilateral proptosis and audible bruit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain demonstrated the right direct CCF. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed a small hyperintense area at the left basal ganglia. Ten days later, she developed right-sided grade 2/5 hemiparesis, facial upper motor neuron weakness, and cognitive impairment. Follow-up MRI showed significant progression of hyperintensities involving the left-sided centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum, basal frontal, temporal lobes, especially subcortical white matter on FLAIR images, and multiple hypointense foci of hemorrhagic component on T2*-weighted gradient-echo images, representing hemorrhagic venous infarction. While waiting for embolization, she rapidly developed right hemiplegia and aphasia, and became somnolent. Under general anesthesia, emergency endovascular treatment was performed successfully to obliterate the fistula without surgical intervention. Five months after endovascular treatment, MRI and MRA confirmed no residual fistula and revealed nearly complete resolution of abnormal increased signal intensity. In the present case, the factors related to the presence of this rare condition were absence of the ipsilateral basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR), occlusion of posterior segment of the contralateral superior petrosal sinus, and a developed uncal vein with hypoplastic second and third segments of the contralateral BVR.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",10.1177/1591019918776615,PMC6116133,Venous infarction; basal vein of Rosenthal; direct carotid-cavernous fistula; traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula; venous congestion,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

While the general consensus that only left-sided thalmic lesions are associated with aphasia is confirmed, analysis of the sites of the thalamic infarctions and the dysphasia elements did not reveal an unequivocal correlation. The explanation of this finding is that (a) disruption of any circuit, whether taking place in the connections or in the nuclei, leads to dysfunction and (b) thalamofrontal connections are not topographically arranged according to the thalamic nuclei, but show a frontal rostrocaudal/thalamic mediolateral interrelationship irrespective of thalamic nuclear masses.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00314212,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

All patients with primary progressive aphasia reported at least a 2-year history of slowly progressive aphasia without other signs of global dementia. The initial Western Aphasia Battery results of the 10 patients with primary progressive aphasia were compared with those of a sample of 10 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and with those of a sample of 10 patients with aphasia due to a left hemispheric stroke. Both reference samples were matched for age and sex; the sample with stroke-caused aphasia was additionally matched for the aphasia type. Expressive language disability with reduced speech fluency and anomia but preserved language comprehension and nonverbal cognition were typical features in early stages of primary progressive aphasia. Spontaneous speech was significantly more impaired in patients with primary progressive aphasia in comparison with those with aphasia after left hemisphere stroke and with language impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Cerebral microbleeds are black, rounded spots on SWAN caused by blood-products deposition following red blood cell leakage from small cerebral vessels brain. Both microbleeds and HARM carry important prognostic implication as they are associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. A 79-year-old man presented with aphasia and right hemiparesis due to ischemic stroke with left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Admission NIHSS score was 7, and he was successfully treated by intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy.

Left middle cerebral artery was permeable. The patient was anticoagulated for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, and a second MRI following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure showed multiple left hemispheric diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintense spots and a left hemispheric sub-arachnoid hyperintensity on FLAIR, compatible with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This diagnosis was excluded by SWAN MRI sequence and a normal cerebral CT the same day. The diagnosis of HARM was retained. At day 9, patient's condition improved, and a control MRI did not show evidence of HARM. However, numerous microbleeds were detected in the left hemisphere only (ipsilateral with HARM and stroke). This case highlights first of all the importance of differentiating HARM and subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially in an anticoagulated patient with clinical aggravation. Secondly, it is crucial to identify microbleeds and understand their pathophysiology, as they are associated with higher risk of hemorrhage and stroke recurrence in ischemic stroke patients. Finally, the mono-hemispheric appearance of microbleeds in this case suggests for the first time that, in some acute ischemic stroke patients, a relationship between HARM and cerebral microbleeds may exist.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-02658-6,PMC9009060,Atrial fibrillation; Blood-brain barrier; Brain-blood-barrier disruption; Case report; Cerebral microbleeds; Cerebrovascular disease/Stroke; FLAIR hyperintense cerebrospinal fluid; Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker; Ischemic stroke; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We present a rare case of a 74-year-old Chinese woman who presented with sudden onset of headache and right arm weakness that mimicked acute ischemic stroke. Her initial computed tomography was unremarkable, and intravenous thrombolysis was performed. Serial neuroimages confirmed ICoVT 4 days after symptom onset, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was started at a dose of 0.4 ml twice per day, according to the 2019 Chinese guidelines. The workup for the predisposing causes of ICoVT revealed triple positivity APS. LMWH dose was adjusted according to the anti-Xa chromogenic assay. However, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and there was a progressive enlargement of the venous infarction despite treatment with anticoagulants. Transtentorial herniation developed on day 12, and decompressive craniectomy was immediately performed. The patient's symptoms did not improve significantly after surgery, and she remained aphasic and hemiplegic at the 3-month follow-up, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 5. ICoVT is a rare yet potentially fatal manifestation of APS, and its diagnosis and treatment are extremely challenging. Timely diagnosis, prompt treatment, and close monitoring are essential to improve the clinical prognosis of patients with APS-related ICoVT.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2022.882032,PMC9082262,anticoagulation; antiphospholipid syndrome; case report; cortical vein thrombosis; decompressive craniectomy; magnetic resonance,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Following an intensive course of treatment with our adapted form of MIT, her performance improved on both trained and untrained phrases, as well as on speech and language tasks. These behavioral improvements were accompanied by functional MRI changes in the right frontal lobe as well as by an increased volume of white matter pathways in the right hemisphere.

Conducting a formal neuropsychological evaluation concerning a patient's neurologic status during the chronic recovery phase can be challenging. Furthermore, the clinical assessment of survivors of penetrating TBI has not been adequately documented in the available literature. Severe TBI in patients can provide valuable information about the functional significance of the damaged brain regions. This information can help inform our understanding of the brain's intricate neural network. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 29-year-old right-handed man who sustained a left-hemisphere TBI after a gunshot, causing extensive diffuse damage to the left cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, mainly sparing the right hemisphere. The patient survived. The patient experienced spastic right-sided hemiplegia, facial hemiparesis, left hemiparesis, and right hemianopsia. Additionally, he had severe global aphasia, which caused difficulty comprehending verbal commands and recognizing printed letters or words within his visual field. However, his spontaneous facial expressions indicating emotions were preserved. The patient received a thorough neuropsychological assessment to evaluate his functional progress following a severe TBI and is deemed to have had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Research on cognitive function recovery following loss of the right cerebral hemisphere typically focuses on pediatric populations undergoing elective surgery to treat severe neurological disorders. In this rare instance of a favorable outcome, we assessed the capacity of the fully developed right hemisphere to sustain cognitive and emotional abilities, such as language.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.941601,PMC11180484,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present the case of a 40-year-old female admitted originally for neck pain of sudden onset, accompanied by nausea and marked right arm paresis. A CT-scan revealed left fronto-central cortico-subcortical haemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was normal. Two months after the initial event the residual paresis worsened and the patient developed neuropsychological deficits. A CT-scan showed oedema around the original bleeding site, on MRI a solid lesion with a diameter of 5 cm could be seen, with some cystic alterations and contact to the meninges. The tumour was surgically removed, and removal at the time was considered complete. Histological analysis proved it to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's neurological deficits gradually improved. Almost three months after the operation she complained of intense left-sided headache. On CT a hyperdense left fronto-central lesion with positive enhancement could be seen; MRI confirmed a relapse tumour and showed bleeding in the rostral portion of the tumour as well as oedema. The patient started radiation therapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Whole body image studies at the time failed to reveal any other neoplastic lesions. Two months later a CT-scan showed continued tumour growth. We present this case as a rare aetiology of intracerebral haemorrhage, more frequently associated with arterial hypertension or vascular pathology, as well as being an unusual manifestation of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, rarely found in the brain.

We investigated changes in the Korean (L1) and Japanese (L2) language recovery patterns. Both Korean and Japanese versions of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) were completed one month after the stroke, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed using picture-naming tasks.

After six months of language therapy targeting L1, the Korean-WAB score improved significantly, while the Japanese-WAB score showed slight improvement. In this case, the subcortical lesion contributed to crossed bilingual aphasia more highly affecting L1 due to loss of the cortico-subcortical control mechanism in the dominant hemisphere. The paradoxical pattern of bilingual aphasia disappeared after lengthy language therapy targeting L1, and the therapy effect did not transfer to L2.

A 51-year-old, right-handed male presented with right hemiparesis, which occurred at the onset of a spontaneous ICH in the left corona radiata and basal ganglia. Brain magnetic resonance images showed a hematoma in the left subcortical area at one month after onset and hemosiderin deposits in the left subcortical area at nine years after onset. At four weeks after onset, he exhibited severe aphasia, and Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) testing revealed an aphasia quotient in the 39.6 percentile (%ile). However, his aphasia improved to nearly a normal state, and at three months after onset, his aphasia quotient was in the 90.5Â %ile. At approximately eight years after onset, he began to show aphasia, and his aphasia increased slowly with time resulting in a WAB aphasia quotient in the 12.5Â %ile at nine years after onset. The integrity of the left AF over the hematoma was preserved on 1-month post-onset DTT. However, the middle portion of the left AF in the middle of the hemosiderin deposits showed discontinuation on 9-year post-onset DTT. The fractional anisotropy value of the left AF was higher on the 9-year post-onset DTT (0.48) than that on the 1-month post-onset DTT (0.35), whereas the mean diffusivity value was lower on the 9-year post-onset DTT (0.10) than that on the 1-month post-onset DTT (0.32). The fiber number of the left AF was decreased to 175 on the 9-year post-onset DTT from 239 on the 1-month post-onset DTT. We report on a patient with ICH who showed delayed development of aphasia, which appeared to be related to degeneration of the AF in the dominant hemisphere.

Single photon emission CT revealed a wider area of low perfusion over the entire left frontal lobe, including the superior, middle and inferior frontal gyrus. The aphasia symptoms, mainly poor comprehension, disappeared quickly several weeks after the event. This may have been due to a reduction in the size of the haematoma and a resolution of the oedema around the haematoma. Clinically, the transcortical sensory aphasia in this case was indistinguishable from that caused by damage to the posterior language areas. Further case reports of transcortical sensory aphasia associated with frontal lobe lesions would help to confirm whether a relatively rapid recovery is characteristic in cases such as this.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/026990599121124,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
16586117,Expanding the treatment window with mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke.,"Layton, Kennith F; White, J Bradley; Cloft, Harry J; Kallmes, David F; Manno, Edward M",Layton,"Acute ischemic stroke is a common disease associated with high mortality and significant long-term disability. Treatment options for acute ischemic stroke continue to evolve and include pharmaceutical and mechanical therapies. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of a new device for mechanical thrombectomy, the options available for treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been expanded. Thrombolytic therapy is generally given intravenously in the first 3 h and up to 6 h via the intraarterial route for pharmacological clot disruption. The maximum time-frame for mechanical thrombectomy devices has yet to be determined. A 78-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a dense right hemiparesis, leftward gaze preference and dense global aphasia. Eight hours after symptom onset, left carotid angiography confirmed a left internal carotid artery terminus occlusion. A single pass was made through the clot with an X6 Merci Retriever device. After a single pass, the vessel was reopened and normal flow in the left internal carotid artery was demonstrated. At the time of discharge, her neurological deficits had improved significantly. Furthermore, the final infarct area, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, was probably much smaller than it would have been if the vessel had not been recanalized. We report the use of a new mechanical thrombectomy device 8 h after onset of ischemic symptoms, with substantial subsequent improvement in neurological outcome. In selected cases, use of the Merci Retriever can result in improved outcomes beyond the traditional 6-h window used for intraarterial pharmacological thrombolysis.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuroradiology,10.1007/s00234-006-0073-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
16209426,"On pure word deafness, temporal processing, and the left hemisphere.","Stefanatos, Gerry A; Gershkoff, Arthur; Madigan, Sean",Stefanatos,"Pure word deafness (PWD) is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by severe difficulties in understanding and reproducing spoken language, with sparing of written language comprehension and speech production. The pathognomonic disturbance of auditory comprehension appears to be associated with a breakdown in processes involved in mapping auditory input to lexical representations of words, but the functional locus of this disturbance and the localization of the responsible lesion have long been disputed. We report here on a woman with PWD resulting from a circumscribed unilateral infarct involving the left superior temporal lobe who demonstrated significant problems processing transitional spectrotemporal cues in both speech and nonspeech sounds. On speech discrimination tasks, she exhibited poor differentiation of stop consonant-vowel syllables distinguished by voicing onset and brief formant frequency transitions. Isolated formant transitions could be reliably discriminated only at very long durations (> 200 ms). By contrast, click fusion threshold, which depends on millisecond-level resolution of brief auditory events, was normal. These results suggest that the problems with speech analysis in this case were not secondary to general constraints on auditory temporal resolution. Rather, they point to a disturbance of left hemisphere auditory mechanisms that preferentially analyze rapid spectrotemporal variations in frequency. The findings have important implications for our conceptualization of PWD and its subtypes.",{},,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The pathophysiology of FAS is not yet understood. A 68-year-old Italian man was admitted to the EmergencyDepartment for non-fluent aphasia and dysarthria. Computed tomography (CT) scan did not show abnormalities; the patient was treated with systemic thrombolysis. A repeated brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an infarct in the left primary motor cortex and mild extension to cortico-subcortical frontal regions. In the following days he gradually improved, speaking Italian fluently with a typical German accent. In conclusion, FAS is a rare motor speech disorder, often related to cerebrovascular accidents involving critical regions in the dominant hemisphere. In addition, the present case adds further evidence to the role of the left primary motor cortex in modulation of prosody.

The patient described has shown signs of apathy and loss of initiative, in combination with cognitive deficits, which have persisted essentially unaltered up to the present day since an abrupt onset 17 years ago. High resolution MRI was performed to show the extent of the lesion; a combination of published and experimental neuropsychological techniques was administered to show the nature of the cognitive defects; Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to obtain a measure of cortical perfusion. Brain MRI disclosed an isolated lacunar infarction in the dorsal caudal intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. Neuropsychological evaluation indicated problems with attention and concentration, executive disturbances, and memory deficits both in the visual and verbal domains. The memory deficits could not be attributed to problems in the early stages of information processing, and are hence regarded as resulting from a failure of retrieval rather than encoding or storage. Brain SPECT disclosed a hypoperfusion of the right frontal cortex. The data indicate that the cognitive profile is the result of a dysfunction of executive functions. This is corroborated by the finding of decreased blood flow in the right frontal cortex, and by evidence from the neuroanatomical literature. Thus the dysexecutive symptoms are thought to be caused by disconnection of the prefrontal cortex from the brainstem activating nuclei through the strategic localisation of the right thalamic infarction.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.66.1.36,PMC1736166,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

27864027,Patterns of neural activity predict picture-naming performance of a patient with chronic aphasia.,"Lee, Yune Sang; Zreik, Jihad T; Hamilton, Roy H",Lee,"Naming objects represents a substantial challenge for patients with chronic aphasia. This could be in part because the reorganized compensatory language networks of persons with aphasia may be less stable than the intact language systems of healthy individuals. Here, we hypothesized that the degree of stability would be instantiated by spatially differential neural patterns rather than either increased or diminished amplitudes of neural activity within a putative compensatory language system. We recruited a chronic aphasic patient (KL; 66 year-old male) who exhibited a semantic deficit (e.g., often said ""milk"" for ""cow"" and ""pillow"" for ""blanket""). Over the course of four behavioral sessions involving a naming task performed in a mock scanner, we identified visual objects that yielded an approximately 50% success rate. We then conducted two fMRI sessions in which the patient performed a naming task for multiple exemplars of those objects. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) searchlight revealed differential activity patterns associated with correct and incorrect trials throughout intact brain regions. The most robust and largest cluster was found in the right occipito-temporal cortex encompassing fusiform cortex, lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and middle occipital cortex, which may account for the patient's propensity for semantic naming errors. None of these areas were found by a conventional univariate analysis. By using an alternative approach, we extend current evidence for compensatory naming processes that operate through spatially differential patterns within the reorganized language system.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.11.010,,Aphasia; Language; MVPA; Picture-naming; Production; Semantic; Speech production; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

20350179,What does the right hemisphere know about phoneme categories?,"Wolmetz, Michael; Poeppel, David; Rapp, Brenda",Wolmetz,"Innate auditory sensitivities and familiarity with the sounds of language give rise to clear influences of phonemic categories on adult perception of speech. With few exceptions, current models endorse highly left-hemisphere-lateralized mechanisms responsible for the influence of phonemic category on speech perception, based primarily on results from functional imaging and brain-lesion studies. Here we directly test the hypothesis that the right hemisphere does not engage in phonemic analysis. By using fMRI to identify cortical sites sensitive to phonemes in both word and pronounceable nonword contexts, we find evidence that right-hemisphere phonemic sensitivity is limited to a lexical context. We extend the interpretation of these fMRI results through the study of an individual with a left-hemisphere lesion who is right-hemisphere reliant for initial acoustic and phonetic analysis of speech. This individual's performance revealed that the right hemisphere alone was insufficient to allow for typical phonemic category effects but did support the processing of gradient phonetic information in lexical contexts. Taken together, these findings confirm previous claims that the right temporal cortex does not play a primary role in phoneme processing, but they also indicate that lexical context may modulate the involvement of a right hemisphere largely tuned for less abstract dimensions of the speech signal.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21495,PMC4471482,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng

Several studies have shown that tPBM can help individuals with stroke or traumatic brain injury achieve significant cognitive improvements. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A 38-year-old female, who sustained an ischemic stroke on the left side of the brain, received two, 5-month series of treatments.

The major cortical language areas were subjacent to the scalp placements along the line of the Sylvian fissure. At each session, first a light-emitting diode (LED) cluster head with red (630 and 660ânm) and near-infrared (850ânm) wavelengths, with an irradiance (power density) of 200âmW/cm<sup>2</sup>, a beam size of 4.9âcm<sup>2</sup>, and a fluence (energy density) of 12âJ/cm<sup>2</sup> per minute, was applied to the left side of the scalp/brain, along the Sylvian fissure for 60âsec at each at the following eight, language network target areas: frontal pole, prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area); supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus in the parietal lobe; inferior motor/sensory cortex (mouth area); and posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and superior temporal sulcus in the temporal lobe, for a total of 8âmin. Second, for the next 20âmin (1200âsec), simultaneous with speech-language therapy, an LED PBM helmet was applied to the scalp/head. This helmet contained 256 separate LED lights, near-infrared (810ânm) wavelength, 60âmW power per LED light, total power, 15 W; energy, 72 Joules; fluence, 28.8âJ/cm<sup>2</sup>; and irradiance, 24âmW/cm<sup>2</sup>. <b><i>Results and conclusions:</i></b> During the initial, 5-month treatment series with traditional speech-language therapy only, there was little to no improvement in dysarthria and expressive language. During the second, 5-month treatment series, however, with tPBM applied first, to the left hemisphere only, and second, to both hemispheres during each session plus simultaneous speech-language therapy, there was marked improvement in the dysarthria and expressive language. After the first 5-month series, this PWA had utilized a slow rate of speech with a production of â¼25 to 30 words-per-minute during conversations and spontaneous speech. Utterance length was only 4-6 words with simple, grammatical structure. After the second, 5-month series of treatment combining tPBM plus speech-language therapy, the rate of speech increased to 80+ words-per-minute and utterance length was increased to 9-10 words, with more complex grammatical structure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",10.1089/photob.2022.0024,PMC10171962,LLLT; PBM; aphasia; low-level laser therapy; photobiomodulation; speech-language therapy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Based on Hughling Jackson's (1884/1958) notion of the duality of the symptom, we proposed a model of the development and process of psychopathology following brain injury, which views the development of the psychopathological behavior as a product of acquired cognitive and perceptual defects and ensuing compensatory strategies. For the present case study of paranoia, this involved defects in long-term memory, conceptual ability, and compensatory strategies of confabulation and self-referential orientation. Neuropsychological testing established defects in concept formation tasks including the Raven Progressive Matrices, the Leiter International Performance Scale, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test, as well as long-term memory defects where cognitive reorganization was needed. The paranoid process was understood as a product of disordered conceptual ability in interpersonal situations, and a self-referential conceptual classification system, which took time, and changed social relations, to emerge.

Perfusion, diffusion, sodium, and conventional anatomic MRI were used to follow physiological and structural changes.

Recovery of the patient confirmed as having a completed stroke affecting Broca's area occurred rapidly with a shift of activation to the homologous region in the right hemisphere within 3 days, with continued rightward lateralization over 6 months. In the second patient, in whom mapping was performed fortuitously before stroke, recovery of a Wernicke's aphasia showed a similar increasing rightward shift in activation recruitment over 9 months after the event. Recovery of aphasia in adults can occur rapidly and is concomitant with an activation pattern that changes from left to a homologous right hemispheric pattern.

The supposed mechanism behind this improvement is a release of preserved left hemisphere (LH) language networks from RH transcallosal inhibition. Direct stimulation of the damaged LH can sometimes bring similar results too. Therefore, we developed a novel treatment approach that combined direct LH (Broca's area (BA)) stimulation, by intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS), with homologue RH area's inhibition, by continuous TBS. We present the results of application of 15 daily sessions of the described treatment approach in a right-handed patient with chronic post-stroke non-fluent aphasia. The intervention appeared to improve several language functions, but most notably propositional speech, semantic fluency, short-term verbal memory, and verbal learning. Bilateral TBS modulation of activation of the language-related areas of both hemispheres seems to be a feasible and promising way to induce recovery in chronic aphasic patients. Due to potentially cumulative physiological effects of bilateral stimulation, the improvements may be even greater than following unilateral interventions.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2014.890731,,aphasia; interhemispheric interaction; language; propositional speech; rehabilitation; semantic fluency; stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation; verbal learning,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A pooled worldwide review of 5258 cases from several clinical protocols for treatment of acute myocardial infarction, using tissue plasminogen activator from one source, revealed a similar overall incidence of 0.68%. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage may be reduced by lowering the total dose of tissue plasminogen activator or by reducing the infusion rate and duration. The incidence of central nervous system hemorrhage with tissue plasminogen activator is within the range reported with streptokinase, but because equal coronary artery thrombolytic doses are not known, no definitive comparison is possible.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1988.00520340024005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Testing revealed recognition of superordinate boundaries of animals, tools, vegetables, fruit, clothes, and furniture. GP was able to distinguish proper names from other nouns and from nonwords. GP was also able to differentiate words representing living things from those denoting nonliving things. The extent of LH infarct resulting in a global impairment to phonological and syntactic processing suggests LH specificity for these functions but considerable right-hemisphere (RH) participation in visual lexicosemantic processing. The relative preservation of visual lexicosemantic abilities despite severe impairment to all aspects of phonological coding demonstrates the importance of the direct route to the meaning of single printed words.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.2000.2360,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The onset is usually sudden, with moderate contralateral weakness. Sensory changes may be present but remain mild. The patients are apathetic, show perseveration and may be disoriented. In left-sided infarcts, transcortical aphasia, verbal and visual memory impairment and sometimes acalculia are found. In right-sided infarcts, hemispatial neglect, visual memory impairment and disturbed visuospatial processing are common. A decreased level of consciousness, disturbed ocular movements, severe motor weakness and delayed abnormal movements do not occur. Involvement of the ventral lateral and dorsomedial nucleus with sparing of the intralaminar nuclei, posterolateral formation and upper midbrain may explain this picture. The fact that the tuberothalamic artery arises from the posterior communicating artery, which often receives its supply from the carotid system, further justifies considering unilateral tuberothalamic infarcts as a syndrome.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.17.3.434,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The present case is a patient who suffered a left fronto-temporal injury, resulting in severe problems with understanding verbal material, and who was taught to use the undamaged right hemisphere to translate the verbal material into visual material. He was then instructed to 're-translate' the processed material that he understood back into verbal material. The use of this treatment method is based on the principle of dual coding, which allows for a more meaningful consolidation of learned material. Additionally, it is crucial that the material used within this treatment approach be meaningful to the patient, in order that his motivation be increased.",{},,Brain injury,10.3109/02699058909004564,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The patient performs rather well with nouns, verbs, and adjectives, poorly with adverbs and function words, and completely fails with nonsense words.

Not only are reports of bilingual subcortical aphasia rare, but E.M.'s deficit is particularly uncommon for it concerns the most used mother tongue (Venetian) much more than a less practiced second language (standard Italian). In this patient, the linguistic deficit in mother tongue production has been observed in spontaneous speech and in cross language translation tasks, where an asymmetrical paradoxical performance has been revealed. Indeed, unlike neurologically intact subjects, E.M. has more difficulties when translating into her mother tongue than into her second language. Although E.M.'s mother tongue is prevalently an oral language, the asymmetrical translation pattern is similar in written and oral translation tasks, thus ruling out the possibility that the deficit simply reflects differences between written and oral language codes. Finally, another remarkable feature of E.M.'s impairment is its stability over almost 5 years from the stroke. We propose that this unusual type of recovery in E.M. is related to the higher degree of automatization of the first language with respect to the second one. This proposal fits with the role of basal ganglia in automatized motor and cognitive performance.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/119.5.1551,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

More detailed examinations of semantic similarity effects within subcategories of mass concepts reveal a variable degree of fine-grain organisation, which may reflect the influence of premorbid personal knowledge and experience. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that common mass or count noun status did not lead to an enhancement of the refractory effects of semantic similarity.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70703-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The main role of the AF is speech repetition; therefore, injury to the AF typically causes conduction aphasia. We report on a patient who showed excellent recovery of aphasia despite complete injury of the AF due to a cerebral infarct. A 54-year-old, right-handed male presented with aphasia and right hemiparesis. Brain MRI showed an infarct in the left centrum semiovale and corona radiata. Diffusion tensor tractography for the AF was reconstructed using DTI-studio software. The Korean-Western Aphasia Battery (K-WAB) was used for measurement of language function. On K-WAB at 1 week after onset, his aphasia type was compatible with global aphasia (aphasia quotient: 12â°, fluency: 5â°, comprehension: 24â°, repetition: 15â°, and naming: 31â°). The patient underwent rehabilitative therapy, including language therapy and medication, which is known to facilitate recovery from aphasia, for a period of 24 months.

Neurological examination revealed disturbed vertical gaze, dysarthria, rigidity of the right upper extremity, and bilateral instinctive grasp reaction. Neuropsychological assessment disclosed Broca's aphasia, buccofacial apraxia, and memory disturbance. MRI of the brain showed atrophy of the frontotemporal lobes, which was more severe on the left than on the right, especially the left inferior frontal gyrus. In most reported cases of CBD, the initial symptom is motor dysfunction of the unilateral upper or lower extremity. However, we should be cautious that among cases with CBD, there have been rare cases that begin with progressive aphasia alone. In our case, the atrophied region of the cerebral cortex was most severe around the left inferior frontal gyrus. In a few reported cases with the initial symptom of aphasia, the atrophied region corresponded considerably to the type of the aphasia. On the other hand, in those whose initial symptom was mainly motor dysfunction of the unilateral extremity, the atrophied region was remarkable in the posterior part of the frontal lobe and parietal lobe. Therefore, we suggest that in CBD the distribution of the cerebral cortical lesions differs in accordance with whether the initial symptom is motor disturbance or aphasia, and that the type of aphasia corresponds to the location of the cortical lesion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

In the acute phase he presented with cerebellar and brainstem symptoms, followed within a few days by a paresis of the right arm and unexpected language disturbances of aphasic origin. The core features of the aphasic syndrome corresponded to a diagnosis of Luria's dynamic aphasia, complicated by expressive and receptive agrammatism. During one year follow-up the ataxia and paretic symptoms disappeared but the slightly ameliorated aphasic syndrome and the sensory disturbances in the left hemicorpus persisted. In the absence of any neuroradiological evidence for a structural lesion in the left frontal language areas, the hypothetical causative role of the right cerebellar lesion on the contralateral prefrontal aphasic symptomatology is advocated and supported by positive 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission-computed tomography findings, revealing a focal hypoperfusion in the clinically suspected areas. In our case, this phenomenon of so-called 'crossed cerebello-cerebral diaschisis', reflecting the distant functional impact of the right cerebellum on the contralateral prefrontal cortical areas, is for the first time associated with an aphasiologic substrate. The co-occurrence of a right cerebellar lesion and an aphasic syndrome forms the first clinical illustration of the pathophysiological hypothesis of a deactivation of prefrontal left hemisphere language functions due to the loss of excitatory impulses through cerebello-ponto-thalamo-cortical pathways.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/s0022-510x(96)00059-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

In the post-acute phase of the stroke, a unique combination of transcortical sensory aphasia with syntactic impairment was found. Because of this atypical semiological association, additional analyses of spontaneous speech were performed. In spite of the typological affinity with the grammatic characteristic of marked simplification of syntax observed in Broca's aphasia, only a wordclass specific, lexical-semantic deficit for verbs was objectified.

4022134,Category-specific naming deficit following cerebral infarction.,"Hart, J; Berndt, R S; Caramazza, A",Hart,"Studies aimed at characterizing the operation of cognitive functions in normal individuals have examined data from patients with focal cerebral insult. These studies assume that brain damage impairs functions of the cognitive processes along lines that honour the 'normal' pre-morbid organization of the cognitive system. For example, detailed study of individual brain-damaged patients has revealed apparently selective disruption of cognitive functions such as auditory/verbal working memory, phonological processing ability, grapheme-to-phoneme translation procedures and semantic processing. Warrington et al. have studied patients with even more fine-grained selective disturbances of the semantic system. The most selective deficits have been reported for four patients who were significantly better at identifying inanimate objects than they were at identifying living things and foods. These patterns of selective deficit after localized brain damage provide important information about the normal organization of the lexicon, and ultimately about how components of the lexical system are related to particular neural substrates. Here, we report a case study of a patient demonstrating a very selective disturbance of the ability to name items from two related semantic categories. Despite normal performance on a large battery of lexical/semantic tasks, the patient shows a consistent and striking disability in naming members of the semantic categories of 'fruits' and 'vegetables'. The selectivity of this deficit supports a category-specific organization of the mental lexicon, and suggests independence of the processing routes involving naming and name recognition.",{},,Nature,10.1038/316439a0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Few studies, however, have investigated the usefulness of this approach for resection of arteriovenous malformations adjacent to eloquent language areas. We demonstrate our experience by using cortical stimulation mapping and report for the first time on the usefulness of subcortical stimulation with interrogation of language function during resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located near language zones. Patients undergoing awake craniotomy for AVMs located in language zones and at least 5 mm away from the closest functional magnetic resonance imaging activation were analyzed. During surgery, cortical bipolar stimulation at 50 Hz, with an intensity of 2 mA, increased to a maximum of 10 mA was performed in the region around the AVM before claiming it negative for language function. In positive language site, the area was restimulated 3 times to confirm the functional deficit. The AVM resection was started based on cortical mapping findings. Further subcortical stimulation performed in concert with speech interrogation by the neuropsychologist continued at key points throughout the resection as feasible. The usefulness of cortical and subcortical stimulation in addition to patient outcomes was analyzed. Between March 2009 and September 2014, 42 brain AVM resections were performed. Four patients with left-sided language zone AVMs underwent awake craniotomy. The AVM locations were fronto-opercular in 2 patients and posterior temporal in 2. The AVM Spetzler-Martin grades were II (2 patients) and III (2 patients). In 1 patient, complete speech arrest was noticed during mapping of the peri-malformation zone, which was not breached during resection. In a second patient who initially demonstrated negative cortical mapping, a speech deficit was noticed during resection and subcortical stimulation. This guided the approach to protect and avoid the sensitive zone. This patient experienced mild postoperative expressive dysphasia that improved to normal within 6 weeks. Complete resection was achieved in all 4 patients. There were no other complications and no permanent neurological morbidity, resulting in good outcome in all 4 patients. Language mapping, both cortical and subcortical during AVM resection, may be valuable in a very select group of AVMs in language zones. Defining safe margins and feedback to the surgeon may provide the highest chances of a surgical cure while minimizing the risk of incurring a language deficit.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.059,,Arteriovenous malformation; Awake craniotomy; Cortical mapping; Language; Subcortical stimulation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Autopsy studies suggest that they occur adjacent to subarachnoid blood and are related to spasm of small cortical rather than proximal arteries. Recent clinical monitoring studies showed that cortical spreading depolarizations, which induce cortical arterial spasms, are involved in lesion development. If subarachnoid blood induces adjacent cortical lesions, it would be expected that (i) they also develop after traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH), and (ii) lesions after tSAH can occur in absence of angiographic vasospasm, as was found for aSAH. An 86-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with fluctuating consciousness after hitting her head during a fall. The initial computed tomography (CT) was significant for tSAH in cortical sulci. On day 8, the patient experienced a secondary neurological deterioration with reduced consciousness and global aphasia. Whereas the CT scan on day 9 was still unremarkable, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 10 revealed new cortical laminar infarcts adjacent to sulcal blood clots. Proximal vasospasm was ruled out using MR and CT angiography and Doppler sonography. CT on day 14 confirmed the delayed infarcts. We describe a case of delayed cortical infarcts around sulcal blood clots after tSAH in the absence of proximal vasospasm, similar to results found previously for aSAH. As for aSAH, this case suggests that assessment of angiographic vasospasm is not sufficient to screen for risk of delayed infarcts after tSAH. Electrocorticography is suggested as a complementary method to monitor the hypothesized mechanism of spreading depolarizations.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-018-1217-y,PMC6297952,Cortical spreading depolarization; Delayed ischemic neurological deficits; Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The opposite phenomenon, a selective sparing of proper names, has also been recently observed.

MRI showed infarct in the left occipital and medial temporal lobe and hypoperfusion of the entire posterior cerebral artery territory, including the splenium. Extensive language testing revealed severely impaired picture naming and oral reading, with relatively spared tactile naming and recognition of orally spelled words, consistent with impaired access to lexical and semantic representations from vision. In addition, he had a milder deficit in accessing lexical representations for output from all input modalities. RMI's execution of various language tasks provided considerable insight into the mechanisms that underlie oral reading. His performance indicated that both semantic access and orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms were partially intact. When information from these two impoverished systems was coupled (the picture of an object presented with its written name), his ability to read/name improved significantly, consistent with the hypothesis that partially accessed semantic information from vision can combine with partially accessed sublexical orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms to access phonological representations for output. Furthermore, his written word and picture recognition improved to normal at a time when magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated reperfusion of the splenium.

Neurological examination upon admission revealed confusional state, global aphasia, conjugate deviation to the left and slight drift of the outstretched right limbs. The right hemiparesis rapidly recovered after admission. CT scan performed on the second hospital day showed discrete low density areas in the left posterior frontal lobe and left temporo-parietal regions. The extent and severity of his global aphasia were unchanged. The second case was an 82-year-old right-handed man with a history of atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to our hospital one hour after he was found unable to speak. Neurological examination upon admission revealed global aphasia, conjugate deviation to the left and suspected right homonymous hemianopia by confrontation. There was no sign of hemiparesis.

Incidental teaching procedures refer to a sequence of interactions between a trainer and a learner which take advantage of teaching opportunities that arise naturally in unstructured situations and appear to be particularly applicable to communication deficits common to persons with traumatic brain injury. This paper presents an overview of incidental teaching procedures and a case study in which incidental teaching procedures were utilized in a multiple-baseline fashion across three sequential environments to increase complete requesting skills. Results show that complete requesting increased to nearly 100% of the trials in each new environment upon procedural implementation, compared to extremely low baseline levels. In addition, significant increases in independently initiated, rather than cued, requests occurred within the first few treatment sessions.

Following left hemisphere damage it has been suggested that the homologue area in the right hemisphere compensates for lost functions. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that inhibitory 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the right IFG can be useful for enhancing recovery in aphasic patients. In the present study we applied activating high frequency (10-Hz) rTMS, which increases cortical excitability, to the damaged lIFG daily for 3 weeks. Pre- and post-TMS EEG are performed, as well as language function assessments with the Aachener Aphasia Test Battery. Results demonstrate a decrease in rIFG activity post rTMS and normalization for the lIFG for beta3 frequency band. Also increased activity was in the right supplementary motor area for beta3 frequency band. In comparison to pre-TMS the aphasic patient improved on repetition tests, for naming and comprehension. After rTMS increased functional connectivity was shown in comparison to before between the lIFG and the rIFG for theta and beta3 frequency band. This case report suggests that 10 Hz rTMS of the lIFG can normalize activity in the lIFG and right IFG possibly mediated via altered functional connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2012.713493,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In this report, we describe eight patients who underwent craniotomy and excision of AVMs at our institutions. Six of these lesions were located in the dominant (left) hemisphere, and two were on the right. All patients underwent preoperative testing with Amytal administered via the carotid artery (Wada test). Subsequently, the patient was placed under local anesthesia, and we performed a craniotomy. Electrocorticography was used to identify epileptogenic brain in the region of the AVM and to establish after-discharge thresholds to electrical stimulation. Stimulation-mapping techniques were then used to delineate critical motor, sensory, and language areas. Trial occlusion of feeding vessels was also carried out to document postocclusion neurological deterioration, if any. At a later time, a second procedure was performed under general anesthesia to excise the lesion and any epileptogenic foci, using the cortical maps derived earlier.

The main potential complications of this treatment are cerebral hyperperfusion (CHP) syndrome and ischemia, and their managements are contradictory to each other. We retrospectively investigated the incidence of the simultaneous manifestation of CHP and infarction after surgery for MMD. Of the 162 consecutive direct revascularization surgeries performed for MMD, we encountered two adult cases (1.2%) manifesting the simultaneous occurrence of symptomatic CHP and remote infarction in the acute stage. A 47-year-old man initially presenting with infarction developed CHP syndrome (aphasia) 2Â days after left STA-MCA anastomosis, as assessed by quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Although lowering blood pressure ameliorated his symptoms, he developed cerebral infarction at a remote area in the acute stage. Another 63-year-old man, who initially had progressing stroke, presented with aphasia due to focal CHP in the left temporal lobe associated with acute infarction at the tip of the left frontal lobe 1Â day after left STA-MCA anastomosis, when SPECT showed a paradoxical decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the left frontal lobe despite a marked increase in CBF at the site of anastomosis. Symptoms were ameliorated in both patients with the normalization of CBF, and there were no further cerebrovascular events during the follow-up period. CHP and cerebral infarction may occur simultaneously not only due to blood pressure lowering against CHP, but also to the 'watershed shift' phenomenon, which needs to be elucidated in future studies.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-017-0845-9,,Cerebral hyperperfusion; Cerebral infarction; Moyamoya disease; Surgical complication,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Dysexecutive syndrome and inattention, for example, alongside a number of other cognitive and behavioural impairments such as memory loss and lack of motivation, significantly affect day-to-day functioning following TBI. This study examined the efficacy of video modelling in emerging speech in an adult male with TBI caused by an assault. In an effort to identify functional relations between this novice intervention and the target behaviour, experimental control was achieved by using within-system research methodology, overcoming difficulties of forming groups for such an highly non-homogeneous population. Across a number of conditions, the participant watched a videotape in which another adult modelled a selection of 19 spoken words. When this modelled behaviour was performed in vivo, then generalization across 76 other words in the absence of a videotape took place. It was revealed that video modelling can promote the performance of previously learned behaviours related to speech, but more significantly it can facilitate the generalization of this verbal behaviour across untrained words. Video modelling could well be added within the rehabilitation programmes for this population.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.809550,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, despite evidence for their effectiveness, the role of the RH is still an open question. We measured changes in resting-state functional connectivity following melody-based intervention, to identify lateralization of treatment-related changes. A patient with aphasia due to left frontal and temporal hemorrhages following traumatic brain injuries (TBI) more than three years earlier received 48 sessions of melody-based intervention. Behavioral measures improved and were maintained at the 8-week posttreatment follow-up. Resting-state fMRI data collected before and after treatment showed an increase in connectivity between motor speech control areas (bilateral supplementary motor areas and insulae) and RH language areas (inferior frontal gyrus pars triangularis and pars opercularis). This change, which was specific for the RH, was greater than changes in a baseline interval measured before treatment. No changes in RH connectivity were found in a matched control TBI patient scanned at the same intervals. These results are compatible with a compensatory role for RH language areas following melody-based intervention. They further suggest that this therapy intervenes at the level of the interface between language areas and speech motor control areas necessary for language production.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neural plasticity,10.1155/2018/6214095,PMC5896238,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Errors were significantly more frequent in the cases of words with stress on the antepenultimate syllable, and of low frequency words. There was a high consistency between errors in naming and reading aloud.

Confusion has arisen with regard to the usage of the related terms pure word deafness, auditory agnosia, and cortical deafness. Three new cases of word deafness are presented including one case with CT and necropsy correlation. These cases are compared with 34 previously reported cases of various cortical auditory disorders. Our review establishes that patients with word deafness who have had formal testing of linguistic and non-linguistic sound comprehension and musical abilities always demonstrated a more pervasive auditory agnosia. Despite the spectrum of auditory deficits and associated language abnormalities, patients with word deafness share common features including aetiology, pathology, clinical presentation and course. These common features justify inclusion of heterogeneous cortical auditory disorders under the rubric of word deafness. Despite some limitations the term ""word deafness"" should be retained for this syndrome, since inability to comprehend spoken words is the most distinctive clinical deficit. Word deafness is most frequently caused by cerebrovascular accidents of presumed cardiac embolisation, with bitemporal cortico-subcortical lesions. The sequence of cerebral injury is not predictive of resulting auditory deficits.

He was followed-up over 10 months at 4-month intervals, with a lateralized lexical decision task (LDT), an attentional task, and a language battery. Testing started when HJ was 2 months poststroke. In the LDT, words were presented to central vision or lateralized to the left or right visual hemifield. At each test period, we examined the effect of the degree of imageability (high vs. low), and the grammatical class (noun vs. verb) of the targets on HJ's response times and error rates, with left visual field, right visual field, and central vision presentations. The results of the experiment showed that the pattern obtained with the LDT could not be accounted for by fluctuations in attention. There was an interaction of grammatical class with degree of imageability with left visual field displays only. The right hemisphere (RH) was faster with high-imageability words than with low-imageability words, regardless of their grammatical class. There was also an overall RH advantage on response times at 2 and 6 months after onset. This RH predominance coincided with a major recovery of language comprehension and the observation of semantic paralexias, while no major change in language expression was observed at that point. Ten months after onset, the pattern of lateralization changed, and response times for the LDT with either presentation site were equivalent. This LH improvement coincided with some recovery of language expression at the single-word level. The results of this study suggest that, in cases of severe aphasia caused by extensive LH lesions, the RH may play an important role in the recovery process. Furthermore, these results show that the contribution of the two cerebral hemispheres to recovery may vary overtime and affect specific aspects of language.",{},,Brain and language,10.1016/s0093-934x(02)00017-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
