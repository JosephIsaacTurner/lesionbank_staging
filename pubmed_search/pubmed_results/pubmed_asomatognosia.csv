7201116,Subcortical neglect.,"Healton, E B; Navarro, C; Bressman, S; Brust, J C",Healton,"Unilateral neglect is usually caused by lesions of the right cerebral cortex, especially parietal. Neglect after subcortical lesions has been reported rarely in thalamic or striatal hemorrhage, and after infarction of thalamus or striatum and internal capsule shown by CT. In these patients, there may have been compression or ischemia of overlying cerebral cortex and white matter. We report a patient with sensory hemineglect, asomatognosia, and anosognosia caused by infarction of striatum and deep white matter, with involvement of neither cortex nor thalamus and without mass effect. This is the first autopsy-confirmed example of human neglect with involvement of only the striatum and deep white matter.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.32.7.776,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
31977238,The behavioral presentation of an individual with a disordered sense of self.,"Johnstone, Brick; Kvandal, Aimee; Winslow, Robin; Kilgore, Jocelyn; Guerra, Melissa",Johnstone,"There is increased recognition that the brain processes a ""sense of self"" (best understood as a sense of ""mineness"") in the right hemisphere association area and which can be distorted due to neurologic injury. Although there are numerous descriptions of types of disorders of the self (e.g., asomatognosia, anosognosia, mirror misidentification disorder, Capgras syndrome, schizophrenia), there are few descriptions of the subjective experiences of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who experience a reduced sense of self. This article presents a longitudinal case study of a woman in her early 40s with a primarily right hemisphere TBI and disorder of the self who had difficulties relating her experiences from the perspective of the self. Subjective interviews, neuropsychological test scores, and objective personality testing illustrate how she reported her experiences of a diminished sense of self, and how this sense of self improved over the normal course of recovery following the TBI. This case demonstrates clinically relevant information regarding how individuals with a reduced ""sense of self"" (i.e., ""mineness"") associated with a right hemisphere TBI may report their subjective experiences and perform on objective testing.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2020.1717622,,Traumatic brain injury; disorder of the self; right hemisphere parietal lobe; sense of self,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
31194981,The dynamic nature of the sense of ownership after brain injury. Clues from asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.,"Romano, Daniele; Maravita, Angelo",Romano,"The sense of ownership is the feeling that a body part belongs to ourselves. Brain damage may disrupt this feeling, leading to somatoparaphrenia (SP), i.e., the delusion that one's limbs belong to someone else. This delusional feeling is typically associated with profound motor and somatosensory deficits. We reviewed the cases of SP reported so far in the literature outlining the clinical and neuroanatomical profile of SP. We then investigated and reported three new peculiar cases of SP that allow new insights into the theoretical framework of this neuropsychological condition. We thus propose an innovative theoretical account that integrates previous evidence and the new cases described. We suggest that a defective update of the ongoing dynamic representation of the body finalised to perception and action, may be the key for the disownership feelings of patients with SP. The erroneous spatial representation of the limb contralateral to the lesion would have the logical consequence of delusional misattribution of the seen own arm.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107119,,Body awareness; Body ownership; Body representation; Body schema; Right brain damage; Somatoparaphrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
34054464,Intentional Supernumerary Motor Phantom Limb after Right Cerebral Stroke: A Case Report.,"Yamada, Mai; Sasahara, Yoshimi; Seto, Makiko; Satoh, Akira; Tsujihata, Mitsuhiro",Yamada,"A 47-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation after right basal ganglion hematoma. On day 57, he noticed a supernumerary motor phantom limb (SPL) involving his right arm, originating at the level of the elbow. The most notable finding of his SPL was the motor characteristic. When the subject had the intention to move the upper paralyzed limb simultaneously with the trainer's facilitating action, he said ""there is another arm."" The intention to move the paralyzed arm alone or passive movement of the paralyzed arm did not induce the SPL. He showed a severe left sensorimotor impairment and mild hemineglect, but no neglect syndromes of the body (e.g., asomatognosia, somatoparaphrenia, personification and misoplegia, or anosognosia) were observed. Brain MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the right temporal lobe subcortex, subfrontal cortex, putamen, internal capsule, and thalamus. Single-photon emission computed tomography images showed more widespread hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere in comparison to the lesions on MRI. However, the premotor cortex was preserved. Our case is different from Staub's case in that SPL was not induced by the intention to move the paralyzed limb alone; rather, it was induced when the patient intended to move the paralyzed limb with a trainer's simultaneous facilitating action. The SPL may reflect that an abnormal closed-loop function of the thalamocortical system underlies the phantom phenomenon. However, despite the severe motor and sensory impairment, the afferent pathway from the periphery to the premotor cortex may have been partially preserved, and this may have been related to the induction of SPL.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513302,PMC8138257,Intentional motor phantom limb; Premotor cortex; Stroke; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
37786739,"Invisible doppelgänger and body image disorders in right superior parietal lobule stroke, a case series.","Kumral, Emre; Çetin, Fatma E; Dere, Birgül; Özdemir, Hüseyin N",Kumral,"Autoscopic phenomena or an ""invisible doppelgänger"" refer to the illusory reduplication of one's own body. Body image disorder involves distorted perception or decreased body awareness. In the literature, feeling of presence (FOP) is rarely presented with a circumscribed cerebral pathology due to acute vascular lesions, and concomitant FOP and disorders of the body image or the body schema (BIBS) have rarely been reported. We present three cases of both FOP and BIBS disorders. All patients reported the two types of symptoms almost simultaneously: The first patient had the symptom of somatoparaphrenia characterized by deny ownership of the hand and feeling that it does not belong to her, the second patient had the sign of fading limb presented with misuse of his left hand when it was not under visual control and could not mentally represent and locate this part of the body in space, and the third patient had autotopagnosia; he was unable to localize any touched area below the elbow and knee. All patients had right parietal ischemic lesions involving the superior parietal lobule, and two patients had an adjacent additional precuneal involvement. Based on the cases presented here, it is plausible that BIBS may develop in addition to FOP, especially in lesions involving the superior parietal lobule and precuneus.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Ibrain,10.1002/ibra.12057,PMC10528960,asomatognosia; autoscopic phenomena; fading limb; invisible doppelgänger; superior parietal lobule,Case Reports,United States,eng

20812138,Mirrored-self misidentification in a patient without dementia: evidence for right hemispheric and bifrontal damage.,"Villarejo, Alberto; Martin, Verónica Puertas; Moreno-Ramos, Teresa; Camacho-Salas, Ana; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; Bermejo-Pareja, Félix",Villarejo,"Mirrored-self misidentification, often referred as the 'mirror sign', is a delusion characterized by the inability to recognize one's own reflected image, often associated with the intact capacity to recognize others in the mirror. It has been described mainly in moderate or severe dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. In the few reported cases without global cognitive impairment, right hemispheric and frontal dysfunctions have been described. We report a 90-year-old man with abrupt onset of the mirror sign after a minor right hemispheric ischemic stroke. Neuropsychological testing revealed preserved cognitive capacities, except for mild to moderate impairment of visuospatial skills, suggesting right hemisphere dysfunction. Neuroimaging showed a small right dorsolateral frontal infarct, and bifrontal encephalomalacia, consistent with a past history of head trauma. Scattered ischemic white matter lesions in posterior periventricular regions were also seen. It seems that the mirror sign is a multifactorial phenomenon that usually requires right hemispheric dysfunction (perceptual abnormalities, loss of familiarity) and frontal damage (loss of judgement and inability to correct wrong beliefs). The right frontal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seems to have a crucial role in self-recognition.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2010.498427,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
22927899,"Preserved self-awareness following extensive bilateral brain damage to the insula, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortices.","Philippi, Carissa L; Feinstein, Justin S; Khalsa, Sahib S; Damasio, Antonio; Tranel, Daniel; Landini, Gregory; Williford, Kenneth; Rudrauf, David",Philippi,"It has been proposed that self-awareness (SA), a multifaceted phenomenon central to human consciousness, depends critically on specific brain regions, namely the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Such a proposal predicts that damage to these regions should disrupt or even abolish SA. We tested this prediction in a rare neurological patient with extensive bilateral brain damage encompassing the insula, ACC, mPFC, and the medial temporal lobes. In spite of severe amnesia, which partially affected his ""autobiographical self"", the patient's SA remained fundamentally intact. His Core SA, including basic self-recognition and sense of self-agency, was preserved. His Extended SA and Introspective SA were also largely intact, as he has a stable self-concept and intact higher-order metacognitive abilities. The results suggest that the insular cortex, ACC and mPFC are not required for most aspects of SA. Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that SA is likely to emerge from more distributed interactions among brain networks including those in the brainstem, thalamus, and posteromedial cortices.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,PloS one,10.1371/journal.pone.0038413,PMC3425501,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Single-photon emission tomography showed that marked hypoperfusion was not limited to the right posterior capsular region, but also involved the overlying parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent the frontal cortex. At autopsy in 1 patient, the infarct was nearly limited to the deep white matter of the temporal isthmus and the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule; only minute lesions were present in the globus pallidus, body of caudate, and amygdala. These findings are consistent with a disconnection phenomenon as the basis for subcortical neglect with ipsilateral deactivation of the parietofrontal cortex.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410230504,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
16883509,[Tumour of the corpus callosum: the association between interhemispheric disconnection and an anterograde amnesia syndrome].,"Bustamante, J; Lopera, F",Bustamante,"Sperry, or interhemispheric disconnection, syndrome was reported in patients who had undergone surgical section of the corpus callosum carried out in an attempt to control medication-resistant epilepsy. It has occasionally been linked to tumours of the corpus callosum and, although even more rarely, it has also been associated to an amnesic syndrome. In this paper we report the anatomical and neuropsychological findings in a patient with interhemispheric disconnection syndrome associated to a hippocampal-type amnesic syndrome, caused by a tumour in the splenius of the corpus callosum that extended into the fornix. A 52-year-old white male who visited because of loss of memory; on admission to hospital the physical examination revealed a certain degree of asomatognosia with regard to the left-hand side of the body. An axial tomography brain scan showed a dense central lesion in the brain that extended laterally and occluded the body of both lateral ventricles. A biopsy study revealed an undifferentiated astrocytoma that affected the corpus callosum and the fornix. Sperry, or interhemispheric disconnection, syndrome produced by a tumour in the splenius of the corpus callosum is very likely to course with an amnesic syndrome due to disconnection caused by destruction of the fornix. This association, which characterised our patient's clinical picture, has only previously been described in three cases.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,"Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Spain,spa
18641431,Accurate reaching after active but not passive movements of the hand: evidence for forward modeling.,"Branch Coslett, H; Buxbaum, Laurel J; Schwoebel, John",Branch Coslett,"Converging behavioral findings support recent models of motor control suggesting that estimates of the future positions of a limb as well as the expected sensory consequences of a planned movement may be derived, in part, from efference copies of motor commands. These estimates are referred to as forward models. However, relatively little behavioral evidence has been obtained for proposed forward models that provide on-line estimates of current position. We report data from a patient (JD) who reached accurately to visualized targets with and without vision of her hand despite substantial proprioceptive loss. Additionally, we administered a double-start reaching test to examine the possibility that efference copy information could be used to estimate current limb position. JD reached accurately, without vision, to a final target after actively reaching to a landmark, but exhibited severely impaired reaching after passive movements to the landmark. This finding suggests that forward modeling of efference copy signals may provide relatively accurate estimates of current limb position for the purpose of motor planning. The possibility that such estimates may also contribute to the awareness of body position and to self-recognition is discussed.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2008/972542,PMC5452459,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Netherlands,eng
12657477,[Asomatognosia and oral drive: a psychoanalytical perspective].,"Morin, C; Durand, E; Marchal, F; Timsit, S; Manai, R; Pradat-Diehl, P; Rancurel, G",Morin,"The psychoanalytic concept of specular image refers to the complex construction that associates the body image with the language coordinates of the individual, thus making him/her a human subject. The acquisition of this specular image implies the loss of corporeal exchanges between mother and child, i.e., the ""neutralization"" of those body parts or extensions where these exchanges take place. These conceptions of body image and subjectivity lead to the hypothesis that neurological disturbances of body schema may alter the patients' subjectivity and their relation to the lost ""object"" insofar as they alter body image. In the present paper, we present two patients aged under 50, with a unique first ever stroke due to ischemia in the right middle cerebral artery territory and asomatognosia. On one hand, Bisiach's protocol was used to assess hemiplegia, sensory troubles, visual troubles, hemineglect and anosognosia, and adapted to assess asomatognosia. On the other hand, subjective data were gathered during a semistructured interview and a self-portrait test. This showed that asomatognosia was accompanied by a destructuration of body image and aberrant oral manifestations involving the paralyzed hand. The psychological positive phenomena accompanying asomatognosia might correspond to the intrusion of the lost object in the patients' psychic reality, due to the alteration of body schema and body image.",{},,Annales de readaptation et de medecine physique : revue scientifique de la Societe francaise de reeducation fonctionnelle de readaptation et de medecine physique,10.1016/s0168-6054(02)00307-0,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,fre
10097398,Does vestibular stimulation activate thalamocortical mechanisms that reintegrate impaired cortical regions?,"Schiff, N D; Pulver, M",Schiff,"Caloric stimulation induced a transient reversal of multimodal hemispatial cognitive deficits in an 81-year-old woman with an acute left cerebral hemisphere stroke. The patient had unawareness of her right hand (asomatognosia), right-sided visual unawareness (hemineglect), aphasia and right-sided weakness (hemiplegia) prior to the stimulation. Transient improvements in impaired sensory, motor, linguistic and cognitive function developed within 30 s following application of the caloric stimulus and onset of horizontal nystagmus. The effect persisted for 3 min and ceased completely after 5 min. While several recent reports have described the capacity of caloric stimulation to transiently improve or reverse a wide range of attentional, cognitive and motor impairments, most examples are in right-hemisphere-damaged patients with long-standing brain injury. Typically, patients have been tested several months or years after the onset of the deficit.

9046530,[A case with dressing apraxia].,"Hayakawa, Y; Suzuki, K; Fujii, T; Yamadori, A",Hayakawa,"A 56-year-old right-handed man developed a persistent dressing apraxia after a cerebral infarction. On examination eight months after the onset, he showed an extreme difficulty in dressing, which did not improve even after repeated trials. He also showed poor judgement of line orientation, impaired ability on constructive task, and prominent difficulty in right-left discrimination of objects placed in front of him. Interestingly, his right left orientation about his own body was not impaired. Mild left unilateral neglect and left sided visual extinction on double simultaneous stimuli were also present. No other neuropsychological signs including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, asomatognosia and anosognosia were present. The detailed experimental investigations showed that his visual imagery and its mental operation were severely impaired. For instance, he was unable to rotate an imagery object in his mind. We concluded that his dressing impairment was inherently related with this difficulty in rotating an imagery object in the mind.
