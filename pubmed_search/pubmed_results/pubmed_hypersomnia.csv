We report a case of probable apatinib-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy in a 69-year-old male. The patient received apatinib as targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma and presented with acute confusion and hypersomnolence after four days of medication initiation. He showed improvement on drug withdrawal; then he resumed apatinib with a half dose and had a recurrence. Possible underlying mechanisms that include direct neuronal effect and antiangiogenic properties are discussed. We would like to draw attention to the potential risk of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy even with a low dosage. Clinicians should be aware of any unexplained neurological syndrome after the initiation of apatinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,10.1177/1078155219846253,,Adverse drug reaction; apatinib; hepatic carcinoma; hyperammonemic encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In anti-Ma2 encephalitis, hypersomnia appears to be frequent. However, only few cases of type 1 narcolepsy have been reported to date with anti-Ma2 encephalitis. We report 2 new cases of patients with narcolepsy secondary to anti-Ma2 encephalitis. Patient 1, a 68-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 1, including sleep attacks, cataplexy, abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests and hypocretin-1 deficiency (< 50 ng/L) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), associated with a cerebellar syndrome. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF and antivoltage-gated potassium channel antibodies in the serum. He benefited from a treatment with pitolisant. Patient 2, a 42-year-old man, had narcolepsy type 2, including hypersomnolence, no cataplexy, intermediate CSF levels of hypocretin-1 (138 ng/L), abnormal Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, and a limbic encephalitis presentation. Anti-Ma2 antibodies were present in the serum and CSF, and anti-Ma1 antibodies were in the CSF. For both, repeated polysomnographies were necessary to establish the precise diagnosis of central hypersomnia, emphasizing the importance of carrying out sleep investigations in a tertiary neurology center with sleep medicine expertise in patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

35360167,Case Report: Dysfunction of the Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus Area Induces Hypersomnia in Patients.,"Wang, Zan; Zhong, Yu-Heng; Jiang, Shan; Qu, Wei-Min; Huang, Zhi-Li; Chen, Chang-Rui",Wang,"Hypersomnia is a common and highly impairing symptom marked by pathological excessive sleepiness, which induces suboptimal functioning and poor quality of life. Hypersomnia can be both a primary (e.g., hypersomnolence disorder) and secondary (e.g., tumors, and head trauma) symptom of disorders. However, its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We report that three clinical cases with lesions around the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) area showed excessive daytime sleepiness and a prolonged nocturnal sleep lasting more than 20 h per day. Sleep architecture and subjective daytime sleepiness were examined by polysomnography. These cases were presented with stroke, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody associated disorders and neuromyelitis optical spectrum disorder (NMOSD), respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions around the PVH area in all these three patients. After treatment of their primary disorders, their excessive sleep decreased as the PVH area recovered. Our findings suggest that the PVH may play an essential role in the occurrence of hypersomnia.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neuroscience,10.3389/fnins.2022.830474,PMC8964012,case report; hypersomnia; lesion; magnetic resonance imaging; polysomnography; the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We present the MR imaging findings in two cases with cerebral infarction caused by Percheron artery occlusion. Due to the difficulty in the diagnosis of acute Percheron arterial infarction, early conservative treatment is used. The prognosis of the disease is poor, with few patients completely rehabilitating. Therefore, clinicians must understand the characteristics of the disease, provide early diagnosis and administer timely and effective treatment to reduce the patient's disability rate and fatality rate and therefore improve the quality of life of patients.

22136879,[Hypothalamic involvement in multiple sclerosis].,"Darlix, A; Mathey, G; Monin, M-L; Sauvée, M; Braun, M; Schaff, J-L; Debouverie, M",Darlix,"Hypothalamic involvement is a rare condition in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). We report two patients with a long history of MS who presented with severe acute hypothermia with associated thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase levels. Several cases of hypothermia or hyperthermia in patients with MS have been reported in the literature. They could be linked with hypothalamic lesions, in particular in the pre-optic area. However, other anatomical locations seem to be involved in thermoregulation and can be affected by MS. Besides, some cases of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion have been reported in patients with MS. Finally, some sleep disorders, particularly hypersomnia or narcolepsy, could be related to hypothalamic lesions, through the fall in hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Hypocretin-1 is a neuropeptide that is secreted by some hypothalamic cells. It plays a role in the sleep-awake rhythm. We report one patient with narcolepsy and cataplexy before the first symptoms of MS appeared. Hypothalamic signs are rare in MS. However, several series of autopsies have shown a high frequency of demyelinating lesions in the hypothalamic area. Among these lesions, the proportion of active lesions seems elevated. Yet only few of them have a clinical or biological translation such as thermoregulation dysfunction, sleep disorders or natremia abnormalities. Thus, it seems unlikely that inflammatory hypothalamic lesions alone, even when bilateral, could be the explanation of these signs. A sufficient number of inflammatory demyelinating lesions, which we can observe in patients with a long history of MS and an already severe disability, is probably necessary to develop such a rare symptomatology. Hypothalamic signs might be a factor of poor prognosis for the disease course and progression of the disability.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2011.09.004,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

It is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands. In the setting of pSS, the presence of systemic disease is an important prognostic determinant, but involvement of the kidney is uncommon. The triad of pSS, distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is rare and potentially fatal. A 42-year-old woman presented with dRTA, profound hypokalemia, and CPM characterized by progressive global quadriparesis, ophthalmoplegia, and encephalopathy.

Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe. A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more. The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out. General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications. We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3). The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area.

20714032,[Anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis].,"Yamamoto, Tomotaka; Tsuji, Shoji",Yamamoto,"Anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis (or anti-Ma2 encephalitis) is a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) characterized by isolated or combined limbic, diencephalic, or brainstem dysfunction. Anti-Ma2 antibodies detected in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of patients are highly specific for this disease entity and belong to a group of well-characterized onconeuronal antibodies (or classical antibodies). The corresponding antigen, Ma2 is selectively expressed intracellularly in neurons and tumors as is the case with other onconeuronal antigens targeted by classical antibodies. However, in most cases the clinical pictures are different from those of classical PNS and this creates a potential risk of underdiagnosis. Although limbic dysfunction is the most common manifestation in patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis which is one of the major causes of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (LE), it has been reported that less than 30% of the patients with anti-Ma2 LE exhibit clinical presentations typical of the classical description of LE. Of the remaining, many exhibit excessive daytime sleepiness, vertical ophthalmoparesis, or both associated with LE, because of frequent involvement of the diencephalon and/or upper brainstem. Anti-Ma2 LE can also be manifested as a pure psychiatric disturbance such as obsessive-compulsive disorder in a few cases. Some patients develop mesodiencephalic encephalitis with minor involvement of the limbic system, and some may manifest severe hypokinesis. About 40% of the patients with anti-Ma2 antibodies also have antibodies against different epitopes on Ma1, a homologue of Ma2. These patients may have predominant cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunctions due to more extensive involvement of subtentorial structures. Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is outstanding among other PNS associated with classical antibodies in that the response rate to treatment is relatively high. While it can cause severe neurological deficits or death in a substantial proportion of the patients, approximately one-third show neurological improvement and another 20 - 40% stabilize in response to treatment, including immunotherapy and/or tumor treatment. Patients who have limited CNS involvement and testicular tumors with complete response to therapy are more likely to show neurological improvement. This fact emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy. However, it should be noted that even carcinoma in situ, which is difficult to detect can cause severe neurological disorders. In this respect, it is useful to highlight that anti-Ma2 encephalitis is almost always associated with testicular germ cell tumors in men younger than 50 years. We experienced a 40-year-old patient with severe hypokinesis caused by anti-Ma2 encephalitis associated with bilateral intratubular germ-cell neoplasm of the testes. In older men and women, non-small-cell lung cancer is most common but various types of cancers are reported to be associated. In this study,in addition to reviewing the above case we have reviewed the significance of anti-Ma2 antibodies in the diagnosis of anti-Ma2 encephalitis and the clinical features of this disease.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Acute episodes are also seen with withdrawal from alcohol or sedative-hypnotics, and the use of tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants. In this article, we present a case of olanzapine treatment of a patient with cerebrovascular disease with psychobehavioural symptoms. The patient was an elderly patient who developed psychobehavioural symptoms after a sudden cerebral infarction. Initially, his symptoms improved when he took olanzapine (5 mg orally once/night). However, the patient subsequently developed symptoms of hypersomnia when he continued to take olanzapine, and the symptoms of hypersomnia gradually worsened as the dose of olanzapine was gradually increased. Benzodiazepines are often used to treat anomalous sleep, and clonazepam is one of the commonly prescribed drugs. In this case, the patient's abnormal sleep behavior was alleviated after treatment with clonazepam. As an atypical antipsychotic drug, olanzapine has been reported to cause abnormal sleep behavior during clinical use, and only one case has been reported in China. Clinicians should be aware that heteromorphic sleep can occur in patients treated with olanzapine.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.1266204,PMC10765984,RBD (rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder); adverse reactions; anomalous sleep; cerebrovascular disease; olanzapine,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Encephalitis manifested with persistent hiccups, seizures and impairment of consciousness. After 2 weeks, the initial neurologic symptoms subsided and the patient progressively developed movement disorders (rigidity and bradykinesia, resistant to L-DOPA), lethargy and behavioral hypersomnia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed thalamic and hippocampal signal abnormalities, immunohistochemistry on a mouse brain substrate revealed serum autoantibodies binding to the brainstem neuropil. Polysomnographic monitoring was consistent with a very severe disruption of sleep: the sleep-wake cycle was fragmented, and the NREM-REM ultradian cycle was irregular. Intravenous immune globulin therapy resulted in the complete reversal of the movement and the sleep disorders. Our observation confirms that parkinsonism and sleep disorders may be consequences of encephalitis, that an immune-mediated pathogenesis is likely, and, consequently, that immunotherapy can be beneficial in these patients. The polysomnographic monitoring suggests that lethargia, rather than a mere hypersomnia, is the result of a combination between sleep disruption and altered motor control.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059416645706,,encephalitis; encephalitis lethargica; hypersomnia; immunoglobuline; polysomnography; post-encephalitic parkinsonism; sleep,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Because of the nonspecific presentation and the typically deep-seated location of cerebral lesions in these patients, definitive diagnosis is frequently problematic. We present the first reported use of stereotaxy-guided brain biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of isolated intracranial Whipple's disease. The patient was a 36-year-old man who presented with a 4-month history of progressive lethargy, hypersomnia, behavioral changes, and weight gain. The results of the physical examination were remarkable only for findings of hypogonadism. Subsequent laboratory evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, with low levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, cortisol, and prolactin. A magnetic resonance image of the brain demonstrated hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images in the regions of the right fornix, hypothalamus, and putamen that subsequently enhanced with intravenously administered contrast medium. A biopsy was then obtained from the right putaminal lesion under stereotactic guidance. Histopathological analysis of the tissue revealed findings consistent with intracerebral Whipple's disease that were subsequently confirmed using electron microscopy. Intracerebral Whipple's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with progressive dementia and cognitive decline. In these patients, lesions have typically been observed in the hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, insular cortex, and cerebellum. As evidenced by our case, stereotaxy affords clinicians the attractive option of a minimally invasive technique by which to obtain tissue from such deep-seated areas.

Previously, the patient had received corticosteroid therapy for unconfirmed ANCA-associated vasculitis. Physical examination revealed a painless chancre on the left arm located at the site of an old insect bite, enlarged cervical, axillar and inguinal lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly and impaired concentration. Blood analysis showed an elevated protein level (90g/L) with hypoalbuminemia (24.2g/L) and elevated IgM (26.4g/L). Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy failed to detect any parasite. Polymerase chain reaction tests on blood and cerebrospinal fluid were positive for Trypanosoma. Serology tests confirmed the diagnosis of HAT due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection. 3T MRI showed lesions in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia, the internal capsule, and the mesencephalon bilaterally. Follow-up MRI showed interval progression of the abnormalities. Treatment with melarsoprol was followed by clinical improvement with regression of the lesions on the three-month MRI, then total resolution at the 10-month follow-up. This case highlights a pattern of mild MRI lesions in T. brucei gambiense HAT with a total and rapid resolution under treatment.

Antibodies targeting contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), a component of voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex, have been documented to be associated with a novel autoimmune synaptic encephalitis with a low incidence. Herein, we reported an adult female with initial presentation of decreased vision in the right eye and subsequent episodes of neuropsychiatric disturbance including hypersomnia, agitation, apatheia, and memory impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple lesions scattered in brain, brainstem, and cervical and thoracic spinal cord, showing hypointensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Heterogenous patchy or ring-like enhancement was observed in the majority of lesions. The detection of low-titer MOG-IgG exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; titer, 1:1) and Caspr2-IgG in both serum and CSF (titers, 1:100 and 1:1) led to a possible diagnosis of coexisting MOG-IgG-associated disease (MOGAD) and anti-Caspr2 antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive agents including corticosteroids and immunoglobulin, and achieved a sustained remission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the possible coexistence of MOGAD and anti-Caspr2 antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitis, which advocates for the recommendation of a broad spectrum screening for antibodies against well-defined CNS antigens in suspected patients with autoimmune-mediated diseases of the CNS.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Therapeutic advances in neurological disorders,10.1177/1756286420969462,PMC7605028,MOG-IgG-associated disease; autoimmune; contactin-associated protein-like 2; encephalitis; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein,Case Reports,England,eng

Marked cerebral vasculopathy with subsequent white matter lesions (WML) are a frequent finding in FD patients. Recent studies discussed an association between cerebral white matter changes and sleep-related disturbances of breathing, which may lead to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). A 56-year-old Caucasian female FD patient with EDS was admitted to our sleep laboratory. Overnight polysomnography showed a Cheyne-Stokes respiration pattern with significant O(2) desaturation. MR imaging revealed confluent WML including the brain stem, but no renal or cardiac involvement. We then evaluated the clinical data of 49 genetically proven FD patients (27 males; mean age 43 years) from our FD centre. With a frequency of 68%, EDS exceeds the prevalence of other common symptoms of FD (angiokeratomas 61%; acroparaesthesia 51%; renal involvement 29%; cardiac involvement 27%), and the prevalence of chronic fatigue (48%). EDS was independently associated with the physical component summary of the SF-36 data (corrected R(2) = -0.323, p < 0.001). EDS and age explained a quarter of variance in mental component summary (corrected R(2) = -0.253, p < 0.001). We conclude that EDS is a common and underdiagnosed symptom in FD patients, accompanied by a significant impact on quality of life. EDS might be caused by central breathing disorders due to an affection of brain regions associated with respiratory control in FD.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000226792,PMC2940262,,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

There was a clear positive relationship between quality of sleep, language processing, attention and memory, seen across the phases of the medication intervention (p < 0.01). A comprehensive pharmacological management programme addressing the multi-factorial underlying aetiology was successful in improving sleep, arousal and mood. The D-CCASP was found to be clinically and statistically sensitive to reported changes in cognitive-communication function in relation to improvements in sleep and daytime arousal. These findings suggest that management of sleep/wake disturbances and mood post-traumatic brain injury can potentially facilitate improvements in cognitive-communication function which may, in turn, facilitate participation in rehabilitation and community integration.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2011.608215,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

He was found to have right CN 3 paralysis and bitemporal hemianopsia on neurological examination. Further workup revealed panhypopituitarism. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large solid retrochiasmatic hypothalamic lesion with homogeneous contrast enhancement, measuring 2.1 × 2.6 × 2.4 cm. Optic chiasm was prefixed, and the tumor was just posterior to the pituitary stalk area. The preoperative differential diagnosis included hypothalamic astrocytoma, craniopharyngioma, germinoma, and histiocytosis. Because of the prefixed chiasm, a presigmoid, transpetrosal approach was performed. Our initial plan was a large biopsy, but based on frozen section histology, we decided to excise the tumor completely. The tumor had a pseudocapsule, which was firm and yellowish. It was debulked, dissected from the surrounding hypothalamus, and removed completely. The pituitary stalk was found at the anterior and inferior ends of the tumor and was preserved.  Postoperatively, the patient developed diabetes insipidus and requires desmopressin replacement, which was gradually tapered. For panhypopituitarism, he is receiving thyroxine, hydrocortisone, and testosterone.  Postoperatively, patient had an improvement in vision in his left eye and ptosis was improving in the right eye with mRs 1- at 10-wk follow-up.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the surgery, which included videotaping of the procedure and its distribution for educational purposes.

34079509,Case Report: An MRI Traumatic Brain Injury Longitudinal Case Study at 7 Tesla: Pre- and Post-injury Structural Network and Volumetric Reorganization and Recovery.,"Brown, Stephanie S G; Dams-O'Connor, Kristen; Watson, Eric; Balchandani, Priti; Feldman, Rebecca E",Brown,"<b>Importance:</b> A significant limitation of many neuroimaging studies examining mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the unavailability of pre-injury data. <b>Objective:</b> We therefore aimed to utilize pre-injury ultra-high field brain MRI and compare a collection of neuroimaging metrics pre- and post-injury to determine mTBI related changes and evaluate the enhanced sensitivity of high-resolution MRI. <b>Design:</b> In the present case study, we leveraged multi-modal 7 Tesla MRI data acquired at two timepoints prior to mTBI (23 and 12 months prior to injury), and at two timepoints post-injury (2 weeks and 8 months after injury) to examine how a right parietal bone impact affects gross brain structure, subcortical volumetrics, microstructural order, and connectivity. <b>Setting:</b> This research was carried out as a case investigation at a single primary care site. <b>Participants:</b> The case participant was a 38-year-old female selected for inclusion based on a mTBI where a right parietal impact was sustained. <b>Main outcomes:</b> The main outcome measurements of this investigation were high spatial resolution structural brain metrics including volumetric assessment and connection density of the white matter connectome. <b>Results:</b> At the first scan timepoint post-injury, the cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter in both hemispheres appeared to be volumetrically reduced compared to the pre-injury and subsequent post-injury scans. Connectomes produced from whole-brain diffusion-weighted probabilistic tractography showed a widespread decrease in connectivity after trauma when comparing mean post-injury and mean pre-injury connection densities. Findings of reduced fractional anisotropy in the cerebral white matter of both hemispheres at post-injury time point 1 supports reduced connection density at a microstructural level. Trauma-related alterations to whole-brain connection density were markedly reduced at the final scan timepoint, consistent with symptom resolution. <b>Conclusions and Relevance:</b> This case study investigates the structural effects of traumatic brain injury for the first time using pre-injury and post-injury 7 Tesla MRI longitudinal data. We report findings of initial volumetric changes, decreased structural connectivity and reduced microstructural order that appear to return to baseline 8 months post-injury, demonstrating in-depth metrics of physiological recovery. Default mode, salience, occipital, and executive function network alterations reflect patient-reported hypersomnolence, reduced cognitive processing speed and dizziness.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.631330,PMC8165156,7T MRI; case study; diffusion MRI; structural connectivity; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

It is important to differentiate CSWS from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) as their management differs. CSWS leads to hypovolemia as opposed to euvolemia or hypervolemia in SIADH. SIADH is managed with fluid restriction and this could worsen CSWS which is managed with adminstration of intravenous crystalloids to correct hyponatremia. A 42-year-old male was admitted after a week of low-grade fever with easy fatigability, hypersomnolence, and excessive thirst. He had polyuria which started 5 days before presentation, and unintentionally lost 3 kg of weight in the past month. He had orthostatic hypotension, and was dehydrated, but vital signs were normal with the exception of his temperature. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a glucose of 42 mg/dl, protein 170 mg/dl, cell count 28/mm<sup>3</sup> with 65% lymphocytes which was consistant with tubercular meningitis. CSF AFB culture was positive in addition to a positive CSF PCR for <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Presentation of CNS infection with tuberculosis may be non-specific and its insidious onset could lead to delayed or missed diagnosis; however persistent constitutional symptoms and signs with history of weight loss and a close contact with tuberculosis may raise the possibility of tuberculosis. Early diagnosis and treatment has an excellent prognosis, but any delay contributes to death and disability despite anti-tubercular drug therapy.CSWS should be managed with salt and volume replacement, but more importantly, the causative CNS insult should also be confirmed and addressed.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.008,PMC7677114,"Tuberculosis, Tubercular meningitis, Cerebral salt wasting syndrome(CSWS),SIADH, Nepal",Case Reports,England,eng

Occasionally, they present with focal neurologic deficits, a dementia-like syndrome, hemorrhage, or ischemic infarction. This study is based on the case of a 71-year-old gentleman who presented with 6 months of progressive forgetfulness, inattention, and hypersomnolence. Four weeks prior to presentation, he developed symptoms of left-sided pain, numbness, and worsening weakness. Neurologic examination demonstrated hypersomnolence, a score of 30/38 on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and left hemiparesis. MRI brain revealed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities with associated enhancement. MR venogram (MRV) showed a vascular malformation in the posterior fossa and occlusion of the straight sinus. Conventional cerebral angiogram confirmed a tentorial dAVF. The dAVF was definitively treated with transarterial embolization, followed by clip ligation of the arterialized draining vein. Twelve weeks later, there was clinical resolution of left hemiparesis and improvement in cognitive status. MRI revealed complete resolution of the thalamic hyperintensities. MRV demonstrated recanalization of the straight sinus. Intracranial dAVFs are uncommon but potentially life-threatening acquired vascular malformations. The initiating factor is venous hypertension, causing retrograde flow, venous congestion, ischemia, and sometimes infarction. The spectrum of clinical manifestations in dAVFs reflects the degree of venous congestion present. If retrograde venous flow is surgically obliterated, then venous hypertension may be reversible. Bilateral thalamic venous congestion can present as a thalamic dementia. We conclude that intracranial dAVFs with thalamic venous congestion should be considered in the diagnostic differential for patients who present with subacute cognitive decline and T2 hyperintense thalamic signal change.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9746-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We present a clinical case of a unique presentation of AOP infarction associated with paradoxical embolism and highlight the atypical clinical manifestations and challenging diagnosis of this stroke syndrome. A 58-year-old White female with chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis was admitted to our center with a 10-hour course of hypersomnolence and right-sided ataxia. She had normal body temperature, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and heart rate and scored 11 points in the Glasgow Coma Scale and 12 points in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Initial brain computerized tomography scan, electrocardiogram, and thoracic radiography were normal; transcranial Doppler ultrasound showed >50% stenosis at the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, and transthoracic echocardiogram, a patent foramen ovale and thrombus adherent to the hemodialysis catheter. On day 3, she underwent brain magnetic resonance that showed acute ischemic lesions at the paramedian thalami and the superior cerebral peduncles. AOP infarction due to a paradoxical embolism from a patent foramen ovale with a right atrial thrombus was the final diagnosis. AOP infarctions are a rare type of stroke with elusive clinical presentations and frequently, initial imaging assessment is normal.

After the acute stroke phase, hypersomnolence improved and sleep spindles reappeared as well as phase 3 and 4 of NREM sleep. Our patient clear clinical and polysomnographic improvement makes us suppose that in this case the initial impairment could have been essentially due to a functional transitory impairment of the thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections.

The assessment revealed impaired performance on measures of orientation, memory, executive function, and language, as well as symptoms including hallucinations, apathy, and hypersomnolence, consistent with thalamic dementia. Remarkably, in this context, the patient maintained an ability to play piano and read music. The case has implications for understanding the complex integrative functions of the thalamus, including how profound impairment can simultaneously present with cognitive strengths that may not be captured by performance on neuropsychological testing. This case also suggests that magnetic resonance imaging may be indicated in cases presenting with vascular risk factors and sudden onset cognitive impairment, given that computed tomography may not be sensitive to small subcortical infarcts.",{},,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,10.1093/arclin/acad069,,Case report; Dementia; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Music; Neuropsychological assessment; Thalamic stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A range of underlying conditions can lead to this clinical syndrome. Rapid diagnosis to initiate treatment early is key to a beneficial outcome. We report the case of a 22 year old Afro-Caribbean woman, who presented with a two -week history of walking difficulties, upper limb incoordination and slurred speech. Her brainstem function deteriorated at pace, and she developed hypersomnia. A broad diagnostic approach led to prophylactic treatment for the most common infectious causes. This did not improve her symptoms. Non-infectious inflammatory causes were therefore considered and plasma exchange treatment was initiated leading to marked improvement within days. Screening for autoimmune conditions confirmed aquaporin-4 positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) as the underlying cause. Immunotherapy with rituximab was started. So far, no relapse has been observed. While the definition of NMOSD continues to be refined, aquaporin-4 testing should be considered early in patients presenting with rhomboencephalitis who do not respond to antibiotic and antiviral treatment.

Mean age (+/- SD) at presentation was 37.4 (+/- 9.1) yr (range 18-54); 73.7% of the patients (n = 14) were female. Mean age of sleep-related eating onset was 24.7 (+/- 12.9) yr (range 5-44). Eating occurred from sleep nightly in 57.9% (n = 11) of patients. Chief complaints included excessive weight gain, concerns about choking while eating or about starting fires from cooking and sleep disruption. Extensive polysomnographic studies, clinical evaluations and treatment outcome data identified three etiologic categories for the sleep-related eating: (a) sleepwalking (SW), 84.2% (n = 16); (b) periodic movements of sleep (PMS), 10.5% (n = 2) and (c) triazolam abuse (0.75 mg hs), 5.3% (n = 1). DSM-III Axis 1 psychiatric disorders (affective, anxiety) were present in 47.4% (n = 9) of the patients, and only two patients had a daytime eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), each in remission for 3-7 yr. Nearly half of all patients fulfilled established criteria for being overweight, based on the body mass index. Onset of sleep-related eating was linked directly to the onset of SW, PMS, triazolam abuse, nicotine abstinence, chronic autoimmune hepatitis, narcolepsy, encephalitis or acute stress. In the SW group, 72.7% (8/11) of patients had nocturnal eating and other SW behavior suppressed by clonazepam (n = 7) and/or bromocriptine (n = 2) treatment. Both patients with PMS likewise responded to treatment with combinations of carbidopa/L-dopa, codeine and clonazepam.

This tremor is usually related to lesions in the midbrain peduncular region involving the superior cerebellar peduncle, the red nucleus, and possibly the nigrostriatal circuitry. Common etiologies resulting in HT include tumor, ischemia, and demyelination. We report a case of progressive left-sided HT in an otherwise healthy man with additional symptoms of parkinsonism, hypoesthesia, right oculomotor nerve palsy, cognitive dysfunction, and hypersomnolence. Imaging investigations revealed a right-sided thalamic and midbrain glioma. Dopamine transport imaging demonstrated significant dopaminergic denervation in the right caudate and putamen. The degree of striatal dopamine transporter deficiency was more severe than expected in a patient with Parkinson disease. A trial of dopaminergic agent resulted in significant improvement of the tremor and associated symptoms. Interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway can occur in cases of HT because of midbrain peduncular lesion. The striatal dopaminergic function imaging may have a role in assessing presynaptic dopamine dysfunction and guiding treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000201000,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The dog was started on immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone and cytosine arabinoside, which was subsequently switched to cyclosporine. Narcolepsy-cataplexy episodes could initially still be triggered by offering food; however, they gradually became shorter and less frequent until they completely subsided along with all other clinical signs after 3 wk. No relapse occurred over a 32 mo follow-up period from the diagnosis. Repeated MRI revealed marked reduction in the lesion size; cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormalities.

Visual functions were normal, with one exception: a psychophysical test of motion perception revealed a significant deficit in the detection of vertical movements. This could be due to a central adaptive mechanism which, in order to minimize oscillopsia, might elevate thresholds for vertical motion perception in cases of vertical gaze palsy.

Combined lesion of the paramedian thalamus and mesencephalon bilaterally is extremely rare. Little is known about the breathing disturbances of the particular region due to the lesion. The following describes the specific case of a woman, age 62, with bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic stroke. Initially, the patient's complaints exhibited altered vigilance and vertical gaze palsy. Notably, following the acute phase, fluctuating hypersomnia was detected. The MRI (brain) revealed an ischemic lesion in the medial part of the mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus, bilaterally. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the involvement and characteristics of sleep-related breathing abnormalities in the clinical manifestation of the combined paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic stroke. Polysomnographic recordings were accomplished seven times with 1-week interval between the consecutive recordings, toward investigating the early changes of sleep and sleep-related breathing abnormalities. Sleep structure examination featured a decrease in N3 and REM ratio and an increase in N1 and N2 ratio with minimal improvement during the recovery period. In contrast, significant changes were found in the breathing pattern: the initial central apnea dominance was followed by obstructive apneas with a gradual decrease of the total pathological respiratory events. In addition to the structural abnormality of the sleep regulating network, sleep-disordered breathing is another possible cause of hypersomnia in patients afflicted with the present localization of the lesion.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,10.1007/s11325-015-1212-0,,Central apnea; Hypersomnia; Mesencephalon; Obstructive apnea; Paramedian thalamus; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

General autopsy failed to identify a primary neoplasm or an anatomic cause of death. Investigation of sudden respiratory cessation was a consideration when undertaking an anatomic study of the brain. Review of patient records and careful examination of the brain following autopsy were carried out. The patient had terminal episodes of hypersomnia but episodes of sleep apnea were not observed. She received no respiratory support and no respiratory difficulties were recorded until she was pronounced dead at 7 a.m. Autopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma in a pattern suggestive of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, including multiple cerebral metastases, although no significant pulmonary lesions of any type were found. A 0.2 cm metastatic adenocarcinoma was found in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). No other tumor was present in the brain stem. Unilateral destruction of the NTS in the medulla would have severely disturbed the most critical point of convergence of autonomic and voluntary respiratory control and of cardiocirculatory reflexes in the central autonomic network. It is postulated that this caused respiratory arrest during a state transition from sleeping to waking. Few metastases to the medulla are reported, most are relatively large, and several have caused respiratory symptoms before death. The very small metastasis in our patient could be the direct anatomic cause of death, and as such it is an unusual complication of metastatic disease of which clinicians should be aware. It is speculated that dysfunction of direct NTS connections to the pons or of connections passing close to the metastatic deposit resulted in terminal hypersomnia.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

To determine whether unilateral infarction of the paramedian thalamus leads to changes in excitability of ipsilesional primary motor hand area (M1). We describe a patient with chronic stroke of the right dorsomedian and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, who suffered from mild persistent hypersomnia. We studied the excitability of the right and left M1 with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the patient, and in 10 healthy controls. In contrast to healthy controls, contralateral electrical stimulation of the median nerve failed to induce short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in the ipsilesional M1. Other measures of corticomotor excitability and somatosensory evoked potentials were normal. The selective loss of ipsilateral SAI in a patient with paramedian thalamic stroke suggests that during wakefulness, the intact paramedian thalamus facilitates the excitability of intracortical inhibitory circuits, which process thalamocortical sensory inputs in the ipsilateral M1. This preliminary finding suggests that measurements of SAI may provide a means of probing the integrity of some neural pathways, which are involved in the control of wakefulness and arousal. In addition to the established role of the paramedian thalamus in arousal and memory, our observation suggests that thalamocortical projections from the paramedian thalamus contribute to the integration of sensory input at the cortical level during wakefulness.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1016/j.clinph.2005.07.015,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

14611920,Behavioural disturbances following Japanese B encephalitis.,"Monnet, François P",Monnet,"Clinically, Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) is often overlooked as its occurrence in Western countries is rare. However, its neurological, cognitive and psychiatric sequelae constitute a major public health problem in the Far East where JBE is endemic. European and American subjects may however experience the JBE when returning from a Far East journey. In such cases, misdiagnosis is frequent because of the unawareness of psychiatrists and physicians. The present review, therefore, documents the behavioural and cognitive sequelae of JBE. This reactivates the debate concerning the vaccination against the virus all the more that the literature enlightens the importance of the vaccination for those who undertake frequent and extensive tourist excursions to the Orient but still discusses it for occasional travellers. Following is a case-report of a young western European post-graduate student who has contracted JBE by experiencing an acute febrile delirium during an unusual short stay in South East Asia. Pyramidal syndrome, Parkinsonism and amnesia were the prominent acute deficits. Whereas these faded in great part during convalescence, emotional and behavioural instability associated with affective involvement, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and cognitive impairments appeared. A partial recovery was however obtained with neuroleptics, lithium and following electro-convulsive therapy. Organic personality syndrome was persistent and thereafter constituted the main sequelae syndrome.

Dilatation of VRSs is visible on magnetic resonance images in asymptomatic individuals. However, giant dilatation of VRSs (dVRSs) is very rare. Such giant dVRSs may produce a pressure effect on surrounding structures and can be confused with more sinister conditions such as cystic neoplasm. We describe a 30-year-old man who presented with complaints of headache, poor attention and concentration, forgetfulness, polyuria, urinary incontinence for past 3 years and hypersomnia for 3 months. He was found to have a multicystic lesion in the midbrain with extension into the third ventricle, causing hydrocephalus due to aqueductal obstruction. Although at first look, the radiologic features suggested a cystic neoplasm, a careful magnetic resonance imaging evaluation helped to establish the correct diagnosis of dVRS. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy resolved his symptoms. Dilatation of VRS may produce multicystic giant lesions that can easily be confused with other pathologic condition that have a completely different prognosis and management. Knowledge about the existence of such an entity and their radiologic features is important to prevent such misdiagnosis and mismanagement in the form of biopsy/excision, which can have devastating consequences.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.07.010,,Dilated; Giant; Mesencephalic; Virchow Robin spaces,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This finding was corroborated by decreased hypocretin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the manifestation of diabetes insipidus. Screening for anti-glycolipid antibody profiles showed the selective increase of serum anti-Gal-C antibody. After treatment with minocyclin, the patient's daytime sleepiness was markedly improved and the CSF hypocretin-1 level became almost normal, as well. It is known that CSF hypocretin-1 is decreased in Guillain-Barré syndrome mediated by anti-glycolipid antibody, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between anti-glycolipid antibodies and hypothalamic involvement.

In addition to presenting our own case, we performed a PubMed search to comprehensively illustrate demographics, hemorrhage patterns, and treatment outcomes for these lesions. We found 12 patients with basilar perforator artery aneurysms. Mean patient age was 47.3, and there was a 3:1 male to female predominance. All patients had ruptured aneurysms, though all were clinically low or medium grade (I-III). Six patients had diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and six had prepontine and/or perimesencephalic hemorrhage patterns. All aneurysms arose off middle or rostral basilar perforator arteries; mean aneurysm size was 4.5 mm. All except one was partially thrombosed, and 4 out of 12 patients did not have their aneurysms detected on initial angiography (33%). Seven were treated surgically, two were coiled, and three were observed. At last follow-up, all were occluded, and 8 out of 12 patients were neurologically intact (67%). Of seven patients that were not treated with early intervention, one suffered a rebleed over a combined total of 37.3 months of observation. Two aneurysms amenable to coiling were occluded without complication. Three of seven patients treated surgically had transient complications, though five were neurologically intact at follow-up. Basilar perforator artery aneurysms may be sources of hemorrhage in diffuse or perimesencephalic/prepontine SAH. While endovascular coiling is an excellent option if parent vessel anatomy allows for catheterization, many are unamenable to endovascular treatment.

Two days after, he had hypersomnia, vertical gaze palsy, double vision, left Horner's sign, and sensory disturbance of pain and temperature of right half body involving face. Brain MRI disclosed high intensity area in T2-weighted image and proton density in bilateral paramedian thalamo-mesencephalic region and right cerebellum (area of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery). Cerebral angiography showed 90% or more stenosis of the right vertebral artery, 50% stenosis of the left vertebral artery before the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), and 60% stenosis of distal portion of the basilar artery. Furthermore, stem portion of the posterior cerebral artery, and the right anterior cerebellar artery and the left vertebral artery after the PICA were absent or occluded. Right deafness was evaluated to be Jerger type II, namely disturbance of inner ear. Caloric tests showed no response, and right auditory brainstem response showed no waves. Main cause of this vertigo and right deafness was considered to be disturbance of inner ear due to ischemia of right labyrinthine artery, though this patient was not a typical case of the anterior cerebellar artery syndrome. Ischemic disturbances of inner ear have been reported only in patients with the anterior cerebellar artery syndrome, therefore this patient who had only acute ischemic disturbance of inner ear and did not have disturbance of caudo-lateral portion of the pons was considered to be very rare.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

In the attempt to clarify the problem we describe nocturnal sleep in a patient with hemiballism due to an ischemic damage of the subthalamic nucleus. The patient improved after one month haloperidol therapy and her unilateral (right) hyperkinesias disappeared. Electropolygraphic records (EEG, EOG, EMG of chin muscles, ECG) during spontaneous nocturnal sleep were obtained before therapy and after one month haloperidol treatment. The EEGs from bilateral fronto-central derivations were also recorded on magnetic tape to allow spectral analysis and automatic spindle detection by means of digital filtering. The pattern of spindle appearance rate for each stage 2 and 3 NonREM sleep in each night was investigated. We obtained: spindling index, that is the ratio between total spindle duration and sleep stage length, the mean number of spindle bursts/min, the average duration of sleep spindles, the mean amplitude, the mean time between spindles. Before therapy polygraphic records showed short total sleep time, a prolonged sleep latency, the lack of slow waves sleep and of REM sleep. After haloperidol treatment these parameters improved: total sleep time was longer, sleep latency shorter, slow waves sleep and REM sleep appeared. Before treatment spindle activity predominated in the left hemisphere - homolaterally to the subthalamic nucleus damage -, where the spindling index was higher, the mean number of spindle bursts/min larger, the mean time between spindles lower. After therapy, when hemisomatic hyperkinesias disappeared, spindle activity turned similar in the two hemispheres, since it decreased in the left hemisphere and it was unchanged in the right one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Bollettino della Societa italiana di biologia sperimentale,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Italy,ita

Hormonal and chemotherapies produced partial resolution of her neurologic symptoms and there were signs of reduction of the breast mass. Most reported PLE cases with hypersomnia have been associated with testicular cancer and anti-Ma antibodies.

Funduscopic abnormalities consistent with grade III and IV hypertensive retinopathy are rare in TTP, as are normal levels ofVon Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. Therefore, the diagnosis TTP was considered less likely and plasmapheresis was stopped. Hereafter, the laboratory values pointing towards haemolysis remained normal with adequate blood pressure control supporting the rejection of TTP as the cause of the symptoms.",{},,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,dut
590883,A method for provoking EEG abnormalities by administration of nialamide.,"Tanio, M; Shimoda, Y",Tanio,"Nialamide, a kind of monoamine oxydase inhibitor, was used for provoking centrencephalic EEG abnormalities and 6-14 Hz positive spikes. It was assumed that these EEG abnormalities have close relationship with dysfunctions of the brainstem which is rich in monoamines and monoamine oxydase. The nialamide provocation was carried out on 49 inpatients who had centrencephalic discharges in their EEG reports. These patients consisted of four cases of epilepsy, one case of anorexia nervosa, two cases of narcolepsy and 42 cases of diencephalosis. Another series of 22 patients suffering from other diseases, in whome EEG no centrencephalic EEG abnormallities were detected, were examined with nialamide. Out of the 49 patients, 35 cases (71.4+) showed increased EEG abnormalities following the administration of nialamide. It was noteworthy that this drug had provocative effect not only for EEG abnormalities, but also for the symptoms from which patients were suffering. In 26 out of 49 patients, both EEG abnormalities and clinical symptoms were provoked by nialamide. And the nialamide administration resulted in negative on all 22 patients who did not register centrencephalic EEG abnormalities. The mechanism and characteristics of this provocative procedure by the use of nialamide were evaluated.",{},,Folia psychiatrica et neurologica japonica,10.1111/j.1440-1819.1977.tb02642.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng
8695146,[Paramedian thalamo-mesencephalic infarct con triphasic waves].,"Egido, J A; Arroyo, R; Soriano, C; Espinar, J; Varela de Seijas, E",Egido,"Triphasic waves are usually associated with metabolic encephalopathies but have been reported in patients with other etiologies. The pathophysiology of this EEG pattern remains poorly understood, although they have been attributed to lesion in the connections between the thalamus and cortex. We report a case of top-of-the-basilar artery occlusion with selective paramedian thalamic-mesencephalic infarct in which triphasic waves were evident on the EEG during clinical hypersomnia. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triphasic waves with selective paramedian thalamomesencephalic infarct. We conclude that triphasic waves are a nonspecific manifestation of diencephalic dysfunction, probably of the paramedian thalamomesencephalic reticular system.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
