It is also interesting to point out how the clinical unit can be independent and unchangeable in medicine and, on the other hand, in the context of the reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES syndrome), the name can be changed. As such, cortex blindness arises after complete destruction of the visual cortex of both occipital lobes, often as a result of vascular circulatory disorders. PRES syndrome is characterized by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, where bilateral irregular hypodensive arteries are present in the occipital lobes that cause transient cortex blindness within the syndrome, which in its name carries the word reversible.

Herein, we present a case report of a 37-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and immunoglobulin A nephropathy who noted visual impairment after eating high-protein food. In addition to the case report, all previously documented cases of hepatic cortical blindness occurring across the globe published from inception until August 2019 were reviewed. The incidence of hepatic cortical blindness is low, and diagnoses are easily missed. The diagnosis of hepatic cortical blindness is dependent on symptoms, and patients may experience several attacks of vision loss. Most patients experience complete blindness, but vision loss recovers within 10 min to one month. Early detection and therapy for hepatic encephalopathy may improve patient outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of the medical sciences,10.1016/j.amjms.2022.04.034,,Case reports; Chronic liver failure; Cortical blindness; Hepatic encephalopathy; Review literature,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Differentiating optic pathway lesions can be challenging with classic imaging. Advanced imaging techniques as an investigational tool for posttraumatic hemianopia are discussed and their pitfalls highlighted through an illustrative case study. In a patient with posttraumatic hemianopia, MRI at 8 weeks and 2 years after trauma were analyzed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and morphometric analysis of the primary visual cortex (V1) were performed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed 2 years after trauma. DTI at 8 weeks showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the left optic tract together with a decrease in FA in the right optic tract and optic radiation. At 2 years, an isolated decrease of the left optic tract FA values was noticed together with signs of Wallerian degeneration on classic MR imaging. OCT showed thinning of the retina congruent with the visual field deficit. While DTI abnormalities were also present in the early scan, they were more diffuse and also encompassed functionally intact structures. Results of advanced imaging techniques need to be interpreted with caution and can vary according to the timing of imaging due to Wallerian degeneration.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-017-8661-2,,Diffusion tensor imaging; Hemianopia; Traumatic brain injury; Wallerian degeneration,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Herein, we present a case of delayed CVT diagnosis due to nonspecific neurological symptoms and nonprominent lesions in a patient with HH. A 65-year-old woman presented with a sudden onset headache accompanied by right HH that lasted for 1 day. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were initially performed due to suspicion of ischemic lesions or hemorrhage in the left postchiasmal visual pathway; however, no remarkable acute brain lesions were detected. Ophthalmological examinations revealed no notable findings, except for a definite field defect in the Humphrey visual field test. The headaches then waxed and waned but recurred 3 days after the initial symptom.A repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which revealed left sectoral gyral swelling and vascular enhancement in the occipital lobe. To further evaluate venous drainage, additional 3-dimensional cerebral computed tomography angiography and 4-vessel angiography were conducted, revealing a partial filling defect in the left transverse sinus and superior venous drainage impairment. These findings suggested the presence of venous thrombosis in the left transverse sinus. The patient was diagnosed with thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, which subsequently caused the right HH. Anticoagulation therapy with parenteral heparin was started as soon as the diagnosis of CVT was confirmed. Eventually, the patient was solely managed with oral warfarin administration. Following 3 days of treatment, her headache resolved, and a subsequent visual field testing conducted 2 weeks later revealed a definite improvement in the field defect. Despite its favorable prognosis, CVT can be challenging to diagnose. CVT should be considered as a differential diagnosis when diagnosing patients who present with headaches accompanied by HH without prominent brain lesions.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000036204,PMC10754574,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Three weeks earlier he was admitted to the hospital based on his respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse restricted bilateral foci in both parietal and occipital lobes in favor of acute infarction. Diffuse weighted imaging demonstrated restricted bilateral hyperintense signals in parietal and occipital region. Occipital cortex biopsy showed brain tissue with focal infiltration of foamy macrophages mixed with reactive astrocytes and no plasma cell infiltration.

This damage results in the characteristic triad of cortical blindness, visual anosognosia, and visual confabulation. This case describes an 80-year-old male with a background of renal transplant 7 years prior, admitted to hospital with worsening transplant function, and soon after developed sudden onset cortical blindness. On examination, the patient was found to be in denial of his blindness and showed signs of visual confabulation, both of which pointed toward a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. Radiological investigation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral ischemic stroke of the occipital lobes, which was later theorized to have occurred due to sirolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of sirolimus-induced TMA, bilateral ischemic occipital lobe stroke, and Anton's syndrome, within the same diagnosis. This case highlights that a diagnosis of bilateral occipital stroke with denial of blindness should suggest a diagnosis of Anton syndrome.

While fat embolization into systemic circulation is common, FES occurs in a meagre 0.05%-3% of patients having isolated long bone fractures. Though visual symptoms are commonly attributed to fat embolism retinopathy and is a later occurrence, it may not always be the case. Cortical blindness has been seldom reported in association with FES, and less so as a presenting complaint. Furthermore, no previous literature has described the same in context of an isolated tibia fracture. We report a 20-year-old gentleman with an isolated right tibia shaft fracture who developed sudden onset diminution of vision in both eyes less than 24 h following trauma with no other complaints. Lack of any remarkable ophthalmoscopic findings or other symptoms left us with a diagnostic conundrum. He later went on to develop altered mentation, hypoxia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures with subsequent MRI revealing multiple cerebral fat emboli also involving both occipital lobes. Supportive measures were instituted and his general condition as well as vision gradually improved following which he underwent plate fixation of the fracture under spinal anaesthesia. The perioperative period was uneventful and he was discharged following staple removal. At one month of follow-up, the patient had no residual visual field defects or neurological deficits. Though FES is rare among isolated tibia fractures, this clinical catastrophe may strike in any unsuspected setting thereby warranting a high index of suspicion to ensure early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Chinese journal of traumatology = Zhonghua chuang shang za zhi,10.1016/j.cjtee.2021.02.005,PMC8071712,Bone fractures; Cortical blindness; Fat embolism,Case Reports,China,eng

However, visual information obtained from the superior colliculus (SC) or direct thalamic afferents to higher visual cortices produces unconscious visual functions called blindsight. Alarming visual stimuli suggesting the approach of a predator are known to trigger escape behaviors via visual information mediated by the SC and amygdala in small animals, and salient and dynamic visual stimuli also produce some conscious visual experience even in patients with blindsight. Fresh cortical blindness sometimes recovers spontaneously in patients with fresh cerebral damages, and recovery can be accelerated by early rehabilitation. However, the mechanisms underlying recovery are not well-known. We analyzed a patient with cortical blindness caused by an old cerebral infarction. After repeated presentation of alarming visual stimuli, the ability to detect visual stimuli in the impaired visual field showed behavioral short-term improvement (STI) within a few minutes. Repeated behavioral STI induction was followed by behavioral long-term improvement (LTI) lasting more than several days. After behavioral LTI, the patient partially recovered the ability to read letters presented in the impaired visual field. The behavioral STI experiment, which can be performed within 10 min, may serve as a clinical screening test for anticipating recovery from cortical blindness.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.00069,PMC7020609,amygdala; blindsight; long-term potentiation; looming stimulus; short-term potentiation; superior colliculus; visual cortex,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Here, we present a case of choroid plexus arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which the capsulothalamic artery originated from distal plexal segment of the AChoA. Clinical presentation A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation involving the left inferior horn in screening MRI. Preceding stereotactic radiosurgery, transarterial target embolization was performed. In this procedure, 20% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was successfully injected from the lateral plexal branch of the AChoA. After embolization, right homonymous hemianopsia developed due to cerebral infarction on the left optic radiation. This infarction was considered to be within the territory of the capsulothalamic artery. Conclusion This anomalous capsulothalamic artery might be formed by hemodynamic compromise of the brain surrounding AVM in early gestation.

A descriptive case report is presented on a 17-year-old female diagnosed with acute pancreatitis who developed acute onset bilateral painless vision loss. A systematic literature review of cases with bilateral LGB lesions was conducted across three electronic databases (PubMed/PubMed Central/MEDLINE, Scopus, and ScienceDirect). The review was conducted in concordance with PRISMA guidelines and prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022362491). The reported 17-year-old female was found to have MRI findings consistent with bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the LGB and Purtscher-like retinopathy. A systematic literature review of bilateral LGB infarction yielded 23 records for analysis. 19/23 (82.6%) of reported cases occurred in women. Bilateral vision loss was noted in all cases. The average reported age was 27 years old with a range from 2-50. Gastrointestinal pathology (e.g., pancreatitis, gastroenteritis) was present in 8/23 (34.7%) of cases. 8/23 (34.7%) cases had neuroimaging or pathological evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. Most cases experienced partial recovery of visual loss; only one case (4.7%) had complete visual recovery. 9/23 (39.1%) cases were reported from the United States and 4/23 (17.3%) from India. Bilateral LGB lesion is a rare cause of vision loss, typically caused by systemic diseases and with female preponderance.

The reliance on a lexical-semantic strategy in spelling, semantic errors, and impaired phonology and syntax were all highly consistent with the general characteristics of right hemisphere language, as revealed by studies of split-brain patients and adults with dominant hemispherectomy. In addition, this pattern of writing closely resembled the syndrome of deep agraphia.

Selective angiography can be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, but in rare cases has been reported to cause sudden cortical blindness. We present a woman in her seventies for whom cerebral angiography revealed a dural arteriovenous fistula. Two hours after the angiography she experienced sudden bilateral blindness. A local cause of sudden visual loss was excluded by clinical examination, cerebral bleeding was excluded by CT scan, vascular spasms and occlusions were excluded by CT angiography and acute infarction over the bilateral parieto-occipital cortex was excluded by MRI. The CT scan did, however, show contrast enhancement in the visual cortex from the contrast given during the previously performed cerebral angiography. The patient's vision spontaneously recovered within six days after the angiography, with no residual neurological deficits in her subsequent clinical follow up. Surgery was later performed on her dural arteriovenous fistula, which successfully treated the pulsatile tinnitus. Transient cortical blindness is a rare but dramatic complication after cerebral angiography, thought to be caused by the transient neurotoxic effects of iodine-containing contrast agents.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute infarct in the left occipital lobe, left corpus callosum, and posteromedial aspect of the left thalamus. No cardiac source of the thrombus could be identified. After supportive treatment, the vision started improving after 3 days; recovery was 95% after 10 days. A feeding jejunostomy was performed urgently under local anesthesia, and 1 month of enteral nutrition was administered. One month after the event, the patient's vision returned to normal. Definitive surgery in the form of antrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction was performed 8 weeks later. Blindness secondary to central venous catheterization is very rare; possible mechanisms are venous thrombosis with paradoxical emboli, air emboli, or accidental arterial puncture. Clinicians must exercise caution while using PN. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose and treat unexpected complications.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,JPEN.

Neurologic examination, MRI, CSF and serologic analyses, and brain biopsy were performed. Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsied brain tissue were stained with histologic and immunohistochemical stains. Biopsy revealed an inflammatory subpial lesion containing lymphocytes and myelin-laden macrophages. Recurrent relapses with dissemination of MRI-typical white matter lesions characterized the subsequent course. Our findings highlight that cortical demyelination occurs on a background of inflammation and suggest that the noninflammatory character of chronic cortical demyelination may relate to long intervals between lesion formation and autopsy.

After treatment, imaging abnormalities are usually reversible. Eclampsia is the most frequent cause of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in pregnancy. We report a 24-year-old woman, who presented to our clinic 4 weeks after normal vaginal delivery with bilateral vision loss. Loss of vision was first noticed in the 20th week of pregnancy. Even after delivery, her vision did not improve. In the postpartum period, she started having periodic myoclonic jerks. Electroencephalography demonstrated periodic generalized discharges. A brain MRI performed in the 20th week of the antepartum period showed bilateral parieto-occipital cortical white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. A follow-up brain MRI, 5 months later, revealed marked reversal of white matter signal changes. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed raised anti-measles antibody titer, confirming the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. In conclusion, in a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) during the postpartum period, cortical vision loss and parieto-occipital white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities can simulate eclampsia.

Aggressive behavior was found in 3 patients (7.3%) among 41 patients with posterior cerebral artery stroke. One patient had right occipitotemporal and ventrolateral thalamic stroke. The second patient had left occipitotemporal and lateral thalamic stroke. The third patient had right isolated occipital stroke. In addition to a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, the patients, who were physically and emotionally balanced before the stroke, suddenly manifested an acute, unusual, aggressive behavior. The patients became agitated and aggressive when they were stimulated by the environment, and they responded to solicitation by their relatives or medical personnel by shouting obscenities and hitting and biting others. In all of the 3 cases, temporary physical restraint was required and neuroleptics were administered. This unusual behavioral pattern resolved within 2 weeks after stroke. Aggressive behavior is a rare presentation of acute posterior cerebral artery stroke, which may be difficult to diagnose in patients presenting with hemianopsia as the only concomitant neurological sign.

Brain computed tomography demonstrated recent hypodense infarctions at the bilateral occipital lobes. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. Because of his age and the thrombolytic therapy during the golden 3 hours after ischemic stroke, the patient received aspirin therapy rather than tissue plasminogen activator or warfarin. He gradually realized he was blind during the following week, but died of pneumonia 1 month later.

The typical presentation of a calcium channel blocker overdose is hypotension and decreased level of consciousness. We describe a case of a calcium channel blocker overdose that led to bilateral cortical blindness, a presentation that has not previously been reported. A 49-year-old white woman with known bilateral early optic atrophy presented to our hospital with hypotension and obtundation following a known ingestion of 150 mg of amlodipine. She was transferred to our intensive care unit where she was intubated, mechanically ventilated, and required maximal vasopressor support (norepinephrine 40 mcg/minute, epinephrine 40 mcg/minute, and vasopressin 2.4 units/hour) along with intravenously administered crystalloid boluses. Despite these measures, she continued to deteriorate with persistent hypotension and tachycardia, as well as anuria. Intralipid emulsion therapy was subsequently administered to which no initial response was observed. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse pulmonary edema; intravenous diuresis as well as continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Following the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, her oxygen requirements as well as urine output began to improve, and 3 days later she was liberated from mechanical ventilation. Following extubation, she complained of new onset visual impairment, specifically seeing only red-green colors, but no objects. An ophthalmologic examination revealed that this was due to bilateral optic atrophy from prolonged hypotension during the first 24 hours after the overdose.

We report a case of CRAO that was successfully treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and review the current literature. A 64-year-old right-handed man presented to the emergency department with acute left eye amaurosis. An ophthalmologic assessment revealed a left afferent pupillary defect, minimal visual acuity, macular edema with a cherry red spot, and multiple emboli in the inferotemporal arcade of the left eye. A neurologic examination was otherwise nonfocal; neuroimaging was normal. Acute CRAO was diagnosed, and rt-PA was administered intravenously 185 minutes after symptom onset. A repeat examination 4.5 hours after treatment found improved vision, reduced macular edema, and no emboli. An ophthalmologic evaluation 10 days later found a visual acuity of 20/200 in the left eye and bilateral arterial sclerosis without evidence of retinal emboli or macular edema. This case illustrates that intravenous rt-PA may be an effective therapeutic option for CRAO in select patients. Given the current literature and the recommended established safety window for thrombolytics in acute ischemic cerebral stroke, it is reasonable to administer intravenous treatment for CRAO within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. Nevertheless, it is critical that a prospective clinical trial confirm the efficacy, safety, and time window for treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2012.01.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Our patient had cortical blindness secondary to an ischemic occipital infarct following a hemotoxic snakebite - a seemingly distinct oxymoron. The physician should be mindful of the fact that a hemotoxic snakebite can deceptively bring in ischemic attacks as well. Toxic vasculitis, thrombotic angiopathies, widespread vasospasm and endothelial damage are believed to shoulder a part of the disease process that can bring about tissue ischemia. Hemotoxic snake envenomation can have devastating effects. Apart from dealing with the threat of coagulopathy, the physician must also be alert to the ironical ischemic aftermath that can equally bring in misery. Our patient had one such complication-bilateral cortical blindness resulting from bilateral occipital ischemic infarcts.

27851900,Residual perception of biological motion in cortical blindness.,"Ruffieux, Nicolas; Ramon, Meike; Lao, Junpeng; Colombo, Françoise; Stacchi, Lisa; Borruat, François-Xavier; Accolla, Ettore; Annoni, Jean-Marie; Caldara, Roberto",Ruffieux,"From birth, the human visual system shows a remarkable sensitivity for perceiving biological motion. This visual ability relies on a distributed network of brain regions and can be preserved even after damage of high-level ventral visual areas. However, it remains unknown whether this critical biological skill can withstand the loss of vision following bilateral striate damage. To address this question, we tested the categorization of human and animal biological motion in BC, a rare case of cortical blindness after anoxia-induced bilateral striate damage. The severity of his impairment, encompassing various aspects of vision (i.e., color, shape, face, and object recognition) and causing blind-like behavior, contrasts with a residual ability to process motion. We presented BC with static or dynamic point-light displays (PLDs) of human or animal walkers. These stimuli were presented either individually, or in pairs in two alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks. When confronted with individual PLDs, the patient was unable to categorize the stimuli, irrespective of whether they were static or dynamic. In the 2AFC task, BC exhibited appropriate eye movements towards diagnostic information, but performed at chance level with static PLDs, in stark contrast to his ability to efficiently categorize dynamic biological agents. This striking ability to categorize biological motion provided top-down information is important for at least two reasons. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of assessing patients' (visual) abilities across a range of task constraints, which can reveal potential residual abilities that may in turn represent a key feature for patient rehabilitation. Finally, our findings reinforce the view that the neural network processing biological motion can efficiently operate despite severely impaired low-level vision, positing our natural predisposition for processing dynamicity in biological agents as a robust feature of human vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.11.009,,Biological motion; Cortical blindness; Eye tracking; Residual visual ability; Striate damage; Task dependency,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed high signal intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and normal signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images of the posterior lobe, which mostly disappeared with the improvement of clinical symptoms. Subsequent diagnosis revealed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Recognition of PRES as the correct diagnosis led to the appropriate management strategy and the recovery of normal vision. Differentiation from acute cerebral ischemia is important in order to prevent permanent vision loss due to delay in initiating prompt and vigorous treatment of exacerbating factors, such as intermittent hypertension.

Further detailed analysis of the radiologic findings and clinical history led to the correct diagnosis. Visual acuity and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Recognition of the correct diagnosis of RPLES led to the institution of antihypertensive therapy and recovery of normal vision. The diagnosis of RPLES should be considered in all patients with acute cerebral visual loss, especially in the setting of recent surgery, blood transfusion, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant use, hypertension, eclampsia, or seizures. Prompt diagnosis requires close collaboration with a radiologist and an emergent MRI study, which ideally should include diffusion-weighted imaging with calculation of an apparent diffusion coefficient map.

Involvement of the medial sphenoid wing includes anterior clinoid, cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure meningiomas. Due to the proximity of these tumors to the optic nerve, typically progressive unilateral vision loss, over several months to years, is the classic clinical presentation. We report three cases of acute monocular vision loss, two transient and one permanent, ipsilateral to a sphenoid meningioma. Ophthalmological involvement with sphenoid meningiomas is most often chronic, due to interruption of axoplasmic flow and demyelination of the optic nerve by local compression. However, vascular involvement with ischemia of the optic nerve or transient low blood flow secondary to compression of the carotid branches vascularizing these structures is another possible mechanism. In our series, two patients had amaurosis fugax, and one patient had sudden, persistent visual loss in relation to acute anterior ischemic optic neuropathy on the side of the meningioma. The mean age of patients with acute visual manifestations was 62 years. These ischemic and non-compressive visual symptoms, ipsilateral to sphenoid meningiomas, are difficult to interpret. Whether these temporary visual disturbances of vascular origin should be considered an early sign of future severe or permanent visual impairment when no optic nerve compression is observed is not certain. The place of these acute visual disturbances in the therapeutic decision, particularly surgical, remains to be defined. Larger multicentric prospective studies are needed to better understand the role of local circulatory factors attributable to meningioma in the occurrence of these acute visual signs.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,10.1016/j.jfo.2018.12.006,,Amaurose transitoire; Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; Meningioma; Méningiome; Neuropathie optique ischémique antérieure aiguë; Sphenoid; Sphénoïde; Transient visual loss,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of an old infarct involving the optic radiations.

Several studies in patients with damage to their primary visual cortices have shown that they may be able to guess the emotional expression on a face despite their cortical blindness. This non-conscious processing, called affective blindsight, may arise through an intact subcortical visual route that leads from the superior colliculus to the pulvinar, and thence to the amygdala. This pathway is thought to process the crude visual information conveyed by the low spatial frequencies of the stimuli. In order to investigate whether this is the case, we studied a patient (TN) with bilateral cortical blindness and affective blindsight. An fMRI paradigm was performed in which fearful and neutral expressions were presented using faces that were either unfiltered, or filtered to remove high or low spatial frequencies. Unfiltered fearful faces produced right amygdala activation although the patient was unaware of the presence of the stimuli. More importantly, the low spatial frequency components of fearful faces continued to produce right amygdala activity while the high spatial frequency components did not. Our findings thus confirm that the visual information present in the low spatial frequencies is sufficient to produce affective blindsight, further suggesting that its existence could rely on the subcortical colliculo-pulvino-amygdalar pathway.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.009,,Affective blindsight; Amygdala; Facial expressions; Fear emotion; Hemianopia; Spatial frequency,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of improvement in hemianopsia after surgery for metastatic brain tumors involving or adjacent to the optic radiation (OR). The study included 49 patients with brain metastasis in the parietal and occipital lobes in the present study. Preoperative and postoperative neurological assessments included visual field, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Karnofsky performance scale. Of 49 patients, 33 (67.3%) presented with preoperative homonymous hemianopsia. Of these 33 patients, the visual field was improved postoperatively in 17 patients (51.5%). In all patients regardless of preoperative hemianopsia, postoperative visual fields did not deteriorate. Tractography demonstrated that the OR was split by the tumor (n = 6) and fanning of fibers expanded along the lateral side of the tumor (n = 11). All tumors were removed via surgical access toward the medial side of the tumor. Gross total resection was achieved in most tumors in the group with visual improvement (n = 16/17; 94.1%). Improvement in the visual field was attributed to tumor location in the subcortical white matter, removal rate of the tumor, and higher postoperative Karnofsky performance scale score. The OR tended to deviate to the lateral side of the tumor in the parieto-occipital junction. The postoperative visual field improved even in cases of an occipital tumor.

He could differentiate bright and dark but was unable to count fingers, and there was bradydiadochokinesia. Ophthalmologic investigations exclusively revealed severe visual field defects bilaterally. Visually-evoked-potentials were absent bilaterally. MRI of the cerebrum revealed bilateral occipital, non-enhancing T2-hyperintensities, which extended towards the temporal lobe. On diffusion weighted imaging hyperintense areas were intermingled with hypointense areas. H-MR-spectroscopy disclosed an increased lactate peak, but reduced creatine, cholin, and N-acetyl-aspartate peaks. CSF-protein was slightly elevated, oligoclonal bands were positive, and PCR positive for the JC-virus. T-helper cells were markedly reduced. Cardiologic investigations revealed right bundle-branch-block, left ventricular wall thickening and LVHT in the left ventricular apex and the lateral wall. During follow-up visual acuity transiently improved but lastly deteriorated again despite a highly-active anti-retroviral therapy.

The patient with the right posterior lesion could not recognize handwriting, was prosopagnosic and topographagnosic, but had no difficulty in reading, lipreading, or in recognizing stylized drawings. The apparent double dissociation of function demonstrates the presence of two different visual processing mechanisms which are very probably peculiar to the visual system of the left hemisphere in the one case and to that of the right hemisphere in the other.

In both patients ECG and blood pressure were normal. Case 1 had a slight increase of protein level without cells on CSF examination and presented with a paralytic ileus. Case 2 developed an inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (IADHS) syndrome. In both cases, noncontrast CT scans showed bilateral, symmetrical low density areas within the temporooccipital regions. Postcontrast CT images stressed major cortical and subcortical enhancement predominantly over the gray matter. In Case 2 the lesions also affected the right parietal lobe. Magnetic resonance scans 2-3 weeks after the onset of neurological symptoms demonstrated low intensity signal lesions on T1-weighted images and bright signal on T2-weighted images. In Case 1 the visual deficit failed to regress and in Case 2 the patient died 2 months later because of the natural evolution of her lymphoma. The clinical and radiological data suggested that a vascular ischemic process was responsible for the cerebral lesions in these two patients. As Vinca alkaloids and not methotrexate have been implicated as a cause of cortical blindness, and as our two patients presented signs of overdose of vindesine (paralytic ileus and IADHS), we suggest that the neurological and radiological abnormalities in our patients may have been due to neurotoxicity of vindesine.",{},,Journal of computer assisted tomography,10.1097/00004728-199003000-00019,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although the hemispatial neglect slowly improved, the homonymous hemianopia persisted.

Glucose metabolism in the right occipital cortex was 61.1% of that in the homologous region on the left side, 62.8% in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and 93.8% in the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. The low glucose metabolism in the right visual cortex explains the persistent left hemianopia, and that in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and the right temporal-parietal-occipital junction may be responsible for the left hemispatial neglect.

Residual visual abilities following a hemispheric lesion leading to homonymous hemianopia encompass a variety of visual-perceptual and visuo-motor functions. Attention blindsight produces the more salient subjective experiences, especially for motion (Riddoch phenomenon). Action blindsight illustrates visuo-motor abilities despite the patients' feeling that they produce random movements. Perception blindsight seems to be the weakest residual function observed in blindsight, e.g. for wavelength sensitivity. Discriminating motion produced by isoluminant colours does not give rise to blindsight for motion but the outcome of the reciprocal test is not known. Here we tested whether moving stimuli could give rise to colour discrimination in a patient with homonymous hemianopia. It was found that even though the patient exhibited nearly perfect performances for motion direction discrimination his colour discrimination for the same moving stimulus remained at chance level.

The clinical course, possible etiologies and management of visual loss in three patients are described. The first patient developed Terson's syndrome (vitreal hemorrhage associated with raised intracranial pressure secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage). Following aneursymal clipping, her postoperative management was conservative and there was no improvement in visual acuity. The second patient underwent surgical clipping of internal carotid aneursysms and sustained visual loss subsequent to surgical dissection and temporary clipping around the optic nerve and anterior choroidal artery. The vessel subsequently thrombosed. Potential contributing factors to visual loss in this case included intraoperative hypotension and anemia. This patient received anti-platelet medications, and experienced subsequent improvement in visual acuity to 6/9. A third patient underwent a right orbito-frontal keyhole craniotomy with the cranial flap retracted across the orbit. Elevated intraocular pressure secondary to external orbital compression may have compromised retinal and choroidal perfusion. This patient also developed vasospasm of both anterior cerebral arteries which resolved partially with papaverine therapy. Hypertension-hypervolemia therapy was instituted, with subsequent partial recovery of visual acuity in her right eye.

Furthermore, linear T1W-hyperintense lesions were found in the cerebral cortex of the same areas and showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Perfusion-weighted images revealed hyperperfusion in the affected regions.

We experienced 6 cases of unilateral blindness immediately after surgery for 3 recent years. These patients were classified into Hunt-Hess grade I to II except for one patient with III. All patients complained of visual loss with varying degree of lid oedema and ophthalmoplegia ipsilateral to the site of surgery. Angiographic examination of these patients revealed that the aneurysm was located at the internal carotid artery bifurcation in one case and the middle cerebral artery bifurcation in five cases. All of them were relatively far from the optic nerve. The aneurysm was clipped easily with minimal brain retraction via standard pterional craniotomy since the brain was slack in all cases. In all cases, injuring the optic nerve during surgery was remote. All patients showed evidence of retinal ischaemia on fundoscopy with or without fluorescein angiography. The pathophysiology of this ischaemic event is unknown. In our patients, we could exclude possible aetiological factors such as abnormal systemic and ocular conditions, causing ischaemia in intra-orbital structures, increased intracranial pressure, intra-operative hypotension, carotid atherosclerosis, and ocular vasospasm etc. Accordingly we speculate that the complications seen in our cases were most likely related to intra-orbital ischaemia initiated by a collapse of the arterial and venous channels in the orbit and/or to direct or indirect contusion on the intra-orbital structures. These situations could be produced by inadvertent pressure placed on the eyeball with a bulky retracted frontal skin flap. Visual acuity in these patients ranged from no light perception to the ability to see objects and detect colour. Their conditions were irreversible. The degree of visual recovery seems to be dependent on the duration and severity of retinal ischaemia by orbital compression. Unfortunately there is no satisfactory treatment.

The fusiform gyrus probably has a critical role in colour integration, visuo-spatial processing, facial recognition and corresponding visual imagery. Involvement of the occipitotemporal projection system deep to the lingual gyri probably explained visual memory dysfunction, by a visuo-limbic disconnection.

Moreover, eight months after the onset, FDG-PET scan was performed. Goldmann VF perimetry was also performed at the same times of PET examinations. Decrease of cerebral glucose metabolism in the right anterior striate cortex was observed at three months after onset, while FMZ binding in the same area did not decrease in the patient. At eight months after onset, we observed recovery of VF and improvement of cerebral glucose metabolism in the anterior striate cortex.

Patients mostly suffer from hemianopia. Different treatment approaches in patients with hemianopia are being debated with respect to their effectiveness. For more severely disabled patients with cortical blindness or residual rudimentary vision (RRV) no systematic therapeutic approaches have been reported. In a case study the positive effects of a recently developed repetitive photic stimulation therapy in a patient with RRV after a bioccipital ischemic infarction are presented. The application of this new therapy over several months, supported by treatment with amphetamines led to a statistically significant improvement of different visual functions and a reoccurrence of visual abilities important in daily life.

Generalized, tonic-clonic seizures started to occur during behavioral training to get the animal to enter a carrying cage for future psychological experiments. Blindness was suspected because of a lack of approaching behavior toward foods such as fruits. Although the monkey was extensively treated with anticonvulsants, the clinical signs did not improve. An increased serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level and bilateral occipital brain atrophy were detected. Histopathologically, a severe degree of cerebromalacia was detected bilaterally in the occipital lobe, and necrosis and gliosis were seen mainly in the temporal lobe. Focal inflammation was found in the meninges. No other changes were observed in other nervous tissues or organs, and no signs of a parasitic or viral infection were found in the systemic organs. Spontaneously occurring lesions in the central nervous system have been rarely reported in laboratory monkeys. In the present case, the cause of cerebromalacia could not be confirmed, but the relationship between symptoms such as abnormal vision and the presence of brain lesions was distinct.

However, there was also some indication that these patients were not generally agnosic for object orientation but were able to gain access to at least some information about objects' canonical upright. We studied a new case (KB) with spared knowledge of object identity and impaired perception of object orientation using a forced choice paradigm to contrast directly the patient's ability to perceive objects' canonical upright vs non-upright orientations. We presented 2D-pictures of objects with unambiguous canonical upright orientations in four different orientations (0 degrees, -90 degrees, +90 degrees, 180 degrees ). KB showed no impairment in identifying letters, objects, animals, or faces irrespective of their given orientation. Also, her knowledge of upright orientation of stimuli was perfectly preserved. In sharp contrast, KB was not able to judge the orientation when the stimuli were presented in a non-upright orientation. The findings give further support for a distributed view-based representation of objects in which neurons become tuned to the features present in certain views of an object. Since we see more upright than inverted animals and familiar objects, the statistics of these images leads to a larger number of neurons tuned for objects in an upright orientation. We suppose that probably for this reason KB's knowledge of upright orientation was found to be more robust against neuronal damage than knowledge of other orientations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(00)00043-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Additional testing was performed by means of MR imaging of the brain and CSF analysis. Follow-up was performed for 12 months. Vision loss was acute and severe, its onset bilateral and simultaneous. The patient recovered visual acuity of 1.0 within 7 weeks. Color vision was abnormal in both eyes but gradually improved to normal. Visual fields were characterized by incongruous binasal and bitemporal defects, but they reduced progressively. Cerebral MR imaging confirmed the presence of symmetrical lesions confined exclusively within both lateral geniculate bodies. These lesions were best seen on T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images as high-signal-intensity areas suggestive of hemorrhagic ischemia. CSF analysis was normal and aseptic. Blood tests and cultures excluded any microbial infection. We conclude that shock may induce a bilateral isolated ischemia of the lateral geniculate bodies, resulting in incongruous binasal and bitemporal visual field defects and severe visual loss. MR imaging is the optimal imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis and for follow-up.",{},,AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,,PMC7976391,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Computerized perimetry indicated a left visual field defect only although MRI and 18FDG-PET scans showed abnormalities in both occipital lobes. The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.",{},,NeuroImage,10.1006/nimg.1998.0390,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Previous studies suggest that obstacle avoidance relies on mechanisms in the dorsal visual stream in the posterior parietal cortex. One fundamental question that remains unanswered is where the visual inputs to these dorsal-stream mechanisms are coming from. Here, we provide compelling evidence that these mechanisms can operate in ""real-time"" without direct input from primary visual cortex (V1). In our first experiment, we used a reaching task to demonstrate that an individual with a dense left visual field hemianopia after damage to V1 remained strikingly sensitive to the position of unseen static obstacles placed in his blind field. Importantly, in a second experiment, we showed that his sensitivity to the same obstacles in his blind field was abolished when a short 2-s delay (without vision) was introduced before reach onset. These findings have far-reaching implications, not only for our understanding of the time constraints under which different visual pathways operate, but also in relation to how these seemingly ""primitive"" subcortical visual pathways can control complex everyday behavior without recourse to conscious vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.0905549106,PMC2747232,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Gerstmann's syndrome is a combination of disorientation for left and right, finger agnosia, and profound agraphia, alexia, and acalculia. It is due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus, situated at the confluence of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report on a patient who suffered from severe underdiagnosed eclampsia and who developed bilateral extensive medial temporal, parietal, and calcarine ischemic infarctions during an eclamptic fit. In addition, ischemia destroyed the left angular gyrus. The combination of these lesions led to Gerstmann's syndrome with additional cortical agnosia and cortical diplopia. For the first few months following the ischemic insult, the patient had been cortically blind. Thereafter, the patient slowly regained a visual acuity of 0.1 in both eyes. She then experienced monocular and binocular diplopia. Her ocular motility was normal; there was no phoria or tropia. Monocular and binocular diplopia slowly became less severe over the following year. Now, 2 years after the incident, the patient has a visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes and no double vision. However, the handicapping symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome, which make leading a normal life impossible, have persisted--the patient still cannot cope alone, mainly due to the severe disorientation for left and right. The picture of cortical agnosia, cortical diplopia, and Gerstmann's syndrome is a very rare combination. Visual recovery and rehabilitation in cortical blindness are severely affected and made difficult by the symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome. In our case the reason for such a dramatic clinical picture was eclampsia, whose prodomes had not been diagnosed in time.",{},,German journal of ophthalmology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Nevertheless, under some experimental conditions, subjects demonstrate a capacity to make visual discriminations in the blind hemifield (blindsight), even though they have no phenomenal experience of seeing. This capacity must, therefore, be mediated by parallel projections to other brain areas. It is also the case that some subjects have conscious residual vision in response to fast moving stimuli or sudden changes in light flux level presented to the blind hemifield, characterized by a contentless kind of awareness, a feeling of something happening, albeit not normal seeing. The relationship between these two modes of discrimination has never been studied systematically. We examine, in the same experiment, both the unconscious discrimination and the conscious visual awareness of moving stimuli in a subject with unilateral damage to V1. The results demonstrate an excellent capacity to discriminate motion direction and orientation in the absence of acknowledged perceptual awareness. Discrimination of the stimulus parameters for acknowledged awareness apparently follows a different functional relationship with respect to stimulus speed, displacement, and stimulus contrast. As performance in the two modes can be quantitatively matched, the findings suggest that it should be possible to image brain activity and to identify the active areas involved in the same subject performing the same discrimination task, both with and without conscious awareness, and hence to determine whether any structures contribute uniquely to conscious perception.",{},,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.92.13.6122,PMC41654,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

7583104,The McCollough effect reveals orientation discrimination in a case of cortical blindness.,"Humphrey, G K; Goodale, M A; Corbetta, M; Aglioti, S",Humphrey,"The McCollough effect is a colour after-effect that is contingent on the orientation of the patterns used to induce it. To produce the effect, two differently oriented grating patterns--such as a red-and-black vertical grating and a green-and-black horizontal grating--are viewed alternatively for a few minutes. After this period of adaptation, if the black-and-white test gratings are viewed in the same orientation as the adaptation patterns, the white sections of the vertical grating will appear pale green and the white sections of the horizontal grating will appear pink. The McCollough effect indicates that colour- and orientation-coding mechanisms interact at some point during visual processing; but the question remains as to whether this interaction occurs at an early or later stage in the cortical visual pathways. In an attempt to answer this question, we studied a patient who had suffered extensive damage to extrastriate visual areas of the brain, which had left him able to see colour but little else. Neuropsychological and perceptual tests demonstrated that the patient, P.B., has a profound impairment in form perception and is even unable to discriminate between 90 degrees differences in the orientation of grating stimuli. He is also unable to use orientation information to control his reaching or grasping. Nevertheless, P.B. can name and discriminate different colours reliably, including those used to induce the McCollough effect. After adaptation with red-and-green gratings, P.B. appropriately reported the orientation-contingent aftereffect colours, even though he continued to be unable to discriminate the orientations of the test patterns. These results indicate that at some level in P.B.'s visual system orientation is being coded, but it is at a level that he is unable to use in making orientation judgements or in visuomotor control. Given the massive insult to the extrastriate cortex in P.B., it is likely that the anatomical locus of the mechanisms underlying the McCollough effect is within primary visual cortex or even earlier in the visual pathway.",{},,Current biology : CB,10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00107-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
9848860,Iatrogenic vertebrobasilar insufficiency after surgery of the subclavian or brachial artery: review of three cases.,"Amar, A P; Levy, M L; Giannotta, S L",Amar,"Vertebrobasilar insufficiency resulting from disease of the subclavian artery is well recognized. Usually, this occurs as the ""subclavian steal"" syndrome in the context of chronic subclavian stenosis and is consequently well tolerated because of collateralization. Acute disruption of the hemodynamics of the aortic arch vessels, however, can produce disastrous sequelae. We present three cases of iatrogenic vertebrobasilar insufficiency sustained as complications of surgery of the left subclavian artery or its distal continuation. The cases were chosen from a review of approximately 400 emergency neurosurgery consultations requested at the Los Angeles County Hospital between November 1995 and February 1996. The first patient underwent repair of a traumatic brachial artery occlusion and awoke postoperatively with bilateral cortical blindness, right hemiparesis, and multiple cranial nerve deficits that were most likely caused by acute subclavian steal. The second underwent removal of a subclavian embolus and developed bilateral cerebellar infarction leading to persistent coma, possibly from inadvertent embolization of the vertebral artery during surgery. The third underwent resection and bypass grafting of a subclavian aneurysm. Good backflow was reported when the vertebral artery was disarticulated from the subclavian artery, and this vessel was not reimplanted into the graft. The patient suffered massive cerebellar infarction leading rapidly to brain death. There are myriad ways in which the inherent redundancy of the vertebrobasilar system may be jeopardized, and when this protective mechanism fails, the results can be disastrous. Flow through the vertebral arteries may be compromised by thrombosis, embolization, dissection, inappropriate ligation, excessive head rotation, hypotension, vasospasm, or acute subclavian steal. These examples illustrate the importance of understanding the complex physiology of posterior fossa circulation as the basis of pre-, intra-, and postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery of the subclavian artery.",{},,Neurosurgery,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient was first given an orally presented forced-choice test devised to assess orthogonal combinations of knowledge type and knowledge category. In the production of this test it was found that normals took longer to respond to Visual questions than to Functional/Associative questions; therefore, sets of questions were compiled that were matched for both accuracy and latency. There were two main findings concerning N.B.'s semantic memory. First, with careful matching of difficulty level, the patient showed selective preservation of Functional/Associative knowledge of Animate objects compared with Visual knowledge of Animate objects and also compared with Functional/Associative knowledge of Inanimate objects. Second, there was a qualitative difference in patterns of knowledge retrieval for Visual compared with Functional/Associative knowledge. Retrieval of Visual knowledge, both Animate and Inanimate, was inconsistent and, in a word-pair recall test, a high degree of connection of a Visual property to an object did not promote paired-associate learning. In contrast, retrieval of Functional/Associative knowledge (both Animate and Inanimate) was consistent and paired-associate learning was influenced by connection strength.

Magnetic resonance image examination was performed, and it showed acute cerebral infarction at right posterior cerebral artery territory including right thalamus (ventral posterior lateral nucleus). Generally, AHS is caused by left mediofrontal and callosal lesion (frontal type AHS), or by callosal with bilateral frontal or without frontal lesion (callosal type AHS). However, some cases were reported that they presented AHS after damage of the basal ganglia, right thalamus, right occipital or inferior parietal lobe. Some authors described this phenomenon as ""sensory"" or ""posterior"" type AHS. In such cases, included our case, we speculate that sensory impairment causes AHS.

Neurological examinations were normal, except for left homonymous hemianopsia. Goldmann visual field testing revealed a left congruent incomplete homonymous hemianopsia with macular splitting. Brain MRI, with a T2-weighted image, demonstrated a lesion of high intensity in the right lateral geniculate body (LGB), as well as the posterior part of the caudate nucleus, posterolateral thalamus, and dorsolateral thalamus. MRA revealed severe stenosis at the second segment of right posterior cerebral artery (PCA). SPECT revealed significantly decreased blood perfusion in the striate cortex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an isolated, congruent, incomplete, homonymous hemianopsia due to lateral posterior choroidal artery (LPChA) region infarction. The LPChA possibly supplied the LGB through the PCA system. A horizontal, homonymous sectoranopia is typically the hallmark of an LPChA region infarction. However, a homonymous hemianopsia may also occur when the entire LGB has been affected. In the case of homonymous hemianopsia, LGB damage due to LPChA region infarction should be considered, in addition to lesions of the visual pathway, such as the optic tract, optic radiations, and occipital cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2009.07.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Ten patients with no significant atherosclerotic narrowing or ulceration of the external carotid artery have remained free of symptoms of cerebral ischemia for 6 to 40 months. In twelve patients who developed delayed recurrent cerebral or retinal ischemia ipsilateral to their internal carotid artery occlusion, there were found obstructive and/or ulcerative plaques involving the common and/or external carotid arteries. Thromboendarterectomy in 11 of these patients gave complete relief of ischemic symptoms during the 4 to 36 months of postoperative follow up.

However, it is now recognized that the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) may occur more frequently in SS as opposed to multiple sclerosis. Characteristic NMOSD features can include severe attacks of optic neuritis, myelitis which is frequently longitudinally-extensive (spanning at least three vertebral segments on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and an association with anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies. In addition, whereas NMOSD was initially thought to spare the brain, it is now recognized that brain lesions occur in a majority of NMOSD patients. Therefore, it is important for the multi-disciplinary team of physicians who care for SS patients to understand this widening spectrum of NMOSD as encompassing brain lesions. In this case-report we describe clinical features, radiographic findings, and treatment of a SS NMOSD patient presenting with severely decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, and encephalopathy. The SS NMOSD patient presented with rapid, bilateral onset of severely decreased visual acuity and was therefore suspected as having bilateral optic neuritis. However, the patient lacked stigmata of optic neuritis, instead had visual hallucinations and encephalopathy suggestive of cortical blindness, and was noted to have occipital lobe lesions on brain MRI. Other radiographic findings included simultaneous enhancement of brainstem and periventricular lesions. The patient was initially treated with methylprednisolone with no change in her neurological deficits. She was then treated with plasma exchange therapy. The patient had resolution of decreased visual acuity, visual hallucinations, encephalopathy, and contrast-enhancing brain lesions in response to plasma exchange therapy. We provide the first example of severely decreased visual acuity in a NMOSD patient due to cortical blindness and not bilateral optic neuritis. This finding expands the spectrum of central nervous system syndromes and brain lesions which may occur in NMOSD. The synchronous enhancement of a brainstem lesion (known to occur in NMOSD) with occipital lobe lesions also suggests that our patient's occipital lobe findings were due to NMOSD. All of our patient's findings had an excellent clinical and radiographic response to plasma exchange therapy.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000007454,PMC5571989,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We provide a detailed case report of a patient with the Riddoch phenomenon, MC. MC has extensive bilateral lesions to occipitotemporal cortex that include most early visual cortex and complete blindness in visual field perimetry testing with static targets. Nevertheless, she shows a remarkably robust preserved ability to perceive motion, enabling her to navigate through cluttered environments and perform actions like catching moving balls. Comparisons of MC's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to a probabilistic atlas based on controls reveals that MC's lesions encompass the posterior, lateral, and ventral early visual cortex bilaterally (V1, V2, V3A/B, LO1/2, TO1/2, hV4 and VO1 in both hemispheres) as well as more extensive damage to right parietal (inferior parietal lobule) and left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VO1, PHC1/2). She shows some sparing of anterior occipital cortex, which may account for her ability to see moving targets beyond ~15 degrees eccentricity during perimetry. Most strikingly, functional and structural MRI revealed robust and reliable spared functionality of the middle temporal motion complex (MT+) bilaterally. Moreover, consistent with her preserved ability to discriminate motion direction in psychophysical testing, MC also shows direction-selective adaptation in MT+. A variety of tests did not enable us to discern whether input to MT+ was driven by her spared anterior occipital cortex or subcortical inputs. Nevertheless, MC shows rich motion perception despite profoundly impaired static and form vision, combined with clear preservation of activation in MT+, thus supporting the role of MT+ in the Riddoch phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.05.008,PMC6991136,Blindsight; FMRI; Middle temporal area (MT+); Motion perception; Riddoch phenomenon; Vision,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng
7611084,Transient global amnesia and cortical blindness after vertebral angiography: further evidence for the role of arterial spasm.,"Jackson, A; Stewart, G; Wood, A; Gillespie, J E",Jackson,"We describe a series of six patients who experienced severe retrograde amnesia (five cases) or cortical blindness (one case) during selective vertebral angiography. All angiograms were obtained with the same nonionic contrast medium. Analysis of the contrast batch demonstrated no abnormalities, but investigation of the angiographic suite revealed a faulty contrast warming cabinet resulting in injection of contrast material above body temperature. The warming cabinet was withdrawn, and the complication has not recurred. We believe that these symptoms reflect ischemia caused by vertebral arterial spasm.",{},,AJNR.

12757903,Spatial and temporal processing in a subject with cortical blindness following occipital surgery.,"Trevethan, Ceri T; Sahraie, Arash",Trevethan,"Blindsight subjects are typically better at discriminating rapid, transient visual events than those with gradual on/off-sets. Surprisingly, the detailed investigation of temporal characteristics of mechanisms mediating blindsight is only reported in one subject (GY). It is of interest to establish whether these characteristics are similar to those in other cases of blindsight. Here, we report on a systematic study of spatio-temporal properties of mechanisms mediating blindsight in a subject VN. VN has a lower right quadranopia following surgical removal of the left occipital cortex above the calcarine sulcus, therefore, there are no remaining islands of intact visual cortex within this area. Similar to GY, the blindsight mechanisms in VN have narrowly tuned band-pass temporal characteristics with a peak sensitivity at 20Hz and above chance performance at temporal frequencies >/=10 and </=33Hz. The spatial channel in VN has low-pass characteristics with an upper cut-off <3.5c/ degrees. There is extensive spatial summation in the blindfield whereas no temporal summation was found in the time range tested (50-1600ms). In agreement with our previous reports, pupillary responses can predict the existence of residual vision within the field defect and show similar spatial characteristics to those obtained psychophysically. The spatio-temporal characteristics of blindsight in VN reported here are similar to those reported in subjects with ischaemic lesions, suggesting that such visual capacities need not necessarily be attributed to spared areas of visual cortex.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00049-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
15112196,Transient visual loss may anticipate occipital infarction from hemodialysis.,"Wells, Michael; Foroozan, Rod",Wells,"The aim of this study was to report on a patient who had occipital infarction from intradialytic hypotension and review the literature on hemodialysis and visual loss. Neuro-ophthalmologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were conducted. A 61-year-old woman had acute onset of a right homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defect during dialysis after several episodes of transient visual loss associated with symptomatic intradialytic hypotension. MRI showed acute infarction in the left occipital lobe. Visual loss is an uncommon complication of hemodialysis. The mechanism usually is related to hypotension and is usually from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Although cortical blindness secondary to stroke has been reported as a complication after hemodialysis, we were unable to find another report of visual loss secondary to stroke attributed to intradialytic hypotension with preceding episodes of transient visual loss. Transient visual loss may be a risk factor for stroke during hemodialysis.",{},,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,10.1053/j.ajkd.2004.01.017,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
2713142,"On the different roles of the cerebral hemispheres in mental imagery: the ""o'Clock Test"" in two clinical cases.","Grossi, D; Modafferi, A; Pelosi, L; Trojano, L",Grossi,"This paper develops the hypothesis of different roles of the two hemispheres in imaginal processes. A test designated the ""o'Clock Test"" is proposed, which contains closely confrontable perceptual and imaginal tasks. It enables examination of the abilities both to generate mental images and to explore them in their right and left halves (R + L Condition). This test was used to examine two patients, one severely affected by hemi-inattention resulting from a right posterior lesion, and the other with a selective deficit of imagery due to a left occipital lesion. The former demonstrated left neglect in both perceptive and imaginal capacities, while the latter was able to perform correctly only the perceptive tasks. These results suggest that the right hemisphere has functions of organization and spatial exploration at both perceptive and imaginal levels, and that the left hemisphere's role is to generate mental images.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(89)90072-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Four days before admission he had suffered 2 short episodes of aching jaw, dizziness, and profuse sweating. Myocardial infarction was confirmed by serial ECGs and cardiac enzymes. His cortical blindness was thought to be secondary to an embolus from a myocardial mural thrombus. A review of the literature revealed 5 previous patients with cortical blindness and associated myocardial infarction. In 2 of these, blindness followed within days of the myocardial infarct, but in none was it the presenting feature of a myocardial infarct.",{},,Postgraduate medical journal,10.1136/pgmj.56.656.423,PMC2425717,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We explored if this hypothesis may be applicable to a patient with late-onset blindness. A 72-year-old male with bilateral blindness experienced a sudden inability to navigate after suffering a stroke. Multiple lesions scattered bilaterally throughout the parietal-occipital lobes were found. Deficits in the neural correlates underlying egocentric or allocentric strategies may result in topographical disorientation, even if one appears to be the predominant orientation strategy utilized.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2010.06.009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng
