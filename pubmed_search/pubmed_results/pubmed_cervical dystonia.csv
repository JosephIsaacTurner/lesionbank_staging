29426369,Cervico-shoulder dystonia following lateral medullary infarction: a case report and review of the literature.,"Ogawa, Takashi; Shojima, Yuri; Kuroki, Takuma; Eguchi, Hiroto; Hattori, Nobutaka; Miwa, Hideto",Ogawa,"Secondary cervical dystonia is induced by organic brain lesions involving the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and brain stem. It is extremely rare to see cervical dystonia induced by a medullary lesion. We report a case of an 86-year-old Japanese woman who developed cervical dystonia following lateral medullary infarction. She developed sudden-onset left upper and lower extremity weakness, right-side numbness, and dysarthria. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute ischemic lesion involving the left lateral and dorsal medullae. A few days after her stroke, she complained of a taut sensation in her left neck and body, and cervico-shoulder dystonia toward the contralateral side subsequently appeared. Within a few weeks, it disappeared spontaneously, but her hemiplegia remained residual. To date, to the best of our knowledge, there has been only one reported case of cervical dystonia associated with a single medullary lesion. It is interesting to note the similarities in the clinical characteristics of the previously reported case and our patient: the involvement of the dorsal and caudal parts of the medullary and associated ipsilateral hemiplegia. The present case may support the speculation that the lateral and caudal regions of the medulla may be the anatomical sites responsible for inducing cervical dystonia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-018-1561-y,PMC5807857,Case report; Cervical dystonia; Lateral medullary infarction; Literature review; Opalski’s syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Patients were examined, treated with botulinum toxin as necessary, and were followed up to 5 years.

12518301,Secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the central nervous system.,"LeDoux, Mark S; Brady, Kimberly A",LeDoux,"We tested the hypothesis that structural lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with cervical dystonia more commonly involve the cerebellum and its primary afferent pathways than basal ganglia structures. Cervical dystonia is the most common focal dystonia, the majority of cases are idiopathic, and only a small percentage of patients have a family history of dystonia or other movement disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms operative in solely or predominantly appendicular dystonias such as writer's cramp and Oppenheim's dystonia, respectively, may not be directly applicable to axial dystonias. The localization of structural lesions of the CNS associated with secondary cervical dystonia may provide some insight into the neural structures potentially involved in primary cervical dystonia. The National Library of Medicine Gateway (from 1960) and a clinical database maintained by the senior author (from 1999) were searched for cases of secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the CNS. Search terms included one or more of the following: dystonia, torticollis, cervical, secondary, and symptomatic. Lesion localization and type, patient age, patient gender, head position, occurrence of sensory tricks, and associated neurological findings were tabulated for each case. Structural lesions associated with cervical dystonia were most commonly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum. The remaining cases were equally divided between the cervical spinal cord and basal ganglia. Although inconsistent, head rotation tended to be contralateral to lesion localization. Additional neurological abnormalities were present in the majority of patients with secondary cervical dystonia. The relative paucity of basal ganglia pathology and concentration of lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord in patients with secondary cervical dystonia suggests that dysfunction of cerebellar afferent pathways may be important to the pathophysiology of primary cervical dystonia.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.10301,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review",United States,eng

The onset of dystonia paralleled the appearance of other focal neurologic signs. All patients had extraaxial tumors located in the cerebellopontine angle that were removed via suboccipital approaches. The tumors were identified as schwannomas arising from the glossopharyngeal nerve and from the vagus/accessory nerves; and a meningioma. Postoperatively, the cervical dystonia improved markedly during a period of 8 years in one patient, and it remitted completely within 1 year in another patient. In the third patient, cervical dystonia persisted. The combination of the clinical findings and the temporal relationship of their appearance suggest a causal association between the posterior fossa tumors and cervical dystonia in three cases.

We report the first patient with secondary CD after stereotactic radiosurgery for thalamic glioma. Possible network abnormalities relevant to manifestation of CD were discussed. A 27-year-old woman complaining of headache and left motor weakness was found to have a thalamic tumor on the right side. The lesion was totally removed using transventricular approach. Histopathologically, tumor samples manifested features of anaplastic astrocytoma. She underwent stereotactic radiosurgery in addition to the conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Afterward, she returned to her usual life without any neurological deficits. Sixteen months postoperatively, the patient developed forced head tilting to the left side combined with chin lift. On the TWSTRS, she registered 15 for torticollis severity. The abnormal head posturing was alleviated by the sensory trick of touching her face with her right hand. Irregular-shaped lesion involving the thalamus, lenticular nuclei, midbrain, pons, and cerebellum was presented on magnetic resonance images. Steroid therapy effectively diminished the lesion size, and her abnormal head posturing was gradually ameliorated (TWSTRS severity scale = 3). The clinical-neuroradiological course of the present case strongly suggested that the lesion detected long after the surgery was due to radiation necrosis. The present study may provide a critical information in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of CD that may involve substantial interactions between olivocerebellar and basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits.",{},,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2006.11.034,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

11383945,Meige syndrome secondary to basal ganglia injury: a potential cause of acute respiratory distress.,"Kirton, C A; Riopelle, R J",Kirton,"Meige syndrome is a movement disorder that includes blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonias. Its etiology may be idiopathic (primary) or it may arise secondary to focal brain injury. Acute respiratory distress as a feature of such dystonias occurs infrequently. A review of the literature on Meige syndrome and the relationship between dystonias and respiratory compromise is presented. A 60-year-old woman suffered a cerebral anoxic event secondary to manual strangulation. She developed progressive blepharospasm combined with oromandibular and cervical dystonias. Neuroimaging demonstrated bilateral damage localized to the globus pallidus. Years later, she presented to the emergency department in intermittent respiratory distress associated with facial and cervical muscle spasms. Increasing frequency and severity of the disorder was noted over years. The acute onset of respiratory involvement required intubation and eventual tracheotomy. A partial therapeutic benefit of tetrabenazine was demonstrated. This case highlights two interesting aspects of Meige's syndrome: (1) Focal bilateral basal ganglia lesions appear to be responsible for this patient's movement disorder which is consistent with relative overactivity of the direct pathway from striatum to globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticularis; (2) Respiratory involvement in a primarily craniofacial dystonia to the point of acute airway compromise.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

A 64-year-old man noticed a sudden onset of mild weakness in his left hand and also difficulty in preventing his head from dropping onto his chest without weakness of the neck extensor muscles. Magnetic resonance images showed acute ischemic changes at the right putamen and caudate nucleus. Surface electromyography (EMG) performed 3 days after the stroke showed that both trapeziuses were hypertonic at rest, whereas the activity of the sternocleidomastoids was gradually increased on passive head lifting, indicating dystonia of the neck muscles. His dropped head fully improved by 9 days after the stroke. Re-examination by surface EMG 30 days after the stroke showed no hypertonic activity in the neck muscles. DHS is characterized by an abnormal ante-fixed posture of the neck, usually observed in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and Parkinson disease. This is the first case of reversible DHS after acute ischemic stroke, and the accumulation of similar cases will be important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of DHS and stroke-associated movement disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.05.017,,Kubisagari; basal ganglia; cervical dystonia; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
26346787,Sleep bruxism possibly triggered by multiple sclerosis attacks and treated successfully with botulinum toxin: Report of three cases.,"Sevim, Serhan; Kaleağası, Hakan; Fidancı, Halit",Sevim,"Sleep bruxism refers to a nocturnal parafunctional activity including the clenching, grinding or gnashing of teeth. While most of the nocturnal bruxism cases seen in the general population are apparently idiopathic, it has been reported to be associated with a range of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease, cranio-cervical dystonia and post-anoxic brain damage, but not multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe three cases of MS patients who have had moderate to severe complaints of bruxism in the two weeks following their relevant MS attacks. None of the three patients had a diagnosis of bruxism prior to her attack. The diagnosis was confirmed in one out of three by a polysomnography. One patient did not have any complaints related to bruxism previous to her attack, whereas two had mild and infrequent complaints. The symptoms of the relevant attacks were left hemihypesthesia in all and hemiparesis in two. None of the patients had spasticity that could result in severe teeth clenching. All three patients presented with morning headaches and jaw pain or tightness and were treated successfully with botulinum toxin (Btx) injections applied to their masseter and temporalis muscles. The cause of bruxism is controversial but lesions of the cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cotrical loops are thought to be most likely. However, acute or chronic lesions in those pathways were not demonstrated in the 3 patients. It is feasible that they had normal appearing white matter interruptions in their cortico-basalganglia-thalamocortical loops along with their relevant attack.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2015.06.006,,Attack; Botulinum toxin; Bruxism; Multiple sclerosis; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

21387699,[A case of a syndrome resembling PSP after aortic arch replacement under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest].,"Sakiyama, Yusuke; Michizono, Kumiko; Tomari, Shinya; Watanabe, Osamu; Nakahara, Keiichi; Takashima, Hiroshi",Sakiyama,"A 57-year-old man presented with acute signs and symptoms mimicking PSP (bradykinesia, supranuclear ocular palsy, dysphagia, neck dystonia, and apraxic gait) on the day after a graft replacement surgery, which was performed for aortic arch aneurysm under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (rectal temperature, 18 degrees C). Dysphagia improved temporarily, but relapsed after a few months. Symptoms did not change during 2 years of antiparkinsonian drug administration. Brain images obtained before the surgery revealed slight atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and frontal lobes, but the patient was asymptomatic. No findings of cerebral vascular disease and hypoxic encephalopathy were observed on brain images after the surgery. These clinical features resembling PSP might have been caused by deep hypothermia and the patient's predisposition for PSP. This is the first case report in Japan of a syndrome resembling PSP that occurred after aortic arch replacement under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.51.38,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
8937201,[A patient with parkinsonism presenting hyperintensity in the globus pallidus on T1-weighted MR images: the correlation with manganese poisoning].,"Katsuragi, T; Takahashi, T; Shibuya, K; Nagatomo, H; Iwabuchi, K",Katsuragi,"We report a 55-year-old woman who developed symptoms resembling parkinsonism. Her psychiatric symptoms in the early stage, cervical dystonia and tremor increasing on movement were consistent with manganese poisoning. Manganese levels were elevated to 1.5 micrograms/l in the serum (normal; 0.3-1.1 micrograms/l) and to 1.4 micrograms/l in the urine (normal; less than 1.2 micrograms/l). Intravenous infusion of calcium disodium editate (CaEDTA; chelating agent) was followed by the marked excretion of manganese (27.3 micrograms/l) in the urine. These findings support manganese poisoning. Manganese poisoning is a disease which results from chronic exposure to manganese, but the source of manganese exposure remained obscure in this patient. T1-weighted MRI of the brain showed symmetric high signal intensity in the globus pallidus without any abnormality on T2-weighted images. There is a report that manganese induced brain lesions in Macaca fascicularis as revealed by MRI and the fascicularis developed signs of unsteady gait and hypoactivity. The patient responded to treatment with CaEDTA and the second MRI demonstrated regression of abnormal signal intensity. This may be due to enhanced manganese excretion. To our knowledge, this is the first case of probable manganese-induced human parkinsonism whom changes in MRI were noted after treatment with CaEDTA.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
12590379,[Movement disorders in adult-onset measles encephalitis].,"Cubo, E",Cubo,"There are three different neurological complications of measles infections in the brain: acute postinfectious encephalitis, acute progressive infectious encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The diagnosis of measles encephalitis (ME) is established when supported by the clinical picture, mainly of juvenile onset, and confirmed by the presence of cerebrospinal measles antibodies. Although ME is clinically characterized by progressive behavioral and mental deterioration associated with myoclonus, prior reports have suggested that adult-onset may have atypical features. We describe a 28 year-old immunocompetent man, admitted into the hospital due to a rapid motor and cognitive decline after an episode of fever and gastroenteritis. His neurological examination was significant for cognitive impairment, cervical dystonia, spontaneous and action induced myoclonus, choreiform movements, parkinsonism and ataxic gait. He was diagnosed of acute postinfectious ME based on the presence of elevated intrathecal synthesis of measles antibodies in his CSF, and a lymphocytic infiltrate of perivascular distribution without viral inclusions, with PCR negative for measles from brain biopsy. The patient continued to deteriorate to an akinetic mutism state, dying a few weeks later. Adult-onset ME is an entity rarely seen in the Western world. Although myoclonus is the most common movement disorder related to juvenile-onset ME, ataxia and other dyskinesias such as chorea, dystonia, and parkinsonism, can result from this infection when presenting in adult life.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
