It is the result of occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). It is caused by atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or emboli from another source. A 60-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with vertigo, vomiting, slurred speech, hiccups, and left-side weakness associated with paresthesia for 1 day. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled hypertension and a smoking habit. The neurological examination revealed ataxia, and left hemiparesis associated with paresthesia. A cranial nerve examination revealed slight right-sided ptosis, mouth deviation, and loss of sensory sensation on the right side of the face. Brain MRI showed right medullary infarct consistent with LMS. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and vertebral artery color Doppler were normal. He was admitted to the neurology ward and was treated with low molecular weight heparin 60 mg subcutaneously, aspirin 300 mg, neuroprotective agents, and antihypertensive treatment. After 6 days of medical treatment, his condition has improved massively (dysarthria and dysphagia disappeared). He was discharged for physical rehabilitation. LMS (Wallenberg syndrome) is one of the brainstem stroke syndromes caused by occlusion of PICA. Vertigo, vomiting, dysphagia, dysarthria, ipsilateral ataxia, Horner's syndrome, and contralateral hemiparesis define this syndrome. Brain MRI is necessary for diagnosis alongside clinical syndrome. LMS is a rare form of brainstem stroke and carries a favorable prognosis if early hospitalization and treatment is applied. Brain MRI, including diffusion sequence, is the most useful diagnostic tool for detecting LMS.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1097/MS9.0000000000000260,PMC10010825,PICA; brainstem stroke; lateral medullary syndrome,Case Reports,England,eng

Cerebral mass-like presentation of neurosarcoidosis rarely reported in the literature. We presented a woman with neurosarcoidosis who had a cerebral mass-like lesion which completely disappeared after medical treatment. A 37-year-old woman with history of pulmonary sarcoidosis referred to the emergency service of our hospital with a one-month history of progressive dizziness, nausea and seeing flashing lights. At neurologic examination, numbness and weakness on the left side of the body, deviation of uvula toward the right side was seen. Cranial MRI demonstrated a 2.5x2 cm in size mass lesion which hypointense on T1 WI, heterogeneous hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR sequence with peripheral vasogenic edema and heterogeneous, irregular contrast enhancement simulating brain tumor. Also, leptomeningeal and nodular contrast enhancement was seen on brainstem, cerebellar vermis, perimesencephalic cistern and left frontal, bilateral parietooccipital sulcus. In laboratory tests; The level of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was 53 IU/mL (N:8-52 IU/mL) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ACE was 23 IU/mL (N:0-2.6 IU/mL).

Symptoms are commonly subacute in onset and involve migraine type of headache, seizures, focal neurologic deficits (2). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are usually unilateral and posterior predominant cortical-subcortical hyperintensity, swelling and prominent gyriform (cortical and leptomeningeal) gadolinium enhancement in the areas of the brain that underwent irradiation with or without diffusion restriction (1). There is no standard treatment protocol for SMART syndrome. Antiepileptics and corticosteroids are commonly used drugs. A 65 years old woman was diagnosed with breast cancer with brain metastases and treated with more than 50 Gy brain radiotherapy. The patient presented with acute right-sided weakness and numbness, episodic myoclonic jerking of the right arm and leg, and gait instability five months later. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain with gadolinium revealed left parietooccipital cortical diffusion restriction and accompanying dilatation of the left posterior cerebral artery as new findings. Computed tomography (CT) perfusion revealed increased perfusion in the affected area. The patient was diagnosed with SMART syndrome. The patient was treated with dexamethasone (16 mg/day) and anticonvulsant therapy. Myoclonic seizures had almost completely remitted. However, her cognitive impairment persisted, then the patient was arrested because of aspiration a month later. Besides confirming SMART syndrome, diagnostic investigations are also important to exclude other etiologies. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, post-ictal changes, meningoencephalitis, and cerebrovascular diseases are radiological differential diagnoses considered (3). Proper and early diagnosis of SMART syndrome is significant in preventing unnecessary aggressive approaches and appropriate treatment to avoid lesions of sequela.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Acta neurologica Belgica,10.1007/s13760-022-01965-6,,Brain radiation; Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Among them, cerebrovascular diseases, including moyamoya disease, need to be excluded since they share common clinical features and radiographic findings with multiple sclerosis. A 44-year-old woman experienced transient numbness of her right sided face and arm and was referred to our unit due to small brain lesions in magnetic resonance imaging, with a possible diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for plantar reflexes and jerky deep tendon reflexes. Brain magnetic resonance angiography revealed findings typically seen in moyamoya disease, confirmed with digital subtraction angiography. Antiplatelet therapy started, but few days later, she developed suddenly global aphasia and right hemiparesis (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/NIHSS 6). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarct in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. At her discharge, she was significantly improved (NIHSS 3). Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is often challenging. In particular, in young patients with transient neurological symptoms and atypical white matter lesions in magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrovascular disorders such as moyamoya disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

33515796,Cavernous Sinus Meningioma Resection Through Orbitozygomatic Craniotomy.,"Najera, Edinson; Muhsen, Baha'eddin A; Borghei-Razavi, Hamid; Adada, Badih",Najera,"Meningiomas of the cavernous sinus (CS) present a neurosurgical challenge. The anatomic complexity of the area can create a potential for injury to neurovascular structures. This has traditionally limited total tumor removal. A thorough understanding of the cavernous sinus surgical anatomy can help overcome this problem. Patients with CS meningiomas generally present with cranial nerve deficits (III-VI), proptosis, and visual disturbances. Management of CS tumors is controversial and includes observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, and surgical resection. We present the case of a 43-year-old right-handed male who presented with right facial numbness. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed a right cavernous sinus tumor. He underwent stereotactic radiosurgery at an outside hospital. His facial numbness gradually improved. Four years later he had recurrence of the right facial numbness in the V3 distribution associated with right eyelid ptosis and diplopia. On neurologic examination he had decreased sensation to light touch in the 3 branches of the trigeminal nerve. He had a right eyelid ptosis and a 6-VI cranial nerve palsy. A new magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed radiologic progression of the tumor. An orbitozygomatic craniotomy was performed and gross total tumor resection was achieved through lateral wall of the cavernous sinus working mainly between V2 and V3. The facial numbness he had preoperatively gradually improved, and his extraocular movements and eyelid ptosis recovered completely. Histopathology showed a clear cell grade 2 meningioma. The patient received adjuvant radiosurgery. At 3-year follow-up, the patient was free of disease recurrence. CS surgery for meningioma is feasible with low morbidity and can provide benefits in improving preexisting cranial nerve dysfunction (Video 1).<sup>1-4</sup> Complete resection of the CS meningiomas is possible in most cases. CS tumors remain a surgical challenge, but accurate knowledge of surgical neuroanatomy and surgical approaches facilitates their safe and effective treatment.

We report a rare case of ESP concomitant with carotid web as the cause of recurrent stroke. A 59-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with recurrent numbness and weakness in the right upper extremity. The patient had a long-standing history of lightheadedness and left-side amaurosis with neck flexion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed scattered infarctions in the left frontal and parietal lobes. After multi-modal imaging we determined that embolic cerebral infarction was most likely to be secondary to the carotid web. Moreover, ESP causes dynamic hypoperfusion during neck flexion. We believe that this is a good reason for dealing with both pathologies during the same surgery. Thus, carotid endarterectomy and styloid process resection were performed at the same time. The previous symptoms during the head position change did not recur, and the right hand weakness was resolved. ESP and carotid web are unusual mechanisms of ischemic stroke. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to prevent subsequent severe strokes.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2023.107088,,Carotid web; Cerebral infarction; Elongated styloid process; Ischemic stroke mechanism,Case Reports,United States,eng

Appropriate history and neurodiagnostic testing are essential to encompass the extended spectrum of clinical and radiological differentials of ABS. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with slurred speech, dizziness, right-sided facial droop, and numbness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed non-enhancing hyperintensities in the right lateral pons and brachium pontis, eventually extending to the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, pons, left>right cerebellar hemisphere, right thalamocapsular region, and midbrain region. Lumbar puncture revealed 3 cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands. Initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis led to high-dose intravenous steroid treatment. The patient continued to deteriorate, leading to multiple emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Additional history revealing previously diagnosed, treatment-naive HIV prompted a repeat lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC polyomavirus (JCV) was positive, leading to the diagnosis of clinically isolated brainstem PML. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure, which ultimately led to her death. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need for considering isolated brainstem PML, as a diagnostic possibility, in patients presenting with acute-subacute brainstem symptoms and compatible neuroimaging findings. Clinicians need to be aware of varying PML presentations with brainstem or diencephalic variants, as well as monofocal lesions. The prognosis for PML has improved somewhat, secondary to immune reconstitution by highly active antiretroviral therapy, risk stratification in drug-induced PML, and other emerging treatments, such as pembrolizumab.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.935019,PMC8762610,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

On magnetic resonance venography, the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses were occluded. The second patient, a 39-year-old woman, presented with acute onset of diplopia, numbness of the tongue, vertigo, and right-sided weakness following a gestational age stillbirth. MRI revealed lesions in the right half of midbrain and pons and in the superior part of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Digital subtraction angiography showed right transverse and sigmoid sinus occlusion. The authors suggest that one should investigate the possibility of venous infarction in the presence of posterior fossa lesions that are often hemorrhagic and are not within any arterial territory distribution but respect a known venous drainage pattern. Recognition of the observed clinical and neuroimaging features can lead to earlier diagnosis and, potentially, more effective management.",{},,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,10.1111/j.1552-6569.2001.tb00073.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

However, little attention has focused on the propensity of hemorrhage in this entity, and the etiology of cyst occurrence in ALLC remains uncertain. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of relevant articles addressing the relationship between hemorrhage and cyst development in ALCC. A 30-year-old woman presented with headache, diminishing eyesight, and face numbness over the course of 16 months. Repeat radiologic examination showed the formation of a new cyst and the enlargement of former cyst after hemorrhage. She was diagnosed formerly with ALCC with the triad of leukoencephalopathy, calcifications, and cyst in imaging. Staging gross total resections of cyst were achieved with neurologic improvement postoperatively. Histologic examination revealed angiomatous vessels, Rosenthal fiber formation, microcalcification, and deposits of hemosiderin, and ALCC was confirmed pathologically. After analyzing the clinical data about the hemorrhage and cysts in our case and all 15 reported ALCC cases in the literature, we conclude that intermittent hemorrhage and cysts development are 2 outstanding features for ALCC and that hemorrhage is a probable mechanism for the formation and expansion of cyst.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.09.049,,Adult; Hemorrhage; Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng

Brain abscesses caused by L. monocytogenes are extremely rare. In this study, we describe a case of an older male who with a brain abscess caused by Listeria infection. We report a case of a 59-year-old male who was once diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction. The diagnose was changed after needle biopsy of the abscess and culture of L. monocytogenes. The patient was first empirically used the broad-spectrum antibiotic meropenem for 12 days (2 g Q8 h) until culture results were available, and then switched to oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg/12 h for further 2 weeks. The symptoms of slurred speech, numbness and impaired muscle strength of the right leg improved. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination were performed 2 weeks after operation showed smaller abscess and reduced perifocal edema. The patient was continued oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 8 weeks. The remaining right arm dysfunction recovered. After six months, the patient had returned to normal daily activities and only exhibited weakness of the right fingers. Brain abscess caused by L. monocytogenes should be considered in patients who have risk factors for listeriosis. Pathogen infection, including with Listeria monocytogenes, should be taken into account when patients with impaired immune function exhibit hemiplegia and aphasia. Listeria infection should also be considered in immunocompetent patients.

This is relevant when considering the use of anticoagulation in cases of CVT regarding whether or not associated hemorrhage is present and whether the hemorrhage is currently expanding. A 16-year-old right-handed female G2P2 (gravidity 2 [2 pregnancies] and parity 2 [2 live births after at least 24 weeks) presented 8 days postpartum with complaints of slurred speech, right facial droop, and right upper extremity numbness that had progressed over the course of 4 hours before presentation. On imaging the patient had a CVT with associated hemorrhage progressing in size at serial 6-hour stability computed tomography scans for 24 hours post arrival. At 24 hours the patient went into disseminated intravascular coagulation and demonstrated signs of herniation. The patient underwent an emergency hemicraniectomy along with a right frontal external ventricular drain for intracranial pressure monitoring. Most recently, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 and was ultimately discovered to have antiphospholipid syndrome. This case of CVT demonstrates the need for critically reading guidelines, as in this case the time to anticoagulation treatment was shorter than in cases included in guideline construction and repeated computed tomography examination demonstrated expansion suggesting it is unsuitable for immediate anticoagulation. Certain cases may fall outside of the study parameters on which guidelines are constructed, and clinicians should be aware of these exceptions.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.03.220,,Cortical venous thrombosis; Decompressive hemicraniectomy; Intracranial hemorrhage; Ischemic stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

Although radiosurgery is less invasive, surgical resection provides more rapid resolution of symptoms. We reviewed a short series of patients who underwent an anterior transpetrosal approach for surgical resection of meningiomas causing trigeminal neuralgia. A retrospective review of 5 consecutive patients with meningiomas causing trigeminal neuralgia of the senior author was included. Preoperative parameters (size, proximity to critical neurovascular structures, presence of brainstem compression), intraoperative parameters (Simpson grade of resection, loss of brainstem evoked potentials, surgical approach), and outcomes (symptom resolution, extent of resection, follow-up) were recorded. Patient median age was 67 years (range, 60-73 years). All patients had symptoms concerning trigeminal neuralgia with 2 having associated areas of facial numbness. The anterior transpetrosal approach was used to achieve complete resection (Simpson grade I). Postresection, the trigeminal nerve and brainstem were clearly visible to evaluate neurovascular structures and ensure decompression. No postoperative complications were reported, and all patients experienced sustained symptomatic relief 1 month postsurgery. With the advent of radiosurgery for skull base meningiomas, surgical resection is not always considered; however, such meningiomas causing trigeminal neuralgia can be resected safely using the anterior transpetrosal approach allowing rapid resolution of symptoms.

The cortical hand syndrome is a rare stroke presentation that results from infarction of the precentral gyrus leading to variable neurologic deficits mimicking peripheral nerve injuries, with no prior reports in the perioperative setting. To raise awareness of this complication among anesthesiologists, we present a case of cortical hand syndrome in a surgical patient initially suspected to have a peripheral neuropathy. A 68-yr-old male with multiple stroke risk factors underwent a nephroureterectomy under general anesthesia and thoracic epidural analgesia for urothelial carcinoma. The patient noted right-hand numbness and weakness to digits 3-5 immediately after surgery and notified his bedside nurse the following day. His symptoms were initially presumed to be a peripheral neuropathy secondary to surgical positioning. Computed tomography of the head the following day revealed an acute cortical infarct in the precentral gyrus consistent with cortical hand stroke syndrome. Subsequent neurologic consultation revealed additional subtle right-sided weakness. Further workup revealed moderate (60-80%) stenosis of the left carotid artery and he underwent a successful carotid endarterectomy one week later. His symptoms had mostly resolved six weeks later. Cortical hand stroke syndrome is a rare presentation of perioperative stroke that may be misdiagnosed as a peripheral neuropathy. Our case presentation highlights that perioperative stroke should be considered for patients presenting with neurologic deficits of the hand, particularly those with deficits in multiple peripheral nerve territories and stroke risk factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,10.1007/s12630-023-02587-z,,cortical hand stroke; peripheral neuropathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Several theories have been established, and some earlier reports hypothesized the relation to laterality. However, some cases could not be fully explained by the laterality theory (1). To clarify the gustatory pathway, we reported a case with bilateral hypogeusia after right thalamic infarction. This 55-year-old, right-handed man suffered from sudden decreased sensitivity of taste. He was unable to differentiate sweetness and saltiness at bilateral anterior parts of tongue. Additionally, there was numbness at the upper palate and the lips. Neurological examination revealed decreased taste sense at both sides of his anterior tongue and decreased pin-prick sensation of the left part of his lips. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute ischemic stroke at the right ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM). Thus, single antiplatelet therapy was administered. Two weeks later, the symptoms improved significantly and completely recovered without sequelae. The exact gustatory pathway in humans remains uncertain nowadays. First, there were few reports about dysgeusia, which might be related to clinical neglect of taste deficits. Second, our knowledge of the human gustatory pathway depends solely on sporadic cases of taste-involved brain lesions. We reported a case of bilateral hypogeusia after right thalamic infarction. This finding indicates that, although there might be laterality of gustatory fibers to the left hemisphere, anatomical variations may exist in the human gustatory system. More research is needed to elucidate the understanding of the gustatory pathway in humans.",{},,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,,,bilateral hypogeusia; central gustatory pathway; laterality thalamic infarction.,Case Reports; Journal Article,China (Republic : 1949- ),eng

All patients had lateral or dorsolateral medullary infarctions that were ipsilateral to their perioral paresthesia. The contributory origin is considered a diagonal lesion involving the par oralis fibers within the descending trigeminal sensory tract and acral portion of the lateral spinothalamic tract at the lateral portion of medulla oblongata. Despite of a restricted sensory disturbance at initial, progressive neurological disability terminated to Wallenberg's syndrome ensued in three patients and disabling deficits persisted in two of them.

Despite their clinical effectiveness, neurological adverse events have been reported, and literature data suggest a potential role of anti-TNF-<i>α</i> in the induction of demyelination. <i>Case Presentation</i>. In this series, we present three cases of demyelination after the use of anti-TNF-<i>α</i> agents. The first case involved a 21-year-old man with HLA-B27 negative peripheral spondylarthritis who had been taking adalimumab for 2 years. He developed headache, urinary incontinence, and bilateral lower extremity numbness that progressed to the middle of the trunk for 2 days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple hyperintense enhancement lesions in the left paramedian anterior pons consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). The second case included a 17-year-old woman who was on 2 years of adalimumab treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis and chronic anterior uveitis and developed new-onset dizziness and tremors. The clinical examination showed signs of cerebellar dysfunction. MRI findings were consistent with multiple sclerosis. The third case was a 34-year-old male who was on 5 years of infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis when he developed left hand numbness and weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and MRI findings were consistent with demyelination. Discontinuation of tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF-<i>α</i>) resulted in resolution of the symptoms with no recurrence in the first case, but there was evidence of recurrence in the other 2 cases, where one was managed with rituximab and the second one improved with pulse steroid therapy. Despite the small number of patients, our series adds to the growing body of evidence supporting a causal link between anti-TNF-<i>α</i> agents and demyelination. Thus, we can conclude that on suspicion of any neurological side effects, early discontinuation of the TNF-<i>α</i> blockers and requesting urgent MRI scan to confirm the diagnosis is of utmost importance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2022/3784938,PMC8920694,,Case Reports,United States,eng

A 34-year-old patient, gravida 5 para 1-0-3-1, presented to labor and delivery triage at 21 weeks, 0 days' gestation with the concern of sudden-onset right-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness and weakness. Intracranial imaging via magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small left midbrain venous cavernoma in the periaqueductal region of the posterior lateral cerebral peduncle area with evidence of edema and focal hemorrhage. During a 3-day hospital admission, the patient's deficits slowly improved, and she was discharged home. She subsequently delivered vaginally without incident. Six days postpartum, the patient presented with symptoms that were similar to her initial presentation. She was correctly diagnosed with migraine with aura after the appropriate neuroimaging studies did not show an acute stroke. This case demonstrates the similarities between the perilous diagnosis of stroke and the more routine diagnosis of migraine.

We retrospectively reviewed the data of eight patients with post-traumatic GBS between July 2011 and December 2018 at the Second Xiangya Hospital, China, and analyzed the triggers, clinical manifestation, examination results, treatment, prognosis, and potential mechanism related to post-traumatic GBS. The included patients had GBS preceded by no risk factors other than trauma. Their age ranged from 15 to 60 years (the median age was 52 years), and six patients were males. The potential traumatic triggers included spinal surgery (<i>n</i> = 2), high-intensity exercise (<i>n</i> = 2), traumatic brain injury (<i>n</i> = 1), excessive fatigue (<i>n</i> = 1), ischemic stroke (<i>n</i> = 1), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<i>n</i> = 1). The major manifestation was symmetrical limb weakness and/or numbness in all patients. The diagnosis of GBS was based on the results of electromyography, albumino-cytological dissociation, or antiganglioside antibody in cerebrospinal fluid, and other diseases were excluded. Immunotherapy improved symptoms, except in one patient who died. Trauma is a probable risk factor for GBS that is very easily overlooked, thereby leading to misdiagnosis in clinical practice. We emphasize a new concept of post-traumatic GBS to promote doctors' awareness when they meet people with weakness and sensory deficits after trauma, which benefit early diagnosis, timely treatment, and reduced mortality rate of GBS.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in surgery,10.3389/fsurg.2022.903334,PMC9455818,Guillain-Barré syndrome; case report; demyelinating disease; post-surgery; post-trauma,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Complication rates are typically low and include paresthesia, hematoma, epidural abscess, meningitis, arachnoiditis and inadvertent subdural or subarachnoid injection. Persistent paraplegia after lumbar transforaminal block has been recently reported. Undetected intra-arterial injection has been implicated as a possible cause.

Intra-arterial injection of corticosteroid is implicated with focus on particulate size of compound versus blood vessel dimension. Light microscopic data are presented to confirm the potential for embolic vascular occlusion. Case report; light microscopic data. A patient underwent selective transforaminal block on the right at the C5-C6 level. There was C5-C6 disc herniation documented by magnetic resonance imaging and C6 radiculopathy by electromyographic studies. Patient follow-up from medical office records. Needle placement at the C5-C6 foramen on the right was confirmed by biplanar fluoroscopy and injection of contrast medium. Frequent heme-negative aspirations were documented. In this patient, quadriparesis ensued shortly after injection of corticosteroid solution. The patient was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit and ultimately underwent brainstem decompressive surgery when focal neurologic deficits became evident. Working diagnosis was massive cerebellar infarct. Light microscopic data are presented to illustrate particulate size in corticosteroid solutions and potential for embolic microvascular occlusion. Corticosteroid suspensions (and to a lesser extent solutions) contain large particles capable of occluding metarterioles and arterioles.

The pathophysiological mechanism underlying UHS remains unclear. We report a 25-year-old woman, who described numbness in her left upper extremity. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterior upper cervical cord lesion. There was no cortical lesion that could explain the clinical findings. We measured (1) short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) by obtaining motor evoked potentials as an indicator of sensorimotor integration and (2) somatosensorial temporal discrimination threshold (STDT) to display central somatosensory pathway function. In the right cerebral hemisphere, we found an excessive increase in STDT and no inhibition in the SAI paradigm.

Two cases were reviewed in which patients underwent uncomplicated suboccipital craniectomy with expansive autologous pericranium duraplasty for Chiari decompression. Postoperatively, both patients awoke with hemibody sensory and motor deficits. Immediate postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small hemorrhage within the dorsal medulla in both cases. Follow-up imaging shows resolution along with near complete clinical recovery of deficits. These cases demonstrate a rare postdecompression surgery-related complication in Chiari malformation. We hypothesize that these hemorrhages may occur from the rapid drainage of cerebrospinal fluid resulting in a loss of positive pressure, allowing a low-pressure hemorrhage to occur.

The main lesions may involve nucleus ambiguus and the lateral spinothalamic tract. The typical reported clinical manifestations are hoarseness, dysphagia, pain, and temperature disturbance of contralateral body. The manifestations, however, may vary. We aim to report new manifestations of Avellis syndrome in this report. A 47-year-old Chinese peasant woman who felt sudden dizziness, nausea when she was doing the laundry was referred to our department from other hospital. She vomited the stomach contents once and complained numbness of the left trunk and limbs as well as coughing while drinking. The patient presented with palatopharyngeal paralysis, Horner syndrome, and diminished pain as well as temperature sensation in the contralateral face, trunk, and limbs. She also presented with ipsilateral prosopalgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and central poststroke pain. T2-weighted MRI images demonstrated a high-signal intensity lesion in the right medulla oblongata which indicated a banded infarction site. The patient was diagnosed with medulla oblongata infarction, Avellis syndrome, Horner syndrome, dysphagia, hemiparesthesia, ipsilateral prosopalgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and central poststroke pain. The patient was administrated aspirin to prevent the aggregation of platelet and rosuvastatin tablets to regulate lipids as well as to stabilize vascular plaque. She was injected with butylphthalide sodium chloride to improve nerve nutritional status and carbamazepine was prescribed to deal with prosopalgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Gabapentin and pregabalin were administrated to deal with the central poststroke pain. The symptoms of prosopalgia as well as glossopharyngeal neuralgia were gone, and dizziness, dysphagia, and Horner syndrome were significantly alleviated when she was discharged from the hospital while the interventions showed little effect on central poststroke pain.

30674865,Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in the Absence of Typical Radiological Changes: Can We Make a Diagnosis?,"AlTahan, Abdulrahman M; Berger, Thomas; AlOrainy, Ibrahim A; AlTahan, Husam",AlTahan,"BACKGROUND Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a serious opportunistic infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality. Its incidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has risen since the introduction of disease modifying drugs. In the absence of a specific treatment, the outcome depends heavily on early diagnosis, which illustrates the importance of the role of characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, when relying mainly on MRI, the diagnosis of cases with atypical radiological changes may be missed or delayed. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old female diagnosed with elapsing remitting MS in 2009 was started on interferon-beta-1b that was escalated to natalizumab due to progression of the disease. Later, she was shifted to fingolimod as testing for John Cunningham polyoma virus (JCV) antibodies was positive. Three years later, she presented with a 3-week history of progressive walking impairment associated with twitching of her facial muscles and abnormal sensation all over her body that was associated with left hemi-paresis and sensory changes, in addition to truncal ataxia, which was treated with steroids as a relapse of MS. However, the patient continued to deteriorate and developed significant cognitive and behavioral changes. In view of this clinical picture, the diagnosis of PML was raised in spite of her atypical brain MRI features. Treatment with fingolimod was stopped and a sample of her cerebrospinal fluid was sent for JCV DNA analysis, which came back positive at 11 copies/mL. Treatment with mirtazepine and mefloquine was started, but the patient deteriorated further, and MRI showed severe changes consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Intravenous steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin were given, and within a few weeks, the patient was stabilized and started to gradually improve. CONCLUSIONS In patients at risk for developing PML who present with typical clinical features, testing for JCV DNA is recommended even in the absence of typical radiological findings in order to prevent any delay in the diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.911521,PMC6354725,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 78-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of progressive numbness in bilateral lower extremities and gait disturbance. Neurological examination on admission showed mild bilateral paired paralysis of the lower limbs (manual muscle test: right 2/V; left 4/V) and marked numbness in the right lower limb. Neuroimaging revealed a solid mass with clear boundaries in the dorsal medulla oblongata appearing hypointense on T1-weighted imaging (WI), hyperintense on T2-WI, and hypointense on diffusion WI (DWI), with strong enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-WI. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed moderately elevated levels of protein and lymphocytic cells. Biopsy to determine the exact diagnosis revealed histological findings of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas and inflammatory infiltration, consistent with sarcoidosis. Postoperatively, corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone was initiated as soon as possible, resulting in marked reductions in lesion size. Follow-up neuroimaging after 12 months showed no signs of recurrence. Neurosarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose from routine neuroimaging and laboratory findings.

On additional cervical spinal MRI, it showed atypical MRI findings of SCI, considered late acute to early subacute phase, which were similar to those seen in the acute phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). Additional DWI revealed restricted diffusion. From these findings, it could be inferred that the patient's SCI occurred at the same time as the multifocal brain infarctions caused by atrial fibrillation.

Various theories have been suggested to explain its origin. It was first speculated that ISs arise from the region where the nerve roots lose their sheaths on penetrating the pia mater. Later, it was further predicted that ISs would contain both intra- and extramedullary parts and would be shaped like a dumbbell. However, no cases reported previously can support this assumption adequately. A 40-year-old woman presented with constant cervical pain, accompanied by progressive weakness of upper extremities and glove distribution numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a rare intra- and extramedullary dumbbell-shaped lesion of the medulla oblongata, which was partially removed via a midline suboccipital craniectomy. Histologic and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. Routine imaging performed 20 months after the initial resection revealed a regrowth of the intramedullary part, which was subsequently partially removed through a far-lateral approach, with symptoms alleviated. At 2-year follow-up, there continued to be no radiologic or clinical evidence of regrowth. To date and to our knowledge, there are only 16 reported cases of brainstem ISs, none of which contained both intra- and extramedullary components. We believe this is the first report of dumbbell schwannoma of the medulla oblongata with adequate radiologic evidence. The relevant literature is reviewed, and an assumption has been proposed that dumbbell or surfacing ISs arising near entry zones of sensory nerves, mixed cranial nerves, or ventral root may originate from the aberrant Schwann cells.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.11.126,,Brainstem tumor; Dumbbell shaped; Medulla oblongata; Schwannoma,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Lacunar pure sensory stroke (PSS) confined to thalamus is characterized by persistent or transient numbness, tingling, pain, burning, or another unpleasant sensation on one side of the body. However, in this condition a sensory loss to all primary modalities in the contralateral face and body is very often encountered. Also previous reported cases of PSS due to lacunar stroke in regions other than thalamus are characterized by the presence of sensory loss together with positive sensory symptoms, none of them reporting isolated paresthesia as the only clinical feature of PSS. We present a case of isolated paresthesia as only clinical manifestation of a lacunar PSS involving both trigeminal and medial lemniscus in dorsal paramedian pontine region.

In my institution, patients with UMN CN7 palsy would require admission for further investigations to look for central causes. Those who have an isolated LMN facial nerve palsy can be managed as outpatients. A 36-year-old gentleman presented to the ED with acute vertigo and right facial weakness. He had no known cardiac risk factors. His vital signs on presentation were: Temperature 36.6℃, blood pressure 142/68mmHg, pulse rate 92/min, and oxygen saturation level (SpO2) 100% on room air. Initial neurological examination revealed a right LMN CN7 palsy without any other cranial nerve, cerebellar, or pyramidal deficits. He was given symptomatic treatment for vertigo without relief. Repeat examination subsequently showed a right conjugate gaze palsy with gaze-evoked nystagmus. There was no limb weakness or numbness. Gait was noted to be unsteady with a broad-based stance and truncal ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his brain subsequently showed an infarct affecting the right facial colliculus in the dorsal pons. In my department, this was the first case of a young patient with a stroke presenting with LMN CN7 palsy. He was initially treated for a possible peripheral cause of his vertigo as he had a history of vestibular neuronitis, but without symptomatic improvement. Patients with neurological symptoms (e.g. vertigo) not resolving with initial treatment should prompt consideration for repeat neurological examination because the patient may have evolving neurological signs, as well as consider the potential for initial anchoring/cognitive bias. In this case, the gaze palsy and cerebellar signs were only noted on subsequent examination. Presence of LMN CN7 palsy with other associated neurological signs (including other cranial nerve palsies) would warrant further imaging to look for more sinister intracranial causes, including cerebral infarcts or space-occupying lesions.  This case serves to remind medical practitioners to strongly consider a central cause (e.g. stroke) for patients presenting with an LMN facial palsy, even in young patients in the absence of other vascular risk factors, especially when other neurological symptoms and signs are present.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.25053,PMC9200411,bell`s palsy; facial colliculus infarct; facial colliculus syndrome; facial palsy; vertigo,Case Reports,United States,eng

Lateral medullary syndrome results in damage to the corresponding cranial nerve nuclei and the nucleus tractus solitarius, with vertigo, ipsilateral ataxia, crossed sensory disturbances, Horner's sign, bulbar palsy, and other underlying symptoms or signs. However, cases with cardiac arrhythmia and other autonomic dysfunctions as the primary manifestations are less common. Clinically, sudden death occasionally occurs in patients with lateral medullary syndrome, which may be associated with severe cardiac arrhythmia. These patients may suffer in life-threatening arrhythmia and even cardiac arrest, and vital signs should be closely monitored to prevent sudden death. In younger patients, vertebral artery dissection is the most common cause. Here, we present a case of lateral medullary syndrome caused by vertebral artery dissection with severe bradycardia. The patient was a 49-year-old man who was admitted with ""sudden onset of numbness in the left limbs and right side of the face for 1 hour"". Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring showed a repeated heart rate decrease to as low as 23 beats/min, followed by a gradual increase in heart rate to 35-55 beats/min after 2-3 seconds. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed right dorsolateral cerebral infarction of the medulla oblongata. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a right vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm. We performed an emergency placement of a temporary pacemaker, followed by conservative treatment with platelet aggregation inhibitors, vascular softening agents and improved collateral circulation. Elective spring coil embolization of the vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm and stent implantation were performed. At outpatient follow-up, the patient had a good prognosis. Clinical management of patients with lateral medullary syndrome should be prioritized, with close cardiac monitoring at the early stages of observation and pacemaker placement and tracheal intubation as required to prevent adverse events.",{},,Annals of palliative medicine,10.21037/apm-22-1098,,Lateral medullary syndrome; bradycardia; case report; cerebral angiography; vertebral artery dissection,Review; Case Reports,China,eng

Carotid artery stenosis is an important and independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. The three current approaches for treating carotid artery stenosis are drug treatment, carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The approach is chosen based on the degree of stenosis. CEA or CAS could have been chosen for the current patient, who had severe carotid stenosis and an iodinated contrast allergy. After thoroughly communicating with the patient, the patient chose CAS for treatment. Therefore, we performed ultrasound-guided CAS to avoid the use of iodinated contrast. The main symptoms of the patient were numbness and weakness of the left limb. Computed tomography angiography of the head and neck at another hospital indicated multiple sites of stenosis in the arteries of the head and neck. The patient requested CAS for treatment but was allergic to iodinated contrast media. Thus, routine digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with iodinated contrast could not be used for the procedure. The diagnosis of this patient was as follows: (1) Right parietal lobe cerebral infarction; (2) multiple sites of stenosis in the arteries of the head and neck (severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, severe stenosis of the right subclavian artery); (3) right subclavian steal syndrome; and (4) hypertension (stage 3, high risk). The interventions included routine treatment for cerebral infarction, oral administration of clopidogrel (75 mg qd) and aspirin (100 mg qd), ultrasound-guided CAS, and postoperative follow-up. Postoperative color Doppler ultrasound and cerebrovascular magnetic resonance angiography of the carotid artery showed good vascular recovery, and the postoperative follow-up indicated a good prognosis. This case study suggests that ultrasound-guided endovascular treatment is a potential option for patients with contraindications to the iodinated contrast agents used in DSA-guided surgery, although excellent surgical operating skills are needed.",{},,World journal of clinical cases,10.12998/wjcc.v11.i25.5926,PMC10506023,Carotid angioplasty and stenting; Case report; Digital subtraction angiography; Gadolinium-based contrast agent; Iodinated contrast allergy; Subclavian artery angioplasty and stenting; Ultrasound-guided,Case Reports,United States,eng

Although various brain regions are susceptible to ICH, putaminal hemorrhage is the most common, whereas cortical ICH is less common. Here, we report the case of a 69-year-old man who developed a parietal cortical ICH. The patient developed hypoesthesia and paresthesia in the right upper lip and hand; however, the weakness was not severe. Twenty-five days after the ICH onset, the manual muscle test results were normal, but he had difficulty eating and shaving because of decreased hand dexterity. The rehabilitation focused on improving fine hand motor function and endurance. On the 94th day after ICH onset, paresthesia remained only in the fingertips, and the upper lip sensory change disappeared. Patients with sensory symptoms in the perioral area, hands, and brain lesions were previously referred to as having cheiro-oral syndrome (COS).

We searched the literature for documented cases and reviewed MRI findings before treatment. A 30-year-old Lebanese man, who had lived in Gabon for six years, presented with a two-year history of rash, anorexia, weight loss, arthralgia, paresthesia, and hypersomnia. Previously, the patient had received corticosteroid therapy for unconfirmed ANCA-associated vasculitis. Physical examination revealed a painless chancre on the left arm located at the site of an old insect bite, enlarged cervical, axillar and inguinal lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly and impaired concentration. Blood analysis showed an elevated protein level (90g/L) with hypoalbuminemia (24.2g/L) and elevated IgM (26.4g/L). Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy failed to detect any parasite. Polymerase chain reaction tests on blood and cerebrospinal fluid were positive for Trypanosoma. Serology tests confirmed the diagnosis of HAT due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection. 3T MRI showed lesions in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia, the internal capsule, and the mesencephalon bilaterally. Follow-up MRI showed interval progression of the abnormalities. Treatment with melarsoprol was followed by clinical improvement with regression of the lesions on the three-month MRI, then total resolution at the 10-month follow-up. This case highlights a pattern of mild MRI lesions in T. brucei gambiense HAT with a total and rapid resolution under treatment.

Benign and malignant diseases are known to cause this circumscribed symptom, which can easily be overlooked or misdiagnosed. In this article we present the very rare case of a clinical NCS caused by thalamic lacunar infarction. As a pure sensory stroke it is a rare variant of the Cheiro-Oral Syndrome (COS). A 63-year-old male patient received an emergency referral to our department after the patient had noticed a feeling of numbness of the left lower lip and chin on the previous day. The neurological examination revealed an approximately 2 × 3 cm area of hypoesthesia in the area of the chin and left lower lip and the cranial MRI an acute ischemia in the right thalamus.

At 1.5 months after stopping metronidazole, his symptoms of numbness and hyperesthesia had not improved, although he felt less ill. The isolated lesion disappeared on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. At 6 months later, the hyperesthesia symptoms remained, and he was unable to resume his previous work.

Thalamic pain syndrome, as is the case for other CPSPs, is difficult to treat, and the response is typically moderate at best. Central pain also occurs after vascular insults in parts of the CNS other than the thalamus. Only a few patients present with the classic ""Dejerine and Roussy syndrome,"" so the term CPSP is preferred for describing neuropathic pain after stroke. There are no pathognomonic features of this syndrome. The thalamus probably has a substantial role in some patients with central pain, either as a pain generator or by abnormal processing of ascending input. Long-term post-stroke pain disorders can reduce the quality of life, affect mood, sleep, and social functioning, and can lead to suicide. Hemi-body pain is common in patients with thalamic lesions. Hyperbaric oxygen has known physiologic and pharmacologic effects with documented benefits in brain-related hemorrhages, acute and chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroprotection, but has never been reported as a treatment for thalamic pain syndrome. A 55-year-old man with a history of migraines suffered a right thalamic lacunar infarction following a brain angiogram to investigate a suspected AVM found on prior imaging that resulted in immediate left-sided weakness and numbness, evolving to severe chronic pain and subsequent stiffness. Diagnosed with thalamic pain syndrome, multiple pharmacologic therapies provided only partial relief for a year after the stroke.

33825944,A sudden and severe depressive episode after a left cingulate gyrus stroke: a case report of post-stroke depression and review of literature.,"Ribeiro, Nuno Filipe; Madruga, Luís",Ribeiro,"Post-stroke depression is a frequent complication of cerebrovascular lesions and mainly occurs within the first 6 months after stroke. Stroke patients who develop depression have slower recovery, greater disability, and higher mortality rates. The pathophysiology of post-stroke depression is not yet clearly defined, but studies suggest contributions from both psychosocial factors and stroke-related factors, such as lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits. Early treatment has a positive impact on post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and survival. We present the case of an 82-year-old man with no psychiatric history who was brought to the psychiatric emergency department after two suicide attempts in the span of 7 days. He was severely depressed, with feelings of hopelessness, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. He had suffered a stroke the week before, affecting the anterior portion of the left cingulate gyrus, causing right hemiparesis and paresthesia. The psychiatric symptoms developed immediately after the stroke and were not present before the event. He was admitted to the psychiatry ward, treated with sertraline 100 mg/day and quetiapine 50 mg/day and discharged within 28 days, after full remission of symptoms. Our case strengthens the association between lesions located to the frontal-subcortical circuits and post-stroke depression. Physicians should be vigilant regarding the occurrence of depression in stroke patients, especially those who suffer lesions affecting the frontal-subcortical circuits and related regions.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",10.1007/s00702-021-02334-y,,Cingulate gyrus; Depression; Post-stroke depression; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Austria,eng

On admission, brain MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated high-signal-intensity lesions in the right frontal lobe. Although the symptoms had disappeared quickly, brain MRI on the 7th day revealed that these lesions had spread to the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right fronto-parietal lobes, appearing as high signal intensity lesions on ADC map. On the basis of the MRI imaging and clinical courses, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) caused by AZP was suspected, and brain MRI revealed the immediate improvement of the lesions after the AZP discontinuation.

33384403,Superficial Cerebral Venous Thrombosis and Intracerebral Hematoma in a 48-Year-Old Man with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case Report.,"Cardoso, Erico Ramos; Bains, Sandeep Singh; Robison, Benjamin; Farkas, Jeffrey",Cardoso,"BACKGROUND Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Severe respiratory symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, which may also include complications related to a hypercoagulable state and central nervous system involvement. These complications can occur during either the acute or the recovery phase. The cerebral involvement typically manifests as intracranial hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse encephalopathy, or cerebral venous thrombosis. The hemorrhagic form of cerebral venous thrombosis can be a diagnostic challenge and is treated by anticoagulation therapy, despite the existence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. This report describes a case of superficial cerebral venous thrombosis and intracerebral hematoma in a 48-year-old man weeks after recovering from the acute phase of SARSCoV-2 infection. CASE REPORT A 48-year-old man with a past medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction presented with left upper-limb numbness, weakness, and impaired positional sensorium. After initial stabilization, noncontrast computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an intracerebral hemorrhage with underlying cerebral venous thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with enoxaparin anticoagulation therapy, and symptoms improved over the following 12 days. CONCLUSIONS Central nervous system venous thrombosis is an atypical presentation of the hypercoagulable state primarily seen in younger patients, and it can occur in a delayed fashion after recovery from mild forms of COVID-19.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.927011,PMC7784591,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
37434618,Mechanical thrombectomy for middle cerebral artery occlusion caused by intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis: A case report.,"Shindo, Koichiro; Ishikawa, Kohei; Nomura, Ryota; Morishita, Masahiro; Oka, Koji; Nakamura, Hirohiko",Shindo,"Tandem internal carotid artery (ICA)/middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions are occasionally observed in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Most of them are caused by lesions at the origin of the ICA. In cases of intracranial ICA stenosis, the formation of a large thrombus causing MCA occlusion is extremely rare. Herein We report a case of acute MCA occlusion caused by intracranial ICA stenosis. A 62-year-old female presented with aphasia, right-side weakness, and a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed early ischemic infarction at the precentral gyrus. Left ICA and M1 occlusion were suspected on magnetic resonance angiography. However, the patient had complained of right-side numbness 6 days before the onset. Hence the stroke was assumed to have progressed slowly, and acute occlusion of the left ICA was eliminated as a suspected diagnosis. After admission, the symptoms worsened. MRI showed enlargement of the cerebral infarction. Computed tomography angiography showed complete occlusion of the left M1 and recanalization of the left ICA with severe stenosis of the petrous portion. The etiology of the MCA occlusion was determined to be atherothromboembolism. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed for ICA stenosis, followed by mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for the MCA occlusion. Recanalization of the MCA was achieved. After Seven days, the NIHSS score reduced from a pre-MT assessment of 17-2. PTA followed by MT was safe and effective for treating MCA occlusion caused by intracranial ICA stenosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.05.070,PMC10331069,Artery to artery embolism; Intracranial internal carotid artery stenosis; Mechanical thrombectomy; Middle cerebral artery occlusion; Tandem lesion,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

This study aimed to report a Chinese patient with acute bilateral pontine infarction manifesting as eight-and-a-half syndrome plus hemiplegia (atypical nine syndrome), and also the clinical and neuroimaging findings were explained and discussed with review of the literature. A 79-year-old woman experienced sudden vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and weakness at her left arm and leg. The neurological examination disclosed her right horizontal gaze palsy, internuclear ophtalmoplegia (INO), and right-sided peripheral facial paralysis combined with slight left-sided hemiplegia, which were consistent with atypical nine syndrome. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displayed acute multiple ischemic infarction, involving bilateral pontine tegmentum, basilar part of right paramedian pontine, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Intracranial MR angiography (MRA) revealed right middle cerebral artery occlusion, no clear visualization of bilateral vertebral arteries, and basilar artery hypoplasia with stenotic segments. Thrombolysis could not be performed due to the time window. The patient was given low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation because of posterior circulation and progressive stroke. The vertigo disappeared, and a notable improvement with minimal restriction in the right horizontal gaze and partial relief of her facial paralysis were found at discharge, while her left hemiparesis was fully resolved. No recurrence of cerebral infarction was observed during follow-up as well. This case report with atypical nine syndrome is fairly rare.

35114408,Interhemispheric Approach for Clipping of a Pericallosal Artery Aneurysm: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.,"Nagaraj, Anmol; Majmundar, Neil; Jumah, Fareed; Raju, Bharath; Nanda, Anil",Nagaraj,"Pericallosal artery aneurysms are rare, accounting for 2%-9% of all intracranial aneurysms. They are most commonly saccular and wide necked. Although typically small, they are more prone to rupture compared with other aneurysms in the anterior circulation. They are more common in people with unpaired or azygous arteries. Rupture of pericallosal artery aneurysm results in intracerebral hematoma in approximately 50% of patients, usually in the frontal lobe, anterior interhemispheric fissure, pericallosal cistern, or cingulate gyrus. Compared with other supratentorial aneurysms, surgical clipping of pericallosal aneurysms carries a higher morbidity and mortality. A 47-year-old female presented with sudden-onset worst headache of her life followed by dizziness, syncope, transient weakness, and numbness over the left lower extremity. She was neurologically intact, and imaging revealed a right pericallosal artery aneurysm. The patient consented to the procedure. The 2-dimensional Video 1 demonstrates the interhemispheric approach for clipping of a pericallosal artery aneurysm. These aneurysms are approached in the distal-to-proximal direction along with the distal anterior cerebral artery. Meticulous dissection avoids rupture without proximal control. We highlight the key surgical steps and microsurgical techniques in approaching these aneurysms. The patient tolerated the operation well with an uneventful postoperative course.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2022.01.093,,Aneurysm; Clipping; Distal ACA; Interhemispheric approach; Pericallosal artery aneurysm; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Video-Audio Media,United States,eng

He later developed hypoesthesia ascending from the lower extremities and consulted the emergency outpatient department with the chief complaint of generalised dysesthesia. Because of a history of ulcerative colitis, his condition was initially treated as acute aggravation of the disease; however, after admission, his consciousness level gradually deteriorated. Physical findings showed weakened tendon reflexes, and anti-GQ1b antibodies were strongly positive in the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (BBE). Plasmapheresis was performed 8 times, resulting in an improvement of the symptoms; the patient was discharged 1 month later. Campylobacter infections are the main cause of BBE, and its incidence is high among patients with ulcerative colitis. Therefore, in cases where patients with ulcerative colitis develop disturbance in consciousness, BBE should be included in the differential diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2012-007013,PMC4544198,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 30-year-old male presented with a three-year history of diffuse left upper extremity motor strength deficits and paresthesia (numbness and tingling). The patient had seen multiple physicians for these symptoms with no diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and no advanced imaging. The differential diagnosis included lower cervical spine nerve root compression or neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral lesion, motor neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord lesion. MRI of the cervical spine with and without IV contrast revealed evidence of spinal cord multiple sclerosis. The patient was referred to a neurologist where the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was confirmed. A 10-year follow-up showed the patient was controlling his condition with medications and had no disability. This case underscores the importance for physicians to consider neurological conditions and advanced imaging in the presence of diffuse motor strength deficits and paresthesia in the absence of injury, pain, or any other symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.62618,PMC11185423,chiropractic; diagnosis; history; imaging; multiple sclerosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 70-year-old female patient presented with numbness in the left side of face, arm, and leg. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion with intense gadolinium (Gd)-enhancement in the ventral portion of the midbrain. A stereotactic biopsy demonstrated mixed T-cell and B-cell infiltrating inflammatory lesions without demyelination. Three months after postoperative treatment with steroid, the lesion markedly decreased on follow-up MRI. Twenty-six months after the initial attack, she complained of dysarthria and urinary incontinence. Repetitive MRI showed a lesion with homogeneous enhancement, extensively involving the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, corpus callosum, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. The confirmed diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on the second biopsy. Despite our best efforts, she died 38 months after disease onset. Based on review of the literature and our case, preceding inflammatory lesions are not always demyelinating and T-cell dominant inflammatory lesions. When the initial biopsy reveals an inflammatory lesion in an old-aged patient, the clinician should keep in mind the development of PCNSL and perform close clinical and radiological observations for a timely diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci11020191,PMC7913965,diagnosis; inflammation; primary central nervous system lymphoma; tumefactive lesion; tumor regression,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Typical PML shows confluent, bilateral but asymmetric, subcortical lesions in the supratentorial white matter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report here a 50-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus complicated with lymphoma who developed PML with atypical brain MRI findings limited to the infratentorial area at presentation. She presented with numbness on the right side of the face, including her tongue, clumsiness of the right hand, and gait disturbance, after completion of remission induction therapy for lymphoma, including rituximab. Brain MRI demonstrated a solitary lesion limited to the cerebellum and brainstem, but a definitive diagnosis could not be made from cerebrospinal fluid study or tentative histologic evaluation of brain biopsy specimens. Despite methylprednisolone pulse therapy, her neurological deficits progressively worsened. One month later, in-depth analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of JCV. Eventually, the localised unilateral crescent-shaped cerebellar lesions on MRI expanded to the contralateral cerebellum, middle cerebellar hemisphere, pons, and midbrain and finally developed multifocal invasion into the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Our case suggests that PML could first present with a solitary infratentorial lesion in immunocompromised patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Modern rheumatology case reports,10.1080/24725625.2021.1899763,,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; granule cell neuronopathy; lymphoma; rituximab; systemic lupus erythematosus,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The contemporaneous detection of AQP4- and AGO-Abs led to a definite diagnosis of overlap syndrome of NMOSD with AGO-Abs. The patient was treated with immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids and immunoglobulins, and achieved remission. This case highlights a novel phenotype of NMOSD with AGO-Abs overlap syndrome, which presents with relapsing brainstem syndrome and longitudinally extensive myelitis with acute severe neurological involvement.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were measured using a region of interest method along the STP. DTT showed normal STP integrities as compared with normal controls. However, the FA values of the left STP at the thalamus were more than 2 SD decreased. The diminished FA value of the left STP in the left thalamus seems to indicate injury of the left ventrolateroposterior nucleus. Central pain and impaired touch sensation of right extremities supports the presence of left STP injury at the ventroposterolateral nucleus in this patient.

The rapid recovery of proximal quadriparesis also supports the concept that a functional pyramidal tract seems crucial for recovery after stroke.",{},,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0b013e3181ebe5b2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
29557687,Passive accessory joint mobilization in the multimodal management of chronic dysesthesia following thalamic stroke.,"Griffin, Kristina; O'Hearn, Michael; Franck, Carla C; Courtney, Carol A",Griffin,"<b>Study design:</b> Case Report. <b>Purpose:</b> Stroke is the most common cause of long-term disability. Dysesthesia, an unpleasant sensory disturbance, is common following thalamic stroke and evidence-based interventions for this impairment are limited. The purpose of this case report was to describe a decrease in dysesthesia following manual therapy intervention in a patient with history of right lacunar thalamic stroke. <b>Case description:</b> A 66-year-old female presented with tingling and dysesthesia in left hemisensory distribution including left trunk and upper/lower extremities, limiting function. Decreased left shoulder active range of motion, positive sensory symptoms but no sensory loss in light touch was found. She denied pain and moderate shoulder muscular weakness was demonstrated. Laterality testing revealed right/left limb discrimination deficits and neglect-like symptoms were reported. Passive accessory joint motion assessment of glenohumeral and thoracic spine revealed hypomobility and provoked dysesthesia. Interventions included passive oscillatory joint mobilization of glenohumeral joint, thoracic spine, ribs and shoulder strengthening. <b>Results:</b> After six sessions, shoulder function, active range of motion, strength improved and dysesthesia decreased. Global Rating of Change Scale was +5 and QuickDASH score decreased from 45% to 22% disability. Laterality testing was unchanged. <b>Conclusion:</b> Manual therapy may be a beneficial intervention in management of thalamic stroke-related dysesthesia. Implications for Rehabilitation While pain is common following thalamic stroke, patients may present with chronic paresthesia or dysesthesia, often in a hemisensory distribution. Passive movement may promote inhibition of hyperexcitable cortical pathways, which may diminish aberrant sensations. Passive oscillatory manual therapy may be an effective way to treat sensory disturbances such as paresthesias or dysesthesia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Disability and rehabilitation,10.1080/09638288.2018.1450453,,Manual therapy; central post-stroke pain; quantitative sensory testing; somatosensation; stroke rehabilitation; thalamic pain syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed hemorrhage from a pontine cavernous angioma. The patient experienced stepwise aggravation of symptoms due to repeated hemorrhages. We decided to surgically remove the pontine cavernous angioma through an anterior transpetrosal approach, since the angioma and hematoma were located near the ventrolateral surface of the pons. The brain stem was incised at a site caudal to the trigeminal nerve and the hematoma and angioma were totally removed. No additional neurological deficits were observed following surgery. Brain stem cavernous angiomas are usually removed via a trans-fourth ventricle or lateral suboccipital approach. However, these approaches may not be appropriate if the angioma is located ventrally to the pons. We propose that the anterior transpetrosal approach is the method of choice for ventrally located pontine cavernous angioma.",{},,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.42.272,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

A 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections, vitiligo, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura presented with right-sided numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic spine revealed a signal hyperintensity. MRI of the brain demonstrated FLAIR hyperintensity in the right middle frontal gyrus. Cerebral spinal fluid was unremarkable. Serum immunoglobulins revealed hypogammaglobulinemia. Endobronchial and subsequent mediastinum biopsies were all negative for sarcoidosis and malignancy. No infectious etiology was found. She was treated with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy for CVID-associated myelitis. Follow-up MRI showed improvement; however, her numbness persisted despite these treatments, which led to an outside physician adding methotrexate for their suspicion of sarcoidosis. Her symptoms remained stable for two years, but when the methotrexate dose was weaned, her numbness worsened. Upon review, the treatment team refuted the diagnosis of sarcoidosis but continued treatment with prednisone, IVIG, and methotrexate for CVID-associated myelitis, from which her symptoms have stabilized.

27603348,"A challenging diagnosis of late-onset tumefactive multiple sclerosis associated to cervicodorsal syringomyelia: doubtful CT, MRI, and bioptic findings: Case report and literature review.","Conforti, Renata; Capasso, Raffaella; Galasso, Rosario; Cirillo, Mario; Taglialatela, Gemma; Galasso, Luigi",Conforti,"Tumefactive multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unusual variant of demyelinating disease characterized by lesions with pseudotumoral appearance on radiological imaging mimicking other space-occupying lesions, such as neoplasms, infections, and infarction. Especially when the patient's medical history is incompatible with MS, the differential diagnosis between these lesions constitutes a diagnostic challenge often requiring histological investigation. An older age at onset makes distinguishing tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) from tumors even more challenging. We report a case of brain TDL as the initial manifestation of late-onset MS associated with cervico-dorsal syringomyelia. A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a 15-day history headache was referred to our hospital because of the acute onset of paraphasia. She suffered from noncommunicating syringomyelia associated to basilar impression and she reported a 10-year history of burning dysesthesia of the left side of the chest extended to the internipple line level. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations revealed a left frontal lesion with features suspicious for a tumor. Given the degree of overlap with other pathologic processes, CT and MRI findings failed to provide an unambiguous diagnosis; furthermore, because of the negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal bands, the absence of other lesions, and the heightened suspicion of neoplasia, the clinicians opted to perform a stereotactic biopsy. Brain specimen analysis did not exclude the possibility of perilesional reactive gliosis and the patient, receiving anitiedemigen therapy, was monthly followed up. In the meanwhile, the second histological opinion of the brain specimen described the absence of pleomorphic glial cells indicating a tumor. These findings were interpreted as destructive inflammatory demyelinating disease and according to the evolution of MRI lesion burden, MS was diagnosed. TDL still remains a problematic entity clinically, radiologically, and sometimes even pathologically. A staged follow-up is necessary, and in our case, it revealed to be the most important attitude to define the nature of the lesion, confirming the classic MS diagnostic criteria of disseminate lesions in time and space.

Today, the pathogenesis of BD remains mostly unknown. It is also suggested that the disease is probably related to autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and innate immunity damages were perceived as key in its pathologic process. Only 5% of BD patients have neurological involvement, and it usually occurs in 4-6 years after the initial symptoms. Early onset of neurological impairment makes it difficult to diagnose and treat definitely. <b>Case Presentation:</b> A 38-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with numbness and weakness of the left extremities. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed focal infarction in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Skin pathology suggested small vessel vasculitis, and high-resolution MRI revealed intracranial arteritis. The patient had a negative skin pathery test and then developed a scar at the venous puncture site at the early stage of disease. Laboratory examination showed that interleukin 8 (IL-8) increased. The patient was treated with an immunosuppressive agent including mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine. All symptoms were alleviated after half a year's treatment. There was neither stroke nor recurrence of oral ulcer thereafter. <b>Conclusion:</b> This case demonstrates that neurological involvement might be an early symptom of BD. IL-8 could act as a novel target for the treatment of BD theoretically and probably play a key role in disease recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2019.01102,PMC6817676,Behcet's disease; IL-8; cerebral arteritis; cerebral infarction; neuro-Behcet's disease,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The CM was completely removed, and no newly developed or worsening deficits were detected postoperatively. To better understand the OTFA and its application, the authors performed a cadaveric dissection.

When the patients arrive within the time-window for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) infusion therapy, no diagnostic protocol has been established. A 55-year-old woman was brought by ambulance to our hospital with complaints of sudden-onset dysarthria and left arm numbness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 5, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was 8. She was diagnosed with acute embolic stroke. At 4 h, 6 min after onset, intravenous administration of rt-PA (alteplase, 0.6 mg/kg) was started. Her neurological deficits improved rapidly, and her NIHSS score was 1. Brain MRI was then performed. There was no hemorrhagic transformation, but the MRI findings were not compatible with ischemic stroke. She had a past history of RA diagnosed 6 months earlier, and she had been treated with methotrexate (10 mg daily). She was diagnosed with RMSA, and continuous infusion of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily was started for 3 days. The high signal intensity on the FLAIR image disappeared. CT-based decision-making for rt-PA injection is reasonable, but MRI is needed for the early diagnosis of RMSA. In this case, it is particularly important that neither adverse events nor bleeding complications were observed, suggesting the safety of CT-based thrombolytic therapy in RMSA.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-018-1143-z,PMC6126002,Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA); Rheumatoid meningitis; Stroke mimics,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
7101342,Pure sensory stroke and allied conditions.,"Fisher, C M",Fisher,"This paper contains an analysis of 135 cases in which numbness, either episodic or persistent, involved one side of the body. In most cases, the patients were candidates for the diagnosis of pure sensory stroke which is usually the result of an occlusive cerebrovascular lesion involving the thalamus. The cases are divided into three main categories, pure sensory stroke, pure sensory TIAs, and atypical cases. The clinical features described in an earlier paper have been confirmed for the most part. A major limitation is the paucity of pathological studies. The lack of reliable criteria for the recognition of migrainous paresthesias has probably resulted in the inadvertent inclusion of some such cases. Some other conditions, hemidysesthesia and cervical disc, which have had to be considered in the differential diagnosis have been included. Cases of occlusive disease of the posterior cerebral internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries have been analyzed for patterns of paresthesias which may serve to distinguish cortical lesions from thalamic.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.13.4.434,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, head and lung CT angiography, jugular venography, cardiac color Doppler ultrasound scan, color Doppler ultrasound scan of the neck and lower vascular extremities and 24-hour, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring were performed. A 50-year-old male experienced a total of 31 onsets of weakness in the right side of his body, speech impairment and numbness in the right side of his body during a period of 20 days. Imaging results did not reveal evidence of a cerebral infarction. The potential of a TIA with an arterial origin and other causes were ruled out, and a left brachiocephalic vein thrombosis and left jugular vein congestion were discovered. Thus, the brachiocephalic vein thrombosis was considered to be the cause of the TIA. The patient received anticoagulant and antiplatelet aggregation treatment. On the following day after the termination of the TIA, a color Doppler ultrasound scan detected the opening of the jugular venous arch, but the blood flow that returned to the superior vena cava via the left brachiocephalic vein did not significantly increase. A brachiocephalic vein thrombosis can be the cause of a TIA. In addition to the anticoagulant and antiplatelet aggregation treatment, the opening of the collateral of veins, including that of the jugular venous arch, may play an important role in reducing venous congestion and in terminating TIAs.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207454.2012.762916,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Occasionally, they present with focal neurologic deficits, a dementia-like syndrome, hemorrhage, or ischemic infarction. This study is based on the case of a 71-year-old gentleman who presented with 6 months of progressive forgetfulness, inattention, and hypersomnolence. Four weeks prior to presentation, he developed symptoms of left-sided pain, numbness, and worsening weakness. Neurologic examination demonstrated hypersomnolence, a score of 30/38 on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and left hemiparesis. MRI brain revealed bilateral thalamic T2 hyperintensities with associated enhancement. MR venogram (MRV) showed a vascular malformation in the posterior fossa and occlusion of the straight sinus. Conventional cerebral angiogram confirmed a tentorial dAVF. The dAVF was definitively treated with transarterial embolization, followed by clip ligation of the arterialized draining vein. Twelve weeks later, there was clinical resolution of left hemiparesis and improvement in cognitive status. MRI revealed complete resolution of the thalamic hyperintensities. MRV demonstrated recanalization of the straight sinus. Intracranial dAVFs are uncommon but potentially life-threatening acquired vascular malformations. The initiating factor is venous hypertension, causing retrograde flow, venous congestion, ischemia, and sometimes infarction. The spectrum of clinical manifestations in dAVFs reflects the degree of venous congestion present. If retrograde venous flow is surgically obliterated, then venous hypertension may be reversible. Bilateral thalamic venous congestion can present as a thalamic dementia. We conclude that intracranial dAVFs with thalamic venous congestion should be considered in the diagnostic differential for patients who present with subacute cognitive decline and T2 hyperintense thalamic signal change.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-012-9746-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, if a symptom is not presented as drop attack or hemiplegia, and alarming to the patient and the physician, how short of a symptom duration would raise the concern of a physician for TIA? It will be more complicated if the location of the neurological deficit is vagrant. This report highlights a rare TIA case which presented a very short duration of migratory patchy distribution numbness. A middle-aged gentleman was presented with recurrent patchy distribution numbness on the right side of the body for 2 months, with the episode lasting as short as about 10 s. The location of the numbness was erratic and migratory. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed mild stenosis on the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Transcranial Doppler (TCD) micro-emboli monitoring detected positive micro-emboli signals (MES), leading to the confirmation of a TIA diagnosis. After a standard dual antiplatelet treatment combined with enhanced lipid reduction therapy with statins, MES disappeared on dynamic TCD emboli monitoring, and no more episodes of TIA have been noticed on the follow-ups. TIA caused by micro-emboli can display as recurrent migratory neurological deficit within seconds. TCD micro-emboli monitoring is very helpful to differentiate this situation from TIA mimics with follow-ups, as well as to locate unstable plague.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01955-2,PMC7682009,Case report; Micro-embolic signals; Migratory numbness; Transcranial Doppler; Transient ischemic attack,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Spontaneous artery dissection causing brain ischemia is rare in all ischemic strokes. However, in young to middle-aged patients with brain ischemia, spontaneous carotid or vertebral artery dissection causing ischemic stroke accounts for 10-25%. A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of left-arm paresthesia and numbness followed by symptoms of vertigo and vomiting. A neurological examination showed left-arm paresthesia, horizontal-rotational nystagmus, and left-side dysmetria according to a finger-to-nose test. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left subclavian artery dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrated hyperintensity in the left medulla oblongata and inferior part of the cerebellum. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Spontaneous artery dissection is an important etiology of ischemic stroke among young patients. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial dissection. Cervical disc disease is a common etiology in a patient with neck and shoulder pain without cause or neurologic symptoms, when cervical MRI is negative, however, spontaneous subclavian artery dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient, especially in a case of younger patient, presents with acute new-onset neck and shoulder pain followed by the onset of neurological symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2017.06.030,,brain infarction; subclavian artery dissection; vertebral artery dissection,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 42-year-old woman experienced facial numbness, diplopia, and ataxia. A magnetic resonance (MR) study revealed a pontine cavernoma with hemorrhage. Two weeks later, recurrence of the patient's symptoms and consciousness disturbance were noted. An MR study revealed massive hemorrhage from the cavernoma with a ventricle dilatation. An operation on the lesion was conducted 3 months after the initial hemorrhage. However, the operation was aborted when an exploration of the lesion showed a tight adhesion between the lesion and the pons. Removal of only a biopsy specimen and evacuation of the suckable hematoma were done. No neurologic recovery and no decrease in the size of the cavernoma were detected postoperatively. Her family did not wish for further treatments. She was in a bedridden state with severe brainstem dysfunction when she was transferred to a local hospital. Sixteen months after the surgery, her consciousness was clear, and MR imaging confirmed a marked reduction in the size of the cavernoma.

The occipital symptoms persisted and vertigo and vomiting developed after 6 days. Numbness developed on the left side of the patient's face, and hyperalgesia on the right side of the body.

Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial posterior circulation have been shown to be less uncommon than previously thought. However, those involving the PICA without involvement of the vertebral artery at all are extremely rare. The natural history of the dissecting PICA aneurysm was unknown, and the indication for surgical treatment of such aneurysms remains controversial.

Trauma is both penetrative and trivial, which can lead to carotid artery dissection. In the current study, we present an unusual case in which carotid artery dissection was potentially triggered by the damaging thermal effect of 7D High-Intensity Macro- and Micro-Focused Ultrasound (7D HIFU), which has been proposed as a safe and effective non-surgical modality for skin rejuvenation. A 41-year-old woman developed headache and clinical manifestations of cerebral infarction after 7D HIFU, aimed at removing neckline. Head and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed severe stenosis and dissection of the left internal carotid artery. Neither the patient's history nor the physical examination showed any special indicators. After resection of the left carotid artery dissection, autologous great saphenous vein interposition grafting, and simple mastoidectomy, the patient underwent head and neck MRA, which revealed recanalization of the left internal carotid artery. Although mild or moderate complications of 7D HIFU, such as erythema, edema, transient dysesthesia, and motor nerve paresis, have been previously reported, a few previous literature studies documented severe complications of the cosmetic procedure. However, many recent studies pointed out the possibility of 7D HIFU damaging adjacent non-target tissues due to inadequate focal depth of HIFU treatment. Our case is the first to indicate that 7D HIFU could cause carotid artery dissection. We propose that better visualization systems and more rigorous operator training are needed to reduce the risk of the potential off-target damaging effect of 7D HIFU by reporting the case in which the damaging heat effect of 7D HIFU precipitated the carotid artery dissection HIFU.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,10.3389/fcvm.2022.913754,PMC9433797,7D High-Intensity Macro- and Micro-Focused Ultrasound; case report; peripheral vascular disease; surgery; traumatic carotid artery dissection,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
27001236,Ipsilateral Dural Thickening and Enhancement: A Sign of Isolated Cortical Vein Thrombosis? A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Croci, Davide Marco; Michael, Diepers; Kahles, Timo; Fathi, Ali-Reza; Fandino, Javier; Marbacher, Serge",Croci,"Isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT) being a rare condition (6% of intracranial vein thromboses), no clinical guidelines and few radiologic clues to it have been established. ICVT mostly appears in conjunction with sinus vein thromboses. ICVTs primarily occur during pregnancy and puerperium (35%). The great variability of cortical veins and difficulty identifying small occluded vessels complicate ICVT diagnosis. We present the first case of isolated ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement as a potential radiologic sign of ICVT shown on magnetic resonance imaging. A 30-year-old woman presented with sudden position-independent severe headache and neck pain 2 weeks postpartum. Standard magnetic resonance imaging revealed ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement of the meninges (left hemisphere). The symptoms and findings were interpreted as a post-lumbar puncture syndrome associated with the epidural anesthesia during labor and birth. Deteriorating, the patient was referred to our hospital after a computed tomography scan had revealed atypical left parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Digital cerebral subtraction angiography confirmed a left parietal ICVT as the underlying disease. When systemic anticoagulation was initiated, the patient's condition further deteriorated. Progressive aphasia and right-sided face and arm weakness and numbness developed as a result of increased intracranial hemorrhage volume. We therefore performed craniotomy and hematoma evacuation, after which the patient fully recovered. We hypothesize that ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement in patients presenting with severe headache may indicate ICVT and we suggest further diagnostic workup, using venographic study such as computed tomographic venography or magnetic resonance venography. In an inconclusive venographic study with high clinical suspicion for ICVT, catheter cerebral angiography is indicated.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.03.026,,Ipsilateral dural thickening; Isolated cortical vein thrombosis; Magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

This case challenges existing classifications and treatment strategies for dAVFs, highlighting the need for further research and discussion within the neurosurgical community. A 56-year-old male was admitted to the hospital presenting with dizziness, fatigue, and numbness. Brain CT scans revealed extensive bilateral cerebral hemorrhages. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) identified a complex torcular dAVF. No cerebral sinus venous thrombosis was detected, but a venous variation in the left transverse sinus was observed. Preoperative DSA demonstrated the patient's well-developed venous compensatory ability. Subsequently, the patient underwent transarterial embolization. The patient made a good recovery. Follow-up DSA and MR angiography at 3 months and 1 year post-treatment showed no recurrence. DAVFs are rare lesions, prone to ICH, particularly when CVR is involved. We report a rare case of CVR with severe varix leading to hemorrhagic lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. Our aim is to alert neurosurgical colleagues worldwide to this potential new subtype and to evaluate treatment options, in order to assist those who may encounter such cases in the future.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2023.1303234,PMC10757922,cortical venous reflux; dural arteriovenous fistula; intracerebral hemorrhage; superior sagittal sinus; venous compensation; venous variation,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Case report.,"Grossi, Peter M; Ellis, Michael J; Cummings, Thomas J; Gray, Linda L; Fukushima, Takanori; Sampson, John H",Grossi,"Cholesterol granulomas (CGs) are benign lesions resulting from an inflammatory reaction to cholesterol and hemosiderin. These masses most often arise within the temporal bone or nasal sinuses; intracerebral CGs are extremely rare. In this report the authors present an unusual case of a CG arising within the lateral ventricle. The patient presented with transient hemiparesis and numbness. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic partially enhancing midline mass within the right lateral ventricle, expanding the ventricle and displacing the septum pellucidum. The patient underwent an interhemispheric, transcallosal resection of the lesion. Microscopic examination revealed a granulomatous inflammatory lesion containing cholesterol clefts, macrophages, and hemosiderin. Embedded within the granulomatous response were foci of tiny cystlike structures lined by nonciliated flattened cuboidal epithelium, consistent with the diagnosis of CG. To the authors' knowledge this is the first reported case of CG presenting as an intraventricular mass. The origin of this lesion is unclear, but it may relate to prior traumatic brain injury.

At 3.5months post-SRS for TN, the patient developed ataxia and left leg paraesthesiae and brain MRI showed altered signal and enhancement in the vicinity of the right trigeminal root entry zone (REZ). The symptoms remitted following treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, however, 10months post-SRS, the patient developed gait ataxia and left lower limb weakness. MRI showed persistent T2 changes at the REZ and multiple new non-enhancing white matter lesions in the cerebrum and spinal cord; and oligoclonal bands were present in the cerebrospinal fluid but not serum. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was made. This report raises the issue of whether the risk of radiation-induced toxicity is increased in patients with MS treated with SRS.

We describe a patient presenting with the potentially devastating signs and symptoms of thalamic stroke, at least temporally related to spinal cord stimulator implantation. The etiology of the patient's affliction was subsequently revealed to be a conversion disorder. Case report A 37-year-old woman presented for spinal cord stimulation as treatment of her brachial plexopathy after failure of conservative therapy. Before implantation, she underwent a clinical interview with a psychologist and psychometric testing. No psychological pathology was detected. Trial and permanent implantation of the cervical stimulator lead and pulse generator were uneventful. Eleven days after receiving the permanent implant, the patient experienced right-sided hemicorporal numbness and burning dysesthesia. The patient was admitted, and a diagnosis of Dejerine-Roussy syndrome (thalamic stroke) was made. She was discharged, and her symptomatology waxed and waned over a period of weeks. The patient was subsequently admitted for psychiatric evaluation because of anxiety attacks. During her protracted admission, her psychiatrists strongly suspected a conversion disorder. The stimulator was removed, and the patient received supportive care only. Within 6 months, sensory symptoms and all motor deficits had completely resolved. Despite careful preoperative evaluation, latent psychosocial issues may limit the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation. We present a case of conversion disorder masquerading as Dejerine-Roussy syndrome after spinal cord stimulation.

30669616,Sustained Opening of the Blood-Brain Barrier with Progressive Accumulation of White Matter Hyperintensities Following Ischemic Stroke.,"Naqvi, Imama; Hitomi, Emi; Leigh, Richard",Naqvi,"To report a patient in whom an acute ischemic stroke precipitated chronic blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and expansion of vascular white matter hyperintensities (WMH) into regions of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) during the following year. WMH are a common finding in patients with vascular risk factors such as a history of stroke. The pathophysiology of WMH is not fully understood; however, there is growing evidence to suggest that the development of WMH may be preceded by the BBB disruption in the NAWM. We studied a patient enrolled in the National Institutes of Health Natural History of Stroke Study who was scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after presenting to the emergency room with an acute stroke. After a treatment with IV tPA, she underwent further MRI scanning at 2 h, 24 h, 5 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1-year post stroke. BBB permeability images were generated from the perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) source images. MRIs from each time point were co-registered to track changes in BBB disruption and WMH over time. An 84-year-old woman presented after acute onset right hemiparesis, right-sided numbness and aphasia with an initial NIHSS of 13. MRI showed diffusion restriction in the left frontal lobe and decreased blood flow on perfusion imaging. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral confluent WMH involving the deep white matter and periventricular regions. She was treated with IV tPA without complication and her NIHSS improved initially to 3 and ultimately to 0. Permeability maps identified multiple regions of chronic BBB disruption remote from the acute stroke, predominantly spanning the junction of WMH and NAWM. The severity of BBB disruption was greatest at 24 h after the stroke but persisted on subsequent MRI scans. Progression of WMH into NAWM over the year of observation was detected bilaterally but was most dramatic in the regions adjacent to the initial stroke. WMH-associated BBB disruption may be exacerbated by an acute stroke, even in the contralateral hemisphere, and can persist for months after the initial event. Transformation of NAWM to WMH may be evident in areas of BBB disruption within a year after the stroke. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between chronic BBB disruption and progressive WMH in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and the potential for acute stroke to trigger or exacerbate the process leading to the development of WMH.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci9010016,PMC6356213,blood-brain barrier; cerebral small vessel disease; permeability imaging; stroke; white matter hyperintensities,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Nervous system involvement is frequent, especially in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), in the form of mononeuritis multiplex. However, subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, cranial nerve palsies, and cortical blindness have also been reported in the literature. Initial therapy involves systemic GC, which are not free of complications. We present the case of a patient with EGPA of more than 20 years duration who suddenly developed bilateral paresthesia of the lower limbs and urinary retention. The neurological exam revealed paraplegia with a sensorial level in D4; the MRI showed spinal cord compression in the D2-D7 level, and the patient was emergently submitted to surgical decompression. The histopathology of the surgical specimen demonstrated the presence of epidural adipose tissue with multiple vasculitic lesions. The effects of systemic corticosteroid therapy may contribute to abnormal fat deposition in various body segments, including the neuroaxis, leading to the development of epidural lipomatosis. However, the intra-lesional vasculitic character is a unique manifestation of myelopathy that has shown us to have a more aggressive attitude.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v95i1.14209,PMC10734229,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

She was well until 9 months prior to the present admission to our hospital, when she had an acute onset of left hemiparesis which turned out to have been caused by a thalamic infarct. Her hemiparesis showed nearly complete recovery during the next four months. She noted an onset of severe spontaneous pain and difficulty in using her left hand four months prior to the present admission. Neurologic examination on admission revealed an alert and well oriented Japanese woman. Cranial nerves were intact. Although she did not have weakness, her left hand showed thalamic posture, and upon standing, she showed a dystonic posture in which her left forearm took pronation and flexion at the elbow joint and her left lower extremity took extension in the knee joint and planter flexion in the ankle joint. Her dystonic posture increased during walking and disappeared in the supine position. She complained of severe spontaneous pain and tingling sensation in her left extremities. Position sense was diminished in her left leg. However other sensations were intact. She had slight ataxia on the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric, but the planter response was extensor on the left side. MRI revealed a small lacunar infarct involving the right posterolateral thalamic region. EMG with surface electrodes revealed non-reciprocal tonic discharges in the left biceps brachii and forearm flexor and extensor muscles. She responded poorly to various medications. Only trihexyphenidyl showed partial alleviation of her pain and dystonic posture. We thought her pain might be caused by dystonic contraction of the skeletal muscles, at least in part. We injected 25 IU of botulinus toxin as a total dose into her biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and wrist flexor muscles. A few days after the injection, her dystonic posture began to show marked improvement; as her dystonia improved, her pain also showed marked improvement. This patient appeared to represent a case of post-hemiplegic dystonia. Her pain was initially thought to be the thalamic pain. However, as her pain disappeared with improvement of her dystonia, her pain is most likely to have been caused by the dystonic muscle contraction.

Testing of somatosensory (SSEP) and pain-related evoked potential (PREP) was done, and the lesion location was mapped to the template brain. The patient had impaired touch and pain but preserved proprioception. He had a normal SSEP response but a prolonged PREP. The lesion was mapped to Broadmann areas 1 and 3b of the postcentral gyrus. Sensory cortical representation is such that, the ulnar fingers are medial, and the radial ones are lateral. Also, modality-specific organization is noted with tactile sensation being mapped to areas 1 and 3b, and proprioceptive sensation to area 3a and 2. Thus focal lesions involving the post central gyrus can have selective sensory loss over some fingers and can have selective impairment of some modalities.

It is particularly important to obtain the typical or characteristic symptoms and signs of the patients through comprehensive physical examination. We report a case of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction with ""episodic postural diplopia"" as the initial symptom, hoping that clinicians notice the vertical diplopia caused by the disfunction of otolith gravity conduction pathway, which is characterized by the degree of diplopia being affected by postural changes. A 44-year-old man was in hospital due to episodic postural diplopia for 4 months, dizziness and unstable walking for 5 days. In the past four months, the patient had endured episodic diplopia attack for 8 times when standing or walking, which could be relieved obviously while lying down and gradually disappeared within 5-10 minutes. He had not seen a doctor since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Five days before admission, diplopia worsened accompanying obvious vertigo, nausea and vomiting, left facial numbness, and hiccups. The diplopia could be relieved after taking the supine position, but not completely disappear as before. Physical examination showed a triad of ocular tilt response (OTR), namely static ocular rotation (SOT), skew deviation (SD) and head tilt (HT). And also subjective visual vertical (SVV) deviation was found. Those signs were considered for otolith gravity conduction system involvement. Combined with other clinical signs, such as Horner signs, crossed sensory disorders, ataxia, and MRI scan, it was easy to find the infarction was in the territory of the left PICA. The reasons for the patient's ""episodic posi-tional diplopia"" in the early stage of the disease were considered as follows: (1) the gravity was less affected in the supine position, the stimulation of the otolith gravity conduction pathway was reduced, so the degree of eye deviation was reduced in the supine position. (2) As an ischemic cerebrovascular disease, the patient experienced a process of transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the posterior circulation, the cerebral blood supply and the hypoperfusion of stenosis were increased after lying down, so the diplopia symptom disappeared.

We present a case of hemifacial spasm caused by a peritorcular type of large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa. A 68-year-old woman presented with right facial numbness 4 months ago and right hemifacial spasm 2 weeks ago. Upon visiting our hospital, she displayed no neurological deficits other than the right hemifacial spasm. MRI revealed a peritorcular type of large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa with perifocal edema. The right cerebellopontine cistern was narrowed, and the cerebellar tonsil was herniated. The right facial nerve ran adjacent to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). Angiography showed that only the left posterior meningeal artery (PMA) flowed to the tumor. The loop of the right AICA extended into the right cerebellopontine cistern. After embolization of the PMA, the tumor was surgically removed, leading to an improvement in the patient's hemifacial spasm. Postoperative MRI confirmed complete removal of the tentorial meningioma without any contact with the right facial nerve. The hemifacial spasm was caused secondarily by the cerebellar or brainstem shift due to the large tentorial meningioma in the posterior fossa. This large tumor had not produced any other neurological deficits before the hemifacial spasm appeared. We report this case because it is extremely rare.",{},,Journal of UOEH,10.7888/juoeh.45.237,,hemifacial spasm; peritorcular typ; posterior fossa; tentorial meningioma,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

38457578,Unconsciousness as the main nonfocal symptom of anterior circulation transient ischemic attack: A case report.,"Dong, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Ziliang; Li, Bin; Ma, Wenbin; Chen, Jinbo; Su, Yipeng",Dong,"Unconsciousness is a nonfocal symptom of transient ischemic attack (TIA) that is frequently observed in patients with vertebrobasilar artery stenosis or occlusion. Conversely, loss of consciousness due to anterior circulation involvement (e.g., middle cerebral artery [MCA]) is a rare occurrence in TIA. This report describes a rare case in a 59-year-old woman who experienced recurrent episodes of altered consciousness because of the occlusion or stenosis of her MCAs. The diagnosis of the case was updated from TIA to acute cerebral infarction, finally. Following initial loss of consciousness, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any evidence of acute cerebral infarction. However, following the second and third episodes of unconsciousness, the MRI revealed multiple new acute cerebral infarcts affecting both the cerebral hemispheres. Further evaluation through digital subtraction angiography disclosed complete occlusion of the left MCA and severe stenosis of the right MCA. Early in her illness, the patient was treated with vasodilators, aspirin and atorvastatin. Finally, 2 stents in her right and left MCAs were placed respectively, followed by treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, and double-dosed atorvastatin calcium. Meanwhile, the patient focused on avoiding conditions which may lead to dehydration in her daily life routine. The episodes of unconsciousness of this patient were completely resolved. During the 1-year postoperative follow-up, the patient remained clinically stable without any symptoms of unconsciousness, limb numbness or weakness, or dizziness. These findings suggested that hypoperfusion in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres played a pivotal role in precipitating the patient episodes of unconsciousness. This case underscores the possibility that occlusion or severe stenosis in both MCAs can contribute to recurrent episodes of unconsciousness due to hypoperfusion. Moreover, it emphasizes the association between these episodes of unconsciousness and an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000037343,PMC10919491,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Multiple ring-enhancing lesions have been reported in adult patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis but have not yet been reported in childhood multiple sclerosis. We report here a 14-year-old girl with recurrent neurologic symptoms. Her initial brain MRI showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions involving numerous white-matter fiber tracts. An extensive investigation for infectious etiologies was unrevealing. Studies of cerebrospinal fluid showed an elevated myelin basic protein and the presence of an oligoclonal band not seen in the serum. The results of electrophysiologic studies suggested a demyelinating process. The patient responded rapidly to high-dose corticosteroid treatment. However, she suffered a clinical relapse 3 months later, presenting with dysesthesia and weakness of the right arm. Repeat MRI showed multiple new active lesions. This case report illustrates that multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain MRI can be seen in children with multiple sclerosis and that multiple sclerosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when encountering a pediatric patient with similar radiographic findings.",{},,Journal of child neurology,10.1177/088307380201700121,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Seventeen patients met these criteria and were treated with GKS to the pituitary. The target was the pituitary gland together with the border between the pituitary stalk and the gland. The maximum dose was 140 to 180 Gy. All patients were followed for more than 3 months. An initial significant pain reduction was observed in 13 (76.5%) of 17 patients.

TMS is characterized by solitary or multiple lesions that are sized > 2 cm, with/without mass effect, edema, and ring enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The demyelinating lesion can mimic infections, vascular lesions, and inflammatory lesions. The clinical presentation is highly dependent on the area of the brain which is affected, and this can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms. Herein, we present the case of a 40-year-old immunocompetent female with a history of right-sided numbness of her face, arm, and leg associated with muscle weakness for about a week. Workup included an MRI showing ring-enhancing lesions in the white matter of the brain, zero oligoclonal bands in the CSF, a normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) index, and an elevated myelin basic protein (MBP) in the CSF. A biopsy was obtained that showed predominant macrophage infiltrate with loss of myelin but the preservation of axons. Suspecting a demyelinating pathology, the patient was informed that she would be started on intravenous dexamethasone for an eight-day course. With subsequent completion of this course in the hospital, the patient was discharged on oral prednisone daily for a month and a referral leading to a definitive diagnosis of TMS. The patient was started on interferon beta-1a and subsequently relapsed due to noncompliance. However, further workup showed a reduction in the mass-like lesions and a response to therapy. If suspicion for TMS is high despite workup, steroids can be used with immunomodulators in the interim to combat symptoms and potentially reduce lesions and potentially subvert the need for biopsy.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.3738,PMC6384036,immunocompetent; immunomodulators; ms therapy; multiple sclerosis; ring-enhancing lesion; space-occupying lesion; tms therapy; tumefactive multiple sclerosis (tms),Case Reports,United States,eng

A 29-year-old woman without neurofibromatosis presented with progressing dysesthesia in her lower limbs, low back pain, and intermittent claudication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intradural extramedullary mass lesion at the Th10/11 level. The patient underwent a tumor resection. Intraoperative findings indicated that the tumor had no dural attachment. Histopathological diagnosis after gross total removal was microcystic meningioma (grade I, WHO 2007). Seven years after the first operation, other lesions appeared at the levels of Th11/12, L1, and L2/3 in MRI. These tumors were slow growing and became symptomatic; thus, a second surgery was performed 14 years after the first operation.

Dynamic patterns of CCMs, obtained with spin-echo magnetic resonance images with gradient-echo sequences, were compared with serial serum VEGF concentrations, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemistry of the specimen displayed increased VEGF expression. Serial magnetic resonance images during 7 months showed dynamic signal changes of the preexisting lesions and 15 de novo formations in many cortices.

Intraparenchymal bleedings due to hemangioblastomas are even less frequent, and these hemorrhages are almost exclusively located in the supratentorial brain, cerebellum and spinal cord. We report the first case of a brainstem hemorrhage due to a hemangioblastoma of the medulla oblongata. A 47-year-old woman presented with acute onset of headache, anarthria, inability to swallow, left-sided hemiparesis and hemidysesthesia with varying states of vigilance, finally developing acute respiratory failure. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small hemangioblastoma of the posterior medulla oblongata causing intraparenchymal hemorrhage and acute occlusive hydrocephalus due to intraventricular hematoma extension. After implantation of an external ventricular catheter to treat acute hydrocephalus, the hemangioblastoma as well as its associated hemorrhage could be removed in toto via a microsurgical posterior median suboccipital approach with minimal foramen magnum enlargement. During the follow-up period of six months postoperatively the patient showed good recovery with only slight residual neurological deficits. The most common causes of brainstem hemorrhages are arterial hypertension and cavernous hemangiomas. However, hemangioblastomas should not be ignored as a possible differential diagnosis for intraparenchymal brainstem hemorrhage. While the prognosis in hypertensive brainstem bleedings is mostly disastrous and surgery rarely indicated, an operative therapy should be considered in cases of hemorrhages caused by underlying tumors.

Though the latter complaints resolved following day, her behavioral complaints persisted. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain revealed acute non-hemorrhagic infarct in bilateral PCA territory. Psychotropics were beneficial for her behavioral symptoms. Isolated behavioral symptoms in PCA stroke led to speculate anatomical substrate for those symptoms.

12474992,Central hyperacusis with phonophobia in multiple sclerosis.,"Weber, H; Pfadenhauer, K; Stöhr, M; Rösler, A",Weber,"Hearing disorders are a well-described symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Unilateral or bilateral hyperacusis or deafness in patients with normal sound audiometry is often attributed to demyelinating lesions in the central auditory pathway. Less known in MS is a central phonophobia, whereby acoustic stimuli provoke unpleasant and painful paresthesia and lead to the corresponding avoidance behaviour. In our comparison collective, patient 1 described acute shooting pain attacks in his right cheek each time set off by the ringing of the telephone. Patient 2 complained of intensified, unbearable noise sensations when hearing nonlanguage acoustic stimuli. Patient 3 noticed hearing unpleasant echoes and disorders of the directional hearing. All patients had a clinical brainstem syndrome. ENT inspection, sound audiometry and stapedius reflex were normal. All three patients had pathologically changed auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) with indications of a brainstem lesion, and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demyelinating lesions in the ipsilateral pons and in the central auditory pathway. The origin we presume in case 1 is an abnormal impulse conduction from the leminiscus lateralis to the central trigeminus pathway and, in the other cases, a disturbance in the central sensory modulation. All patients developed in the further course a clinically definite MS. Having excluded peripheral causes for a hyperacusis, such as, e.g., an idiopathic facial nerve palsy or myasthenia gravis, one should always consider the possibility of MS in a case of central phonophobia.

Although loss of cerebrospinal fluid seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of this complication, the detailed mechanism of remote cerebellar hemorrhage after spinal surgery remains unclear. We report the case of a patient with remote cerebellar hemorrhage following thoracic spinal surgery of an intradural extramedullary tumor and discuss this entity with reference to the literature. A 57-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital with back pain, dysuria, and numbness of both legs. A neurological examination was performed, and imaging was performed with ordinary radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an intradural extramedullary tumor at the T3 level. A tumor resection and T1-T5 pedicle screw fixation were performed. Twelve hours after spinal surgery, she complained of unexpected dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. A total of 850 mL of serosanguineous fluid had been drained at that time, and drainage was stopped. An urgent brain computed tomography scan showed a cerebellar hemorrhage. She was treated conservatively, and was able to leave hospital six weeks after the initial operation, without any neurological deficits except for slight ataxia. Remote cerebellar hemorrhage has to be suspected when unexpected neurological signs occur after spinal surgery. If an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid drains from the drainage tube after spinal surgery, drainage should be stopped.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-015-0541-8,PMC4378378,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

They can occur due to extravascular extension or intravascular seeding of the vessel wall. They often result in subarachnoid hemorrhage with poor prognosis. We present a rare case of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to vertebral artery dissection with aproximal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA)-posterior inferior cerebellar artery common trunk mycotic aneurysm after an episode of bacterial meningitis. A 66-year-old male with history of 2 episodes of culture-negative bacterial meningitis presented with a Hunt and Hess grade II, Fisher grade III subarachnoid hemorrhage. Catheter angiography showed a right-sided intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection and a fusiform AICA-posterior inferior cerebellar artery trunk aneurysm. The patient underwent an endovascular occlusion of the VA dissecting aneurysm followed by an occipital artery to AICA bypass with trapping of the aneurysm. The patient developed a left-sided numbness and weakness after the coiling procedure due to anteromedian medullary stroke (occlusion of the right anterior spinal artery). The patient's magnetic resonance imaging 3 weeks before the aneurysm rupture and during the second episode of meningitis showed new enhancement of both vertebral arteries with a mild reduction in the right VA caliber. At 6 weeks' follow-up the patient was off the ventilator but had a modified Rankin Scale score of 5. Bacterial meningitis can lead to inflammatory injury of the intracranial vessels with resultant aneurysm formation. New enhancement of the vessel wall indicates that patients are at risk of developing mycotic aneurysms; therefore close observation with repeated vascular imaging is necessary.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.090,,Aneurysm; Artery; Bypass; Dissection; Infarction; Meningitis; Vertebral,Case Reports,United States,eng

A 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and Neurophysiological Case Study.,"Toscano, Massimiliano; Ricci, Maria; Celletti, Claudia; Paoloni, Marco; Ruggiero, Marco; Viganò, Alessandro; Jannini, Tommaso B; Altarocca, Alberto; Liberatore, Mauro; Camerota, Filippo; Di Piero, Vittorio",Toscano,"Focal repetitive muscle vibration (fMV) is a safe and well-tolerated non-invasive brain and peripheral stimulation (NIBS) technique, easy to perform at the bedside, and able to promote the post-stroke motor recovery through conditioning the stroke-related dysfunctional structures and pathways. Here we describe the concurrent cortical and spinal plasticity induced by fMV in a chronic stroke survivor, as assessed with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, peripheral nerve stimulation, and gait analysis. A 72-years-old patient was referred to our stroke clinic for a right leg hemiparesis and spasticity resulting from a previous (4 years before) hemorrhagic stroke. He reported a subjective improvement of his right leg's spasticity and dysesthesia that occurred after a30-min ride on a <i>Vespa</i> scooter as a passenger over the Roman Sampietrini (i.e., cubic-shaped cobblestones). Taking into account both the patient's anecdote and the current guidelines that recommend fMV for the treatment of post-stroke spasticity, we then decided to start fMV treatment. 12 fMV sessions (frequency 100 Hz; amplitude range 0.2-0.5 mm, three 10-min daily sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks) were applied over the quadriceps femoris, triceps surae, and hamstring muscles through a specific commercial device (Cro®System, NEMOCOsrl). A standardized clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (T0) the first fMV session and after (T1) the last one. After fMV treatment, we observed a clinically relevant motor and functional improvement, as assessed by comparing the post-treatment changes in the score of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, the Motricity Index score, the gait analysis, and the Ashworth modified scale, with the respective minimal detectable change at the 95% confidence level (MDC<sub>95</sub>). Data from SPECT and peripheral nerve stimulation supported the evidence of a concurrent brain and spinal plasticity promoted by fMV treatment trough activity-dependent changes in cortical perfusion and motoneuron excitability, respectively. In conclusion, the substrate of post-stroke motor recovery induced by fMV involves a concurrently acting multisite plasticity (i.e., cortical and spinal plasticity). In our patient, operant conditioning of both cortical perfusion and motoneuron excitability throughout a month of fMV treatment was related to a clinically relevant improvement in his strength, step symmetry (with reduced limping), and spasticity.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.567833,PMC7705992,brain plasticity; focal muscle vibration; motor recovery; spinal cord plasticity; stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
10567815,Aggravation of poststroke sensory symptoms after a second stroke on the opposite side.,"Kim, J S",Kim,"The role of the ipsilateral hemisphere in sensory functions remains unknown. The author describes 5 patients who presented with hemisensory symptoms due to unilateral strokes occurring in the left putamen, left thalamus, right putamen, right lateral medulla and left thalamic-internal capsular area, respectively. Sensory symptoms had gradually improved or remained stable after the initial events. However, when another stroke occurred on the contralateral thalamic-occipital, frontoparietal, lateral medulla, temporoparietal and pontine areas, respectively, previous sensory symptoms significantly worsened and became painful. These observations suggest that ipsilateral sensory pathways play a role in the modulation of sensory functions.",{},,European neurology,10.1159/000008107,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
9272783,A longitudinal study of somesthetic perceptual disorders in an individual with a unilateral thalamic lesion.,"Greenspan, J D; Joy, S E; McGillis, S L; Checkosky, C M; Bolanowski, S J",Greenspan,"Several aspects of tactile, thermal and pain perception were evaluated in an individual (R.S.) with a hemorrhagic lesion centered in her left lateral thalamus. Over a 4-year period, psychophysical evaluations were undertaken every 6-8 months, and five magnetic resonance (MR) studies were conducted. Early tests (1991-1992) revealed large contralateral deficits in R.S.'s perception of touch, innocuous temperature, and mechanically evoked cutaneous pain--more so for the upper versus the lower extremity. R.S. showed a similar pattern for heat pain sensitivity, but a more modest deficit than for mechanically evoked pain. She showed a deficit for cold pain sensitivity on her foot, but not for her hand. Thresholds for all types of stimuli ipsilateral to the lesion were within a normative range. Late in 1993, R.S. demonstrated improvements in sensory capacity for touch and mechanically evoked pain contralaterally, although deficits were still evident. During the same period, heat pain sensitivity improved contralaterally, and strikingly, a permanent, ipsilateral hypersensitivity to heat pain developed in her hand. Throughout the entire testing period, R.S.'s ratings of perceived unpleasantness matched the patterns of perceived pain intensity. Thus, the discriminative and the affective dimensions of her pain would change in tandem. However, perceptible innocuous thermal stimuli evoked no affective response when applied contralaterally, despite being described as pleasant when presented ipsilaterally. Throughout the testing period, R.S. reported a persistent numbness on her right hemi-body. Only during a 3-month period in 1995 did she experience spontaneous pain, which was referred to her right foot. The only change in psychophysical performance related to her right foot was a transient but intense thermal allodynia several months prior to her spontaneous pain. The MR studies over this 4-year period showed changes in the extent of edema, gliosis and/or ischemia that could be related to perceptual changes. Thus, the conspicuous observations in this thalamic lesion case were: (i) differential effects upon the various pain modalities (mechanical, heat and cold); (ii) development of thermal allodynia without mechanical allodynia, including an ipsilateral effect; (iii) a deficit in positive affective responses to temperature; and (iv) the different time courses for changes in evoked somesthetic capacity versus spontaneous paresthesias and pathological pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/s0304-3959(97)03378-2,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

29137102,Lateral medullary infarction with similar features of Brown Sequard syndrome caused by vertebrobasilar dysplasia and Klippel-Feil syndrome: A case report.,"Han, Jingzhe; Cao, Duanhua; Ma, Guomei; Wang, Tingting; Ji, Ye; Kang, Zhilei",Han,"Patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) are always anomaly associated with vertebrobasilar dysplasia. That may present commonly as infarction of brainstem, medulla, and cerebellum. In this article, we reported a rare case of lateral medullary infarction (LMI) with similar features of Brown Sequard syndrome caused by vertebrobasilar dysplasia and KFS, and the 2 rare conditions that are causally related. The case is being reported because of its unusual and rare presentation. A 38-year-old female presented with acute unsteadiness, along with a tendency to lean to the left side while walking or sitting, and paresthesia in the right lower limb and trunk, at 2 days before admission. She had no history of hypertension and diabetes, but had a 20 years history of neck pain and dizziness, which was related to head movement. Brown Sequard syndrome and a lesion of the left thoracic spinal cord were suspected initially. KFS was confirmed by the cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) results. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) results confirmed that there was a causal link between LMI and KFS. The patient rejected the operation of stabilization of the cervical spine with fusion at appropriate levels. No recurrence of stroke, but neck pain and dizziness remained after 6 months of discharge. For such patients, the conventional treatment of cerebral infarction might be ineffective, but stabilization of the cervical spine with fusion at appropriate levels can successfully prevent further episodes of syncope and stroke.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000008647,PMC5690795,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
35032997,A patient with granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris survived with two excisions and medication.,"Peng, Limei; Zhou, Quan; Wu, Yu; Cao, Xiaoli; Lv, Zili; Su, Minghua; Yu, Yachun; Huang, Wen",Peng,"Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) is a rare central nervous system infection caused by the Balamuthia mandrillaris or Acanthamoeba species. Diagnosis is challenging because of the non-specific clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and radiological features. There is no effective treatment for GAE to date. A 54-year-old male was admitted to hospital after experiencing acute onset of numbness and weakness on his left limb. Due to the initial consideration of intracranial tumor, surgical removal of the right parietal lesion was performed. However, the patient had a headache accompanied by diplopia, difficulty walking and a new lesion was found in the left occipital-parietal lobe two weeks after the first operation. High-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) detected the presence of high copy reads of the B. mandrillaris genome sequence in the patient's blood, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and brain tissue. Pathological investigation of the brain tissue showed granulomatous changes and amoebic trophozoite scattered around blood vessels under high magnification. The patient was re-operated due to developing progressive confusion caused by subfalcine herniation of the left cerebral hemisphere. The lesions of the right parietal lobe were obviously decreasing in size after the first surgery, and the lesions of the left occipital lobe and the sunfalcine herniation didn't ameliorate two months after the second surgery. The patient was transferred to local hospital for continuous treatment with sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin. After five months of the second surgery, the patient showed good recovery with mild headache. This is the first report of a patient with B. mandrillaris encephalitis initially confirmed by NGS and have experienced two excisions, responding favorably to the combination of surgeries and medications. Early surgical resection of intracranial lesions combined with drug treatment may offer the chance of a cure.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC infectious diseases,10.1186/s12879-021-07020-8,PMC8760828,Balamuthia mandrillaris; Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis; High-throughput next-generation sequencing; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

7631085,Chronic motor cortex stimulation for central deafferentation pain: experience with bulbar pain secondary to Wallenberg syndrome.,"Katayama, Y; Tsubokawa, T; Yamamoto, T",Katayama,"Six patients with bulbar pain caused by lateral medullary infarct were treated by stimulation therapy. Dysesthesia on the opposite side of the body was subjected to stimulation therapy in these patients. Of the subjects, 4 underwent thalamic stimulation and 3 were treated by motor cortex stimulation; the effects of both thalamic and motor cortex stimulation were investigated in 1 patient. No satisfactory pain control was obtained by thalamic stimulation in any of the patients in this series. In contrast, 2 of the 3 patients treated by motor cortex stimulation reported satisfactory pain control. The pain inhibition usually occurred at intensities below the threshold for the production of muscle contraction (pulse duration, 0.1-0.5 ms; intensity, 3-8 V). This finding was consistent with our previous observations made in a series of patients with thalamic pain, indicating that motor cortex stimulation is significantly more useful than thalamic stimulation for controlling deafferentation pain secondary to central nervous system lesions. We discuss the possibility that better control of deafferentation pain may be provided by stimulation at a level more rostral to the site of deafferentation.",{},,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000098635,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

A 62-year-old man developed acute heat anesthesia and deep sensory disturbance in the right half of his body, but sensation for cold and pain was preserved. The resolution of these symptoms was accompanied by the gradual development of central dysesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) findings showed a small infarction in the left thalamic principal somatosensory nucleus (ventral caudal) and pulvinar. Single-photon emission CT showed hypoperfusion in the mid-cingulate cortex (mid-CC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), however, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices were spared. Somatosensory-evoked potential findings were normal. The disruption of spinothalamocortical projection to the mid-CC and SMA is attributable to the development of central dysesthesia in the present case.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2009.03.012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
