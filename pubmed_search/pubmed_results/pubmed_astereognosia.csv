34694463,Isolated post-traumatic astereognosis: a case-based review.,"Khormi, Yahya H; Atteya, Mostafa M E",Khormi,"Astereognosis is the tactile inability to recognize objects placed in the palms by touch with the eyes closed or blind-folded in the presence of intact primary sensory modalities. Stereognosis is usually considered a function of the contralateral sensory cerebral cortex. However, lesions of several anatomic areas and pathologic entities have been reported to be associated with astereognosis. Only two previous reports linked traumatic injury to isolated astereognosis: following surgical evacuation of traumatic parietal extradural hematoma and following bullet injury in the neck in 1992 and 1919, respectively. All the pertinent literature was analyzed, focusing on the relevant definitions, clinical spectra, pathoanatomical processes, assessment, management, and outcomes of astereognosis. Also, an illustrative case was presented. The case highlights isolated post-traumatic left hand astereognosis in a 17-year-old boy following a blunt trauma to the head which resulted in a non-hemorrhagic contusion of the right post-central gyrus. Post-traumatic isolated astereognosis is a rare and probably underreported sequel of traumatic brain injury. Neurosurgeons need to be more sensitive to the assessment and detection of subtle stereognostic deficits in general and in trauma patients in particular. Other anatomical areas, in addition to the contralateral post-central gyrus, may be considered in the pathogenesis of astereognosis with the involvement of the dorsal column medial lemniscus tract such as the brainstem, foramen magnum, and the cervical spinal cord. To the best of our knowledge, this rare case report is considered the second report on astereognosis following head trauma, and the third report on astereognosis following trauma in general.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,10.1007/s00381-021-05392-5,,Astereognosis; Morphognosia; Post-central gyrus; Stereoanesthesia; Tactile agnosia; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

It is a clinical presentation of bitemporal disorders with limbic system abnormalities. The most common cause of KBS is herpes encephalitis. An otherwise healthy 61-year-old woman presented with mental status changes (MMSE-0) after 6 days of severe vomiting. Extracellular dehydration, hyponatremia (107 mmol/L), low levels of natriuresis, and mild hypokalemia were noted. The initial computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal. Over 36 hours of hospitalization in a district hospital she developed unusual neuropsychiatric disorders: hypersexuality, hyperorality, absence, visual agnosia, sensory aphasia, amnesia, and depression typical of KBS. She was then transferred to a neurology department. Clear improvement was visible 3 months later: MMSE-22, moderation of hypersexuality and hyperorality, partial correction of amnesia and aphasia, regression of visual agnosia. But the prosopagnosia (face blindness) persisted, and the patient remained unable to differentiate positive and negative facial expressions. Intracranial mass, epilepsy, neuromeningeal infection and head trauma were all ruled out. Antiepileptic and antiherpetic agents were tested without success. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or inappropriate vasopressin secretion. Only severe vomiting, corrected by water intake, could explain the hyponatremia. The first MRI showed bitemporal edema; 3 months later it showed large bitemporal lesions, both internal and external, with atrophy of the hippocampus and limbic system. These MRI findings are characteristic of KBS.

Her basic somatosensory functions were normal. The appreciation of substance qualities (hylognosia) was preserved, but the patient's inability to recognize the size and shape (morphagnosia) was confined to 2- and 3-dimensional shapes (amorphagnosia) in the left hand. However, the patient's ability to recognize real daily objects was well preserved. Brain MRI after admission showed ischemic lesions confined to the right pre- and postcentral gyri and the medial frontal cortex on DWI and FLAIR images. An analysis of SPECT images revealed that the most decreased areas were localized to the pre- and postcentral gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Considering the previous reported cases, the responsible lesion for the impaired perception of hylognosia and morphagnosia may not necessarily be confined to the right hemisphere. To date, 5 reports (6 cases) of tactile agnosia have been published; 4 cases presented with both ahylognosia and amorphagnosia, while 1 presented with only amorphagnosia, and another showed amorphagnosia and mild ahylognosia. Our case is the first to present with only amorphagnosia without tactile agnosia. The mechanism for the well-preserved recognition of real objects may depend on the preserved hylognosia.

The clinical picture following the acute phase of disease was dominated by severe fluent aphasia, prominent oral tendencies, visual agnosia, and a decrease in fear reactions. Most of these symptoms, with the obvious exception of aphasia, are similar to those observed by Kluver and Bucy in rhesus monkeys that underwent bitemporal lobectomy. These manifestations may be explained by the tendency of the herpes simplex virus to invade the temporal lobes. ""Agnosia"" in the auditory field and changes in vocal behavior were observed by H. Kluver and P. C. Bucy (1939, Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, 42, 949-1000) in some of their bitemporal monkeys.

25046697,Pure associative tactile agnosia for the left hand: clinical and anatomo-functional correlations.,"Veronelli, Laura; Ginex, Valeria; Dinacci, Daria; Cappa, Stefano F; Corbo, Massimo",Veronelli,"Associative tactile agnosia (TA) is defined as the inability to associate information about object sensory properties derived through tactile modality with previously acquired knowledge about object identity. The impairment is often described after a lesion involving the parietal cortex (Caselli, 1997; Platz, 1996). We report the case of SA, a right-handed 61-year-old man affected by first ever right hemispheric hemorrhagic stroke. The neurological examination was normal, excluding major somaesthetic and motor impairment; a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a right subacute hemorrhagic lesion limited to the post-central and supra-marginal gyri. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation detected a selective inability to name objects when handled with the left hand in the absence of other cognitive deficits. A series of experiments were conducted in order to assess each stage of tactile recognition processing using the same stimulus sets: materials, 3D geometrical shapes, real objects and letters. SA and seven matched controls underwent the same experimental tasks during four sessions in consecutive days. Tactile discrimination, recognition, pantomime, drawing after haptic exploration out of vision and tactile-visual matching abilities were assessed. In addition, we looked for the presence of a supra-modal impairment of spatial perception and of specific difficulties in programming exploratory movements during recognition. Tactile discrimination was intact for all the stimuli tested. In contrast, SA was able neither to recognize nor to pantomime real objects manipulated with the left hand out of vision, while he identified them with the right hand without hesitations. Tactile-visual matching was intact. Furthermore, SA was able to grossly reproduce the global shape in drawings but failed to extract details of objects after left-hand manipulation, and he could not identify objects after looking at his own drawings. This case confirms the existence of selective associative TA as a left hand-specific deficit in recognizing objects. This deficit is not related to spatial perception or to the programming of exploratory movements. The cross-modal transfer of information via visual perception permits the activation of a partially degraded image, which alone does not allow the proper recognition of the initial tactile stimulus.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.06.015,,Apraxia; Cross-modal transfer; Parietal lobe; Somatosensory perception; Tactile agnosia; Tactile object recognition,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

In 1906, Hermann Oppenheim reported a patient with bilateral stereoagnosia (astereognosis) caused by a left parietal lobe tumor and proposed that the left hemisphere was also dominant for stereognosis. Surprisingly, few cases of bilateral stereoagnosia caused by a unilateral cerebral lesion have been documented in the literature since then. Here we report a 75-year-old right-handed man who developed bilateral stereoagnosia after suffering a small infarct in the crown of the left postcentral gyrus. He could not recognize objects with either hand, but retained the ability to localize stimuli applied to the palm of his left (ipsilesional) hand. He was severely disabled in ordinary activities requiring the use of his hands. The lesion corresponded to Brodmann area 1, where probabilistic anatomic, functional, and electrophysiologic studies have located one of the multiple somatosensory representations of the hand. The lesion was in a strategic position to interrupt both the processing of afferent tactile information issuing from the primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a and 3b) and the forward higher-order processing in area 2, the secondary sensory cortex, and the contralateral area 1. The lesion also deprived the motor hand area of its afferent regulation from the sensory hand area (grasping), while leaving intact the visuomotor projections from the occipital cortex (reaching). Our patient supports Oppenheim's proposal that the left postcentral gyrus of some individuals is dominant for stereognosis.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000135,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

3344627,Astereognosis as a presenting symptom in cervical meningioma.,"Weidenfeld, J; Finkelstein, Y; Bental, E",Weidenfeld,"Three unusual cases with astereognosis caused by cervical meningioma are presented. Astereognosis of subcortical origin has been reported several times. According to these reports, the causative lesion was confined to the area extending between the lower brain stem and the fourth cervical vertebra, thus suggesting that a sensory centre for stereognosis could be confined within these well defined anatomical limits, and that therefore a lesion in this area could lead to astereognosis. It is assumed in this paper that the lesion involves the sensory system of the Nucleus Cervicalis Lateralis. Fibres from the spinothalamic tract, a specialized sensory pathway, ascend from the palms of the hands to this nucleus. From this nucleus arise fibres which decussate and reach the Ventral Posterolateral Nucleus of the thalamus. It is likely that a lesion of the nucleus itself or its related sensory tracts may cause astereognosis.",{},,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/BF01541269,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

These episodes included hypersexuality with qualitative changes of sex drive, obscene behavior, exhibitionism, masturbation and modified sexual orientation. Blunted affect, inability to recognize significant persons (visual agnosia) were also detected. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed decreased cerebral perfusion in both temporal lobes. The principal hypothesis is a Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS). In animals and human beings, this syndrome can be produced by bilateral temporal lobectomy. It is characterised by hypersexuality, visual agnosia, strong oral tendency, dietary changes, hypermetamorphosis and blunted affect. A minimum of three KBS elements suggests bilateral temporal dysfunction and supports the diagnosis. The syndrome may occur in herpes encephalitis, head trauma, Pick disease and temporal epilepsy. A single case of a patient, without any evidence for structural lesion in temporal lobes, is presented with many KBS symptoms, behavioral changes being due to complex partial seizure. Bitemporal dysfunction for this patient was confirmed by SPECT scan. On the other hand, the detected behavioral changes cannot be explained by temporal epilepsy alone. Postictal hypersexuality in temporal epilepsy consists in sexual arousal but not sexual aberrations as found in KBS. KBS following complex partial status epilepticus is a rare phenomenum. The case described here shows how atypical psychiatric episodes can cover complex neurologic disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,L'Encephale,10.1016/j.encep.2008.06.013,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

In an attempt to determine whether there is also evidence of serial processing in humans 10 patients with parietal cortical lesions, three patients with subcortical lesions and one patient after hemispherectomy, were examined. Case-by-case and across subject analysis of lesion type, sensorimotor profile and electrophysiological findings showed that in unihemispheric lesions: (a) there is little impairment of thermesthesia, nociception and vibration sense: (b) two-point discrimination and integrity of the N20 somatosensory component are highly correlated; (c) a loss of the N20 component is accompanied by a severe impairment of stereognosis; (d) conversely, in more posterior lesions astereognosis can occur with an intact N20 component; and (e) if the lesion is in the right hemisphere there is frequently impairment of graphesthesia in both hands. These data are taken to indicate serial processing from SI (as evidenced by an intact N20 component) to posterior parietal cortex allowing progressive spatial and temporal integration. In graphesthesia our data suggest an integrative function of the right parietal cortex for both sides of the body. Other sensory qualities like vibration nociception and thermesthesia are apparently processed in a non-serial, probably parallel way involving both hemispheres. The effects of cerebral lesions in our series suggest parallel as well as serial processing of somesthetic information in man underlying the perception of different haptic features.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(95)00148-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without tactile agnosia, i.e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognition.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.11.2287,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The procedure is demonstrated in three patients suffering from aperceptive tactile agnosia of the right hand due to chronic infarction of the left parietal cortex. Patient 1 presents a lesion in areas of the postcentral sulcus, Patient 3 in areas of the superior parietal lobule and adjacent intraparietal sulcus, and Patient 2 lesions in both regions. On the basis of neurobehavioral data, we conjectured degradation of sequential elementary sensory information processing within the postcentral gyrus, impeding texture recognition in Patients 1 and 2, and disturbed kinaesthetic information processing in the posterior parietal lobe, causing degraded shape recognition in the patients 2 and 3. The involvement of Brodmann areas 4a, 4p, 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and areas IP1 and IP2 of the intraparietal sulcus was assessed in terms of the voxel overlap between the spatially transformed lesion masks and the 50%-isocontours of the cytoarchitectonic maps. The disruption of the critical cytoarchitectonic areas and the impaired subfunctions, texture and shape recognition, relate as conjectured above. We conclude that the proposed method represents a promising approach to hypothesis-driven lesion analyses, yielding lesion-function correlates based on a cytoarchitectonic model. Finally, the lesion-function correlates are validated by functional imaging reference data.",{},,Human brain mapping,10.1002/hbm.20617,PMC6870829,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient had been diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis three years prior to admission. He noticed difficulty in manipulating objects three months before admission. Cervical T2-weighted MRI showed a high signal intensity at the level of C3-4 which was enhanced on T1-weighted image with gadolinium. On admission, neurological examinations revealed impairment of dexterity, deep sensory disturbance, and astereognosis in both hands. The clumsiness of complex finger movements was predominant on the left side, and was exaggerated with the eyes closed in association with pseudoathetosis. After steroid therapy, his clumsy hands improved gradually. This type of clumsiness in multiple sclerosis had been described as useless hand syndrome by Oppenheim. In accordance with our case, useless hand syndrome has been reported to arise from high cervical (C2-4) lesions, mainly involving the posterior cord ipsilateral to the clumsy hand. Although the majority of reported cases with useless hand syndrome had other neurological complications, such as hemiparesis, tetraparesis, and truncal ataxia, our patient exhibited a pure form of useless hand syndrome. In addition, useless hand syndrome is usually unilateral, and bilateral useless hand syndrome is very rare. Clumsiness of fine finger movements with astereognosis in our patient is similar to numb clumsy hands or limb-kinetic apraxia due to cervical spondylosis or postcentral gyrus lesion, respectively. This indicates an important role of the high cervical posterior cord in conveying a kinesthetic sense necessary to guide fine finger movements.

Tactile agnosia was present in both hands, as shown by his impaired recognition of objects, geometrical shapes, letters and nonsense shapes. Basic somatosensory functions and the appreciation of substance qualities (hylognosis) were preserved. The patient's inability to identify the stimulus shape (morphagnosia) was associated with a striking impairment in detecting the orientation of a line or a rod in two- and three-dimensional space. This spatial deficit was thought to underlie morphagnosia, since in the tactile modality form recognition is built upon the integration of the successive changes of orientation in space made by the hand as it explores the stimulus. Indirect support for this hypothesis was provided by the location of the lesions, which could not account for the severe impairment of both hands. Only those located in the right hemisphere encroached upon the posterior parietal cortex, which is the region assumed to be specialised in shape recognition. The left hemisphere damage spared the corresponding area and could not, therefore, be held responsible for the right hand tactile agnosia. We submit that tactile agnosia can result from the disruption of two discrete mechanisms and has different features. It may arise from a parietal lesion damaging the high level processing of somatosensory information that culminates in the structured description of the object. In this case, tactile recognition is impaired in the hand contralateral to the side of the lesion. Alternatively, it may be caused by a profound derangement of spatial skills, particularly those involved in detecting the orientation in space of lines, segments and complex patterns. This deficit results in morphagnosia, which affects both hands to the same degree.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(98)00157-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
223793,Tumours at the spinocranial junction: some clinical and electromyographic aspects in relation to the symptomatology.,"Frenay, J J; Groen, J J; Endtz, L J",Frenay,"On the basis of six cases of a tumour at the spinocranial junction, the clinical symptomatology is discussed with special reference to the occurrence of astereognosis and amyotrophy of the hand muscles. Possible mechanisms underlying these symptoms are discussed. In the authors' opinion, the frequent association of these symptoms is explained by the association of two pathogenic mechanisms, i.e., compression of the posterior column or interference with the arterial blood flow to the medial lemniscus, leading to astereognosis, and interference with the venous blood flow, leading to amyotrophy of the hand muscles.",{},,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/s0303-8467(79)80003-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
20183549,To lose the frame of action: a selective deficit in avoiding unpleasant objects following a unilateral temporal lobe lesion.,"Bamford, Susan; Turnbull, Oliver H; Coetzer, Rudi; Ward, Robert",Bamford,"Studies on emotion and its neurobiology have been far more focused on the recognition of emotion than on actions that are caused by emotional states. We investigate the performance of a patient, HS, with a unilateral lesion to the left temporal pole and orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) (including left amygdala), on a well-established approach/avoid task that taps into emotion-driven action. The striking finding of the present study is a remarkable, and selective, slowing of HS's avoidance of unpleasant items in her (impaired) contralesional field. This finding suggests that the left temporal lobe and OFC structures, including the amygdala, appear to be involved in the action component of emotion, specifically in avoiding negative items.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802680313,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
12080614,[Successful treatment of emotional disturbances following non-herpetic limbic encephalitis by serotonergic agents. A case report].,"Narikawa, K; Hasegawa, T; Takeda, A; Shiga, Y; Itoyama, Y",Narikawa,"We report a 19-year-old woman who developed refractory status epilepticus due to non-herpetic limbic encephalitis. Because ordinary anti-epileptics were ineffective, general anesthesia under mechanical ventilation was begun with pentobarbital, midazolam, and propofol. After 4 months, we could finally discontinue the intravenous anesthetics. Then, she gradually became conscious and several weeks later, could communicate verbally. Simultaneously, she began to manifest psychomotor agitation and emotional incontinence mimicking Klüver-Bucy syndrome. Brain MRI revealed cortical atrophy in the fronto-temporal lobes and dilated anterior and inferior horns of the lateral ventricles. Dopamine blockers and benzodiazepines failed to resolve these emotional symptoms. Oral tandospirone (30 mg/day dose) was initiated and a partial regression was observed. The following administration of fluvoxamine (started with 12.5 mg/day and maintained with 75 mg/day) resulted in a dramatic improvement of her symptoms within 3 days. This clinical course suggests that impaired serotonergic neurotransmission plays a key role in her emotional disturbances and that its modulation by serotonergic agents is useful to relieve such symptoms.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

9339337,"Sniffing behaviour, or recognizing a lily by smell, but not recognizing a sock on sight.","Vuilleumier, P; Staub, F; Assal, G",Vuilleumier,"We report a 65-year-old man with a post-anoxic encephalopathy who showed compulsive sniffing at available objects. This stereotyped environment-driven behaviour has not been previously described. Other compulsive environment-driven responses, such as manipulation and utilization of tools and hyperlexia, were also present. The disorder shared several features with the Klüver-Bucy syndrome where mouthing of objects, rather than smelling them, is common. The patient had a severe dementia, with amnesia, anomia, apraxia, and visual agnosia. Whereas he could not recognize very familiar objects on sight, he could in contrast correctly identify several familiar odours. Although sniffing was a compulsive and purposeless environment-driven behaviour, the question may be asked whether a relatively preserved olfactory recognition, in the presence of a severe disorder of visual recognition and knowledge, could have favoured a stereotyped exploration of objects by smelling.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70238-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
14582369,[Epstein-Barr virus-associated encephalitis presenting as refractory status epilepticus that persisted for nearly 2 months with excellent recovery].,"Nishie, Makoto; Ogawa, Masaya; Kurahashi, Kozo",Nishie,"A 37-year-old woman presented with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated encephalitis that developed into refractory status epilepticus ten days after the onset of headache and fever, without signs suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. An electroencephalogram showed definite epileptogenic changes, including diffuse slow wave bursts with paroxysmal generalized bilateral sharp waves. The patient required general anesthesia for nearly two months, but had completely improved 18 months later. The patient developed Klüver-Bucy syndrome four months after the onset: bilateral frontal hypoperfusion was detected with SPECT at this time, but also improved after 18 months. MRI showed a 2-3 mm lesion of the cerebellar white matter, which was suggestive of a small demyelinaed focus. The patient's serum was positive for EBV DNA within two weeks of onset, but negative there-after. However, the CSF was positive for EBV DNA for more than five months, with a four-fold increase in the titers of IgG antibody for EBV-viral capside antigen in the CSF. Given the patient's good recovery from her critical condition, her severe encephalitis/encephalopathy with persistent status epilepticus probably resulted from an EBV-associated immune-response after the reactivation of EBV, rather than from a direct infiltration of EBV into the brain.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
