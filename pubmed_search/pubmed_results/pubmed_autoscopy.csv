27178238,Out-of-Body Experience During Awake Craniotomy.,"Bos, Eelke M; Spoor, Jochem K H; Smits, Marion; Schouten, Joost W; Vincent, Arnaud J P E",Bos,"The out-of-body experience (OBE), during which a person feels as if he or she is spatially removed from the physical body, is a mystical phenomenon because of its association with near-death experiences. Literature implicates the cortex at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) as the possible anatomic substrate for OBE. We present a patient who had an out-of-body experience during an awake craniotomy for resection of low-grade glioma. During surgery, stimulation of subcortical white matter in the left TPJ repetitively induced OBEs, in which the patient felt as if she was floating above the operating table looking down on herself. We repetitively induced OBE by subcortical stimulation near the left TPJ during awake craniotomy. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography implicated the posterior thalamic radiation as a possible substrate for autoscopic phenomena.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.002,,Autoscopy; Awake craniotomy; Diffusion tensor imaging; Low-grade glioma; Out-of-body experience; Posterior thalamic radiation; Temporoparietal junction,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
8768680,[Autoscopy and multiple sclerosis].,"Arias, M; Bouzón, J L; Requena, I; Lema, C; Ecenarro, P; Pereiro, I; Ventura, M",Arias,"A female patient with clinically defined multiple sclerosis presented episodes of audiovisual hallucinations in the form of projections of her own body image speaking to her. EEG and EEG-Holter studies were normal. MRI revealed multiple areas of hypersignals in white matter, particularly in both temporal lobes. The episodes remitted with carbamazepine therapy. We postulate that this phenomenon of autoscopy, which is unusual in multiple sclerosis, may be related to a mechanism of ephaptic transmission in the temporal lobe that is inhibited by carbamazepine, or it may be related to seizure.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
2679507,Autoscopic phenomena with seizures.,"Devinsky, O; Feldmann, E; Burrowes, K; Bromfield, E",Devinsky,"We report the cases of 10 patients with seizures and autoscopic phenomena, which include seeing one's double and out-of-body experiences, and review 33 additional cases of autoscopic seizures from the literature. Autoscopic phenomena may be symptoms of simple partial, complex partial, or generalized tonoclonic seizures. Autoscopic seizures may be more common than is recognized; we found a 6.3% incidence in the patients we interviewed. The temporal lobe was involved in 18 (86%) of the 21 patients in whom the seizure focus could be identified. There was no clear lateralization of lesions in patients with ictal autoscopy. The response of autoscopic episodes to treatment usually paralleled that of the underlying seizure disorder. Autoscopic phenomena are likely to be discovered only on specific questioning of patients with epilepsy and may be an important, distressing feature of a chronic seizure disorder.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1989.00520460060015,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
14662516,Out-of-body experience and autoscopy of neurological origin.,"Blanke, Olaf; Landis, Theodor; Spinelli, Laurent; Seeck, Margitta",Blanke,"During an out-of-body experience (OBE), the experient seems to be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical body. A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh040,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
34522516,Astral Projection: A Strange Out-of-Body Experience in Dissociative Disorder.,"Mudgal, Varchasvi; Dhakad, Rashmi; Mathur, Rahul; Sardesai, Ujwal; Pal, Virendra",Mudgal,"Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are hallucinatory visual experiences that involve seeing the physical body placed in an external visual space. Many psychiatric disorders, brain dysfunctions, pharmacological agents, and altered psychological states are reportedly associated with these phenomena. OBEs have been linked to various brain lesions, particularly in the parietal and temporal regions, psychiatric disorders, severe emotional states like a near-death experience, substance use, migraine, and epilepsy, but very few have been reported in dissociative identity disorder. In this report, we present the case of a 15-year-old male patient who described a strange experience where he found himself to be floating outside his own body while he visualized his own body from a third-person perspective. On further evaluation, a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative fugue was formulated. The patient showed improvement after undergoing abreaction, hypnosis, and relaxation training along with supportive psychotherapy. Dissociative disorders occur due to an internal conflict between ego and self, when a person is unable to successfully repress a traumatic experience, or when a repressed memory or experience comes out of the cocooned barrier, leading to an altered state of perception and self-experience, which is described by the patient as OBE. This report presents a scarce differential in the context of psychiatric illness, which might be helpful in the formulation of approaches toward management in cases of such OBE, making it a strange yet intriguing addition to the literature.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.17037,PMC8425774,astral projection; dissociative disorder; dissociative fugue; dissociative identity disorder; out of body experience,Case Reports,United States,eng
16006344,"""Seeing oneself"": a case of autoscopy.","Zamboni, Giovanna; Budriesi, Carla; Nichelli, Paolo",Zamboni,Autoscopy is the experience of seeing an image of one's body in external space. We describe the case of a patient who reported longstanding autoscopic hallucinations following post-eclamptic brain damage. The MR scan demonstrated damage involving the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia bilaterally. We hypothesize that the image was the result of aberrant plasticity mechanisms involving cortical areas that play a central role in high-order body or representation of oneself.,{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790590944799,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
20807051,"Spatial perspective and coordinate systems in autoscopy: a case report of a ""fantome de profil"" in occipital brain damage.","Bolognini, Nadia; Làdavas, Elisabetta; Farnè, Alessandro",Bolognini,"Autoscopic phenomena refer to complex experiences involving the illusory reduplication of one's own body. Here we report the third long-lasting case of autoscopy in a patient with right occipital lesion. Instead of the commonly reported frontal mirror view (fantôme spéculaire), the patient saw her head and upper trunk laterally in side view (fantôme de profil). We found that the visual appearance and completeness of the autoscopic image could be selectively modulated by active and passive movements, without being influenced by imagining the same movements or by tactile and auditory stimulation. Eyes closure did not disrupt either the perception of the autoscopic body or the effects of the motor stimulation. Moreover, the visual body reduplication was coded neither in purely eye-centered nor in head-centered frames of reference, suggesting the involvement of egocentric coordinate systems (eyes and head centered). A follow-up examination highlighted the stability of the visual characteristics of the body reduplication and its shift induced by displacement of both head and eyes. These findings support the view that autoscopic phenomena have a multisensory motor origin and proprioceptive signals may play an important role in modulating the illusory visual reduplication of the patient's own body, most likely via cross-modal modulation of extrastriate areas involved in body and face perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21569,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
24944263,Self-face hallucination evoked by electrical stimulation of the human brain.,"Jonas, Jacques; Maillard, Louis; Frismand, Solène; Colnat-Coulbois, Sophie; Vespignani, Hervé; Rossion, Bruno; Vignal, Jean-Pierre",Jonas,"Self-face hallucination (autoscopic hallucination or AH) has been reported in patients with widespread brain damage or retrospectively after epileptic seizures. The neural basis and the self-processing operations underlying AH remain unknown. We report the results of intracerebral electrical stimulations of the right medial occipitoparietal cortex (right precuneus and occipitoparietal sulcus) in 2 patients with epilepsy who underwent a stereo-EEG. Immediately after the onset of the stimulation, the 2 patients reported seeing their current own face, facing themselves, in their left visual field. Our study shows that the medial occipitoparietal junction has a key role in generating AH. This region has been shown to have a central role in various self-processing operations and especially in self-face recognition. Our observations further reveal that this region is involved in a visual representation of our own face, which is generated during the pathologic phenomenon of AH. This visual representation of our own face may be useful for self-face recognition and social cognition processes involving judgment of self-facial resemblance to others.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000000628,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
