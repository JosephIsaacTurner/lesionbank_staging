28513323,Modulation of somatoparaphrenia following left-hemisphere damage.,"D'Imperio, Daniela; Tomelleri, Giampaolo; Moretto, Giuseppe; Moro, Valentina",D'Imperio,"Somatoparaphrenic symptoms after left-hemisphere damage are rare. To verify the potential role of body-related sensory (proprioceptive, visual, and somatosensory) manipulation in patients experiencing sensations of hand disownership, the symptoms of a patient suffering from right-hand somatoparaphrenia were monitored and clinical and neuropsychological variables were controlled. Four types of manipulation were administered: changes in spatial position of the hand, multisensory stimulation, and self-observation using video or mirrors. Multisensory visuo-tactile stimulation was efficacious in terms of reducing somatoparaphrenia, and changes in the position of the hand produced some positive effects. Third-person perspective self-observation did not, however, result in any changes.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2017.1329444,,Disturbed sensation of limb ownership; Gertmann’s syndrome; body awareness; rehabilitation; somatoparaphrenia after a left-hemisphere lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35696732,Reach planning with someone else's hand.,"Rossi Sebastiano, Alice; Poles, Karol; Miller, Luke E; Fossataro, Carlotta; Milano, Edoardo; Gindri, Patrizia; Garbarini, Francesca",Rossi Sebastiano,"To investigate the relationship between the sense of body ownership and motor control, we capitalized on a rare bizarre disorder wherein another person's hand is misattributed to their own body, i.e., a pathological form of embodiment (E+). Importantly, despite E+ is usually associated with motor deficits, we had the opportunity to test two E+ patients with spared motor function, thus able to perform a reaching task. Crucially, these patients had proprioceptive deafferentation, allowing us to purely isolate the embodiment-dependent effect from proprioception-dependent ones that are usually associated in experimental manipulations of body ownership in healthy participants. Previous evidence suggests that the reaching movement vector is attracted towards an embodied hand during the rubber hand illusion (RHI). However, these results are confounded by the spared proprioception, whose modulation alone could explain the effects on reach planning. The neuropsychological approach employed here provides unambiguous evidence about the role of body ownership in reach planning. Indeed, three brain-damaged patients with proprioceptive deafferentation, two E+ and a well-matched control patient without pathological embodiment (E-), and 10 age-matched healthy controls underwent a reaching task wherein they had to reach for a target from a fixed starting point, while an alien hand (the co-experimenter's) was placed on the table. Irrespective of proprioception, damaged in all patients, only in E+ patients reaching errors were significantly more shifted consistently with the pathological belief, i.e., as if they planned movements from the position of the alien (embodied) hand, as compared to controls. Furthermore, with an additional experiment on healthy participants, we demonstrated that reaching errors observed during the RHI correlate with the changes in ownership. In conclusion, our neuropsychological approach suggests that when planning a reach, we do so from where our owned hand is and not from its physical location.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2022.05.005,,Body ownership; Motor planning; Pathological embodiment; Proprioception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
21969696,The role of self-touch in somatosensory and body representation disorders after stroke.,"van Stralen, H E; van Zandvoort, M J E; Dijkerman, H C",van Stralen,"Somatosensory impairments occur in about half of the cases of stroke. These impairments range from primary deficits in tactile detection and the perception of features, to higher order impairments in haptic object recognition and bodily experience. In this paper, we review the influence of active- and self-touch on somatosensory impairments after stroke. Studies have shown that self-touch improves tactile detection in patients with primary tactile deficits. A small number of studies concerned with the effect of self-touch on bodily experience in healthy individuals have demonstrated that self-touch influences the structural representation of one's own body. In order to better understand the effect of self-touch on body representations, we present an informal study of a stroke patient with somatoparaphrenia and misoplegia. The role of self-touch on body ownership was investigated by asking the patient to stroke the impaired left hand and foreign hands. The patient reported ownership and a change in affect over all presented hands through self-touch. The time it took to accomplish ownership varied, based on the resemblance of the foreign hand to the patient's own hand. Our findings suggest that self-touch can modulate impairments in body ownership and affect, perhaps by helping to reinstate the representation of the body.",{},,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

31194981,The dynamic nature of the sense of ownership after brain injury. Clues from asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.,"Romano, Daniele; Maravita, Angelo",Romano,"The sense of ownership is the feeling that a body part belongs to ourselves. Brain damage may disrupt this feeling, leading to somatoparaphrenia (SP), i.e., the delusion that one's limbs belong to someone else. This delusional feeling is typically associated with profound motor and somatosensory deficits. We reviewed the cases of SP reported so far in the literature outlining the clinical and neuroanatomical profile of SP. We then investigated and reported three new peculiar cases of SP that allow new insights into the theoretical framework of this neuropsychological condition. We thus propose an innovative theoretical account that integrates previous evidence and the new cases described. We suggest that a defective update of the ongoing dynamic representation of the body finalised to perception and action, may be the key for the disownership feelings of patients with SP. The erroneous spatial representation of the limb contralateral to the lesion would have the logical consequence of delusional misattribution of the seen own arm.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107119,,Body awareness; Body ownership; Body representation; Body schema; Right brain damage; Somatoparaphrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
36260096,Selective effects of a brain tumor on the metric representation of the hand: a pre- versus post-surgery comparison.,"Mora, Laura; Committeri, Giorgia; Ciavarro, Marco; Cocchini, Gianna",Mora,"Body representation disorders are complex, varied, striking, and very disabling in most cases. Deficits of body representation have been described after lesions to multimodal and sensorimotor cortical areas. A few studies have reported the effects of tumors on the representation of the body, but little is known about the changes after tumor resection. Moreover, the impact of brain lesions on the hand size representation has been investigated in few clinical cases. Hands are of special importance, as no other body part has the ability for movement and interaction with the environment that the hands have, and we use them for a multitude of daily activities. Studies with clinical population can add further knowledge into the way hands are represented. Here, we report a single case study of a patient (AM) who was an expert bodybuilder and underwent a surgery to remove a glioblastoma in the left posterior prefrontal and precentral cortex at the level of the hand's motor region. Pre- (20 days) and post- (4 months) surgery assessment did not show any motor or cognitive impairments. A hand localization task was used, before and after surgery (12 months), to measure possible changes of the metric representation of his right hand. Results showed a post-surgery modulation of the typically distorted hand representation, with an overall accuracy improvement, especially on width dimension. These findings support the direct involvement of sensorimotor areas in the implicit representation of the body size and its relevance on defining specific size representation dimensions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-022-06475-8,PMC9678987,Body representation; Brain tumor; Hand size; Localization task; Metric representation; Sensorimotor areas,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
14662516,Out-of-body experience and autoscopy of neurological origin.,"Blanke, Olaf; Landis, Theodor; Spinelli, Laurent; Seeck, Margitta",Blanke,"During an out-of-body experience (OBE), the experient seems to be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical body. A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh040,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
23603022,Body ownership and attention in the mirror: insights from somatoparaphrenia and the rubber hand illusion.,"Jenkinson, Paul M; Haggard, Patrick; Ferreira, Nicola C; Fotopoulou, Aikaterini",Jenkinson,"The brain receives and synthesises information about the body from different modalities, coordinates and perspectives, and affords us with a coherent and stable sense of body ownership. We studied this sense in a somatoparaphrenic patient and three control patients, all with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. We experimentally manipulated the visual perspective (direct- versus mirror-view) and spatial attention (drawn to peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space) in an experiment involving recognising one's own hand. The somatoparaphrenic patient denied limb ownership in all direct view trials, but viewing the hand via a mirror significantly increased ownership. The extent of this increase depended on spatial attention; when attention was drawn to the extrapersonal space (near-the-mirror) the patient showed a near perfect recognition of her arm in the mirror, while when attention was drawn to peripersonal space (near-the-body) the patient recognised her arm in only half the mirror trials. In a supplementary experiment, we used the Rubber Hand Illusion to manipulate the same factors in healthy controls. Ownership of the rubber hand occurred in both direct and mirror view, but shifting attention between peripersonal and extrapersonal space had no effect on rubber-hand ownership. We conclude that the isolation of visual perspectives on the body and the division of attention between two different locations is not sufficient to affect body ownership in healthy individuals and right hemisphere controls. However, in somatoparaphrenia, where first-person body ownership and stimulus-driven attention are impaired by lesions to a right-hemisphere ventral attentional-network, the body can nevertheless be recognised as one's own if perceived in a third-person visual perspective and particularly if top-down, spatial attention is directed away from peripersonal space.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.03.029,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
2004260,Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia.,"Sirigu, A; Grafman, J; Bressler, K; Sunderland, T",Sirigu,"Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/114.1.629,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng
7558655,Weak electromagnetic fields improve body image perception in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with various cognitive deficits and it has been suggested that it be considered a form of subcortical dementia. It is now recognized that visuoperceptive and visuomotor deficits commonly occur in MS patients particularly in those with chronic progressive course of the disease. The Human Figure Drawing Test has been employed in the assessment of generalized intellectual deterioration and specifically in the evaluation of visuoperceptive, visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities in brain injured patients. I have demonstrated recently, on the basis of various drawing test, the external application of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range intensity improved visuoperceptive and visuospatial functions in patients with MS. In the present communication I present five MS patients who were administered the Human Figure Drawing Test before and after a series of treatments with EMFs. Prior to application of EMFs four of these patients' drawings showed distortions, poor perspectives, impoverished facial expression, and lack of attention to details suggesting poor body image perception related to right posterior hemispheric dysfunction. In response to the administration of EMFs the group demonstrated improvement in motor disability which was associated with a striking improvement in the drawing particularly the drawings of the face the perception of which is localized to the right parietal lobe. These findings demonstrate that treatment with pT EMFs improves body image perception in MS patients thus corroborating previous observations which demonstrated this treatment modality to exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions in patients with MS.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459508999807,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

If on the one hand, the stimulation of the vestibular system in healthy subjects provokes body representation distortions, accompanied by a decrease of body temperature, on the other hand, in brain-damaged patients it transiently restores body representation disorders. So far, the physiological counterpart of such behavioural amelioration on patients has never been explored. Here we aimed at investigating body temperature variations following Caloric Vestibular Stimulation (CVS), in a patient affected by somatoparaphrenia who regained the sense of body part ownership after the stimulation. Results showed an increase in body temperature after CVS, which also correlated with the temporary restored sense of limb ownership.

This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.05.017,,Body recognition; Body-related disorders; Heterotopagnosia; Self-other distinction; Stroke; Virtual reality,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

12372347,"The man who executed ""imagined"" movements: evidence for dissociable components of the body schema.","Schwoebel, John; Boronat, Consuelo B; Branch Coslett, H",Schwoebel,"We examined the nature of representations underlying motor imagery and execution in a patient (CW) with bilateral parietal lesions. When imagining hand movements, CW executed the imagined motor act but was unaware of the movements. These movements were significantly more accurate than volitional movements for the left but not right hand. CW also exhibited preserved motor imagery for the left but not right hand. Consistent with previous accounts, these findings suggest that motor imagery may normally involve the inhibition of movements. CW's unawareness of movements during motor imagery may reflect inattention or misattribution of the unexpected sensory feedback. Furthermore, in line with current models of motor control, motor imagery may depend on the integrity of a ""forward model"" derived from motor outflow information to generate a prediction of the consequences of a motor command.

17119306,Construction and psychometric properties of a novel test for body representational neglect (Vest Test).,"Glocker, D; Bittl, P; Kerkhoff, G",Glocker,"Multimodal spatial neglect manifests itself also in nonvisual modalities such as audition, touch and body representation. Yet, quantitative tests for the diagnosis of nonvisual neglect are still quite rare. The purpose of the present paper was to develop and evaluate a novel, simple and sensitive test for the assessment of body representational neglect (BRN) in patients with left or right cerebral hemispheric lesions. The vest test covers the front part of the trunk. The blindfolded subject wears the vest and is instructed to pick up all objects from the 24 pockets of the vest (12 on each side) as quickly as possible using the ipsilesional, nonparetic hand. Two samples of healthy control subjects (each N=25) using either their left or their right hand performed the test in identical way to obtain normative data for patients searching with their left hand (i.e. left hemisphere stroke patients) versus their right hand (i.e. right hemisphere stroke patients). The test can be performed within 5~minutes, even with aphasic or apractic stroke patients. Psychometric evaluations in a sample of 50 patients with unilateral stroke (25 leftsided, 25 rightsided) show high objectivity, high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.96), good retest-reliability (0.79 after 1 week in neglect patients) and good validity as compared with two other measures of BRN or multimodal neglect. Patient examples show that BRN as assessed with the vest test allows the detection of qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of BRN, and shows double dissociations from visual neglect and from apraxia in left hemisphere stroke patients. Details of the test including instructions and cut-off values are given for users in the appendix of this article. In conclusion, the vest test is a sensitive, quick and reliable test for BRN which complements the assessment of visuo- and audiospatial neglect and allows to measure recovery (spontaneous or treatment-induced) in patients with BRN. Furthermore, it can help to improve our knowledge about the multisensory coding of our body and the surrounding space in the human brain.",{},,Restorative neurology and neuroscience,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

This report concerns two MS patients with chronic disabling ataxia who experienced rapid improvement in gait and balance after receiving a series of treatments with EMFs. To assess whether improvement in cerebellar gait is accompanied by changes in body image perception, a parietal lobe function, both patients were administered the Human Figure Drawing Test before and after a series of brief treatments with EMFs. Prior to application of EMFs these patients' free drawings of a person showed a figure with a wide-based stance characteristic of cerebellar ataxia. After receiving a series of EMFs treatments both patients demonstrated a change in body image perception with the drawings of the human figure showing a normal stance. These findings demonstrate that in MS improvement in cerebellar symptoms by pulsed applications of picotesla EMFs is associated with changes in the body image.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459608986700,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

18632094,Deficient mental own-body imagery in a neurological patient with out-of-body experiences due to cannabis use.,"Overney, Leila S; Arzy, Shahar; Blanke, Olaf",Overney,"In the present work, we report repeated out-of-body experiences (OBEs) in a patient with tetraplegia and severe somatosensory loss due to multiple sclerosis and predominant involvement of the cervical spinal cord. OBEs were experienced on a daily basis and induced by cannabis treatment that was started for severe spasticity with painful cramps and cloni. In order to investigate the link between OBEs and mental own-body imagery, the patient was asked to imagine himself in the position and visual perspective that is generally reported during OBEs, using front- and back-facing schematic human stimuli. Performance was measured before and after cannabis consumption. First, our data reveal that the patient was less accurate for back-facing than front-facing stimuli. This was found before and after cannabis consumption and is the opposite pattern to what is generally observed in healthy participants and in our control subjects (who did not use cannabis). We refer to this as lesion effect and argue that this relative facilitation for stimuli reflecting the position and visual perspective that is generally reported during OBEs might be due to recurrent and spontaneous own-body transformations during the patient's frequent OBEs. Secondly, we found a cannabis effect, namely a performance improvement in the back-facing condition while performance in the front-facing condition remained unchanged, after cannabis administration. We argue that cannabis administration may interfere with own-body imagery when reflecting the actual body position and only when associated with brain damage. Based on these data we propose an extended neurological model for own-body illusions including multisensory and sensorimotor mechanisms, cannabis consumption, and cortical and subcortical processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2008.02.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We report the unique case of a patient with somatoparaphrenia in whom dense tactile imperception in the left hand dramatically recovered when she was instructed to report touches delivered to her niece's hand, rather than to her own hand. We suggest that, through this verbal instruction, the mismatch between the patient's belief about the ownership of her left hand and her ability to perceive touch on it was transiently recomposed.

19397870,Heterotopagnosia: When I point at parts of your body.,"Cleret de Langavant, Laurent; Trinkler, Iris; Cesaro, Pierre; Bachoud-Lévi, Anne-Catherine",Cleret de Langavant,"Heterotopagnosia is the acquired inability of brain-lesioned patients to point at someone else's body parts when prompted. The cognitive basis of this disorder is unclear. It might result from a biological function deficit critical for communication in human beings; alternatively, it could result from the disruption of a body representation. Here, we report three patients with heterotopagnosia following a recent left parieto-occipital stroke and a previous insular lesion. The patients were tested on their ability to name, point out and grasp several targets including body parts (own, real others' and figurative others'). Language, visuo-spatial deficits or any confounding neuropsychological disorders were controlled for. We found that the patients erroneously pointed to their own body parts when asked to point at someone else's. Strikingly, their ability to grasp someone else's body parts was largely unimpaired. The dissociation between their grasping and communicative pointing abilities supports the hypothesis that heterotopagnosia is a disorder of communicative function conveyed by pointing but not by grasping. In addition, pointing performance in our patients varied according to the target: the more similar the target was to a real person, the worse the patients' pointing performance. We suggest that communicative pointing might require a specific representation of the addressee's body and point of view, a heterocentric representation. In the patients described here this phenomenon resulted from a combined insulo-parietal lesion, which may explain why, in contrast to other patients described previously, the heterotopagnosia was long-lasting.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.02.016,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This dissociation between different aspects of body representation supports Sirigu et al.'s hypothesis that multiple, partially independent systems are involved in body knowledge. In agreement with this hypothesis, in the present patient AT seems be due to a deficit in a system that processes the structural properties and relative position of single body parts.

The patient presented with anosognosia and hemiasomatognosia and negligence of the right half-field. She was aprosodic, not aphasic, and there was a severe apraxia and total agraphia. These neuropsychological disorders are discussed in relation to the contradictory data relative to the manual lateralization of the patient. Findings in this case of a ""crossed apraxia"" show that management of language and of the propositional gestures are not necessarily ensured by the same hemisphere. It also appears that manual preference may be a poor clue for interpretation in terms of functional lateralization.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre
