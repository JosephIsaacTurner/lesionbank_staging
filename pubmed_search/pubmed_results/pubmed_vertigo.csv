Computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor and an intracranial hematoma in the right frontal lobe. The tumor was totally removed, and postoperative radiation therapy was administrated locally at 50 Gy. Five years later, he experienced sudden onset of headache and vertigo. CT demonstrated a mass lesion with a hematoma in the cerebellar vermis. The tumor was subtotally removed and he underwent postoperative local irradiation at 50 Gy as well as ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Four years later, he complained of visual and gait disturbances, and CT disclosed a tumor in the suprasellar region. Following partial removal of the tumor, local brain irradiation was given at 40 Gy.

Silent infarction refers to ischemic changes observed on imaging studies without accompanying clinical symptoms; however, this condition is clinically significant owing to the increased risk of future stroke. We report a case of left-sided SSNHL accompanied by dizziness in a 62-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with left pontine infarction without any other neurological symptoms. The cochlea and pons receive blood supply from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery; the cochlea lacks collateral vessels and is therefore susceptible to fluctuations in blood flow.

Currently, misdiagnoses between peripheral and central lesions are frequent, and diagnostic testing costs are high. Identifying the characteristics of these 2 conditions is challenging. We can provide better treatment if we can establish a diagnosis earlier. Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) at the cerebellum is a cerebellar lesion that causes symptoms of central vertigo. We report a patient, 20th years old, female, with vertigo for 1 month before being admitted. Vertigo was getting worse, and when the patient arrived at our hospital, vertigo was accompanied by headache, right and left abducens nerve palsy, horizontal nystagmus bidirectional, vertical nystagmus, and weakness on the right side of the body. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before surgery and shows a lesion suggestive of CCM at the cerebellum with a hemorrhagic component inside and non-communicating hydrocephalus. There is no vascular malformation based on digital subtraction angiography result. MRI is the most sensitive and specific modality for detecting CCM, whereas cerebral angiography rarely detects this malformation. The patient got surgical treatment, with suboccipital decompression procedures and CCM excision. The histopathological results after surgical treatment revealed a cerebral cavernous malformation.

The vestibular system consists of the vestibular labyrinth, cranial nerve VIII, brainstem vestibular nuclei, cerebellum, ocular motor nuclei, spinal cord, and less well-defined cerebral projections. In this day and age of artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced imaging, and cutting-edge research in the field of neurology, the exact cortical control of vestibular function is still uncharted. A 45-year-old woman with a past medical history of labyrinthitis about 4.5 years ago (resolved) presented to hospital due to severe dizziness, emesis, and mild vertical diplopia for the past few days. Her symptom of dizziness i.e. room spinning was continuous without any postural component. MRI of the brain revealed a small stroke in the left hippocampal area, more specifically alveus of hippocampus. The patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy and atorvastatin for secondary stroke prevention. Follow-up visit as an outpatient at one-month post hospital discharge was unremarkable without any recurrence of vertigo symptoms. We believe this may indicate that the limbic lobe has a much larger role in vestibular functioning than previously thought, and may control more vestibular operations than any other central nervous system area.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.41061,PMC10375059,dizziness; limbic lobe; stroke; vertigo; vestibular cortex,Case Reports,United States,eng

The clinical examination on admission revealed an incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, associating hemiface sensitive deficit, Horner's syndrome, dysmetria and nystagmus. The brain MRI showed a latero-medullary infarct with a homolateral PICA thrombosed dissecting aneurysm. The diagnosis of intracranial dissecting aneurysms needs particular caution because aneurysm sac thrombosis can give false reassurance on angiographic MR sequences. Moreover, the anatomic features of intracranial artery walls make them prone to sub-adventitial dissection and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhages. Therefore, antithrombotic therapy should be used with caution, due to the risk of bleeding in these intracranial dissections.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-05923-1,,Aneurysm sac thrombosis; Arterial intracranial dissection; Dissection aneurysm; Ischemic stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The purpose of this study is to report clinical and laboratory findings of isolated nodular infarction. Eight patients with isolated nodular infarction were recruited from 6 hospitals in Korea. All patients underwent a complete and standardized neurotological evaluation including ocular torsion, bithermal caloric tests, and rotatory chair test in addition to MRI and MR angiography. All patients presented with isolated vertigo and moderate to severe imbalance. The most common manifestation was unilateral nystagmus and falling in the opposite direction, which mimicked peripheral vestibulopathy. Six patients had unilateral lesion, and 2 showed bilateral lesions. The direction of the spontaneous nystagmus was all ipsilesional in the unilateral lesion. However, head impulse and bithermal caloric tests were normal. Other findings include periodic alternating nystagmus, perverted head shaking nystagmus, paroxysmal positional nystagmus, and impaired tilt suppression of the postrotatory nystagmus. Hypoplasia of the ipsilesional vertebral artery was the only abnormal finding on MR angiography in 3 patients. The prognosis was excellent. Isolated nodular infarction mostly presents with isolated vertigo mimicking acute peripheral vestibulopathy. However, severe imbalance and a negative head impulse test are important clinical discriminants between nodular infarcts and peripheral vestibular dysfunction. The findings of isolated nodular infarctions are consistent with impaired gravito-inertial processing of the vestibular signals and disrupted nodular inhibition on the vestibular secondary neurons and the velocity storage mechanism.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Stroke,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.527762,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Appropriate history and neurodiagnostic testing are essential to encompass the extended spectrum of clinical and radiological differentials of ABS. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with slurred speech, dizziness, right-sided facial droop, and numbness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed non-enhancing hyperintensities in the right lateral pons and brachium pontis, eventually extending to the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, pons, left>right cerebellar hemisphere, right thalamocapsular region, and midbrain region. Lumbar puncture revealed 3 cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands. Initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis led to high-dose intravenous steroid treatment. The patient continued to deteriorate, leading to multiple emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Additional history revealing previously diagnosed, treatment-naive HIV prompted a repeat lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC polyomavirus (JCV) was positive, leading to the diagnosis of clinically isolated brainstem PML. Unfortunately, the patient developed pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure, which ultimately led to her death. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need for considering isolated brainstem PML, as a diagnostic possibility, in patients presenting with acute-subacute brainstem symptoms and compatible neuroimaging findings. Clinicians need to be aware of varying PML presentations with brainstem or diencephalic variants, as well as monofocal lesions. The prognosis for PML has improved somewhat, secondary to immune reconstitution by highly active antiretroviral therapy, risk stratification in drug-induced PML, and other emerging treatments, such as pembrolizumab.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.935019,PMC8762610,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Spontaneous or positional rotatory vertigo with unidirectional spontaneous horizontal nystagmus, associated with the postural imbalance and unilateral lateropulsion or fall on Romberg's test, was the most common clinical picture. According to our literature review, the discriminant clinical elements which differentiate ICNI from APV were direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, bilateral lateropulsion or fall on Romberg's test, and normal horizontal head impulse test. Our two patients reported a positional fleeting abnormal visual perception of spatial orientation of objects. We proposed this symptom as a discriminant clinical element.

Herein, we present a case of previous West Nile encephalitis with diffuse leukoencephalopathy on imaging that demonstrates a favorable clinical outcome with limited neurologic sequelae. A 53-year-old male presented to the hospital with one month of headaches, dizziness, generalized weakness, and a seizure. His initial neurologic exam was notable for wide-based gait and imbalance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated diffuse bilateral white matter signal hyperintensities without contrast enhancement, suggestive of leukoencephalopathy. His lumbar puncture revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and infectious studies demonstrated positive West Nile Virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum with negative immunoglobulin M (IgM) in both CSF and serum, suggestive of previous infection. A diagnosis of sequelae of West Nile neuroinvasive disease was made. He was started on anti-seizure medications without further seizures. At his subsequent nine-month follow-up visit, he remained asymptomatic without weakness, headaches, or confusion. Repeat MRI demonstrated interval improvement of white matter signal change.

However, mastication induced nystagmus in five (24 %) of the 21 patients without spontaneous nystagmus (SN) but with a previous history of a vestibular syndrome, and either increased (21/31, 68 %) or decreased (7/31, 23 %) the SN in almost all the patients (28/31, 90 %) with SN. Mastication may induce significant vertigo and nystagmus in patients with a prior history of acute vestibulopathy. The induction or modulation of nystagmus by mastication in both peripheral and central vestibulopathies supports trigeminal modulation of the vestibular system in human. The gradual build-up and dissipation suggest a role of the velocity storage mechanism in the generation of mastication-induced vertigo and nystagmus.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-013-7221-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Yet, the presentation of simplex vertiginous experience and spontaneous downbeat nystagmus (DBN) has not been reported to date. We present the case of a 26-year-old male with focal onset impaired awareness seizures, characterized by vertigo due to right temporal lobe epilepsy caused by ganglioglioma. As rare presentations, a spontaneous, consistent DBN in the absence of vertiginous experience was noticed. MRI suggested lesion in the right temporal pole. Twenty-four-hour continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring recorded periodic sharp and slow waves, originating from the right temporal lobe. The patient was completely relieved of the symptoms after surgical removal of the tumor, which was histologically confirmed as Grade I Ganglioglioma. Asides from the cortical pathogenesis of epileptic vertigo, this case also provides insight into the DBN secondary to tumor of the temporal lobe. Moreover, the 24-h EEG is advantageous to recognize vestibular seizures and localize the ictal onset areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-023-03311-6,PMC10364402,24-hour Electroencephalogram; Case report; Downbeat nystagmus; Gangliogliomas; Vestibular seizures,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Treatment consisted of adequate hydration, intravenous dexamethasone, mannitol, and anticonvulsants. The patient demonstrated progressive neurological improvement, and recovered from all symptoms on the fifth day. Follow-up at 3 months shows a good prognosis for patients. Patients with CIE may have a high signal on diffusion-weighted imaging and a low signal on apparent diffusion coefficient brain MRI. This is similar to the MRI findings in acute stroke.

We report on a patient with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), who showed injury of the VCT, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study recruited an 81-year-old male patient presented with quadriparesis due to ICH on both cerebellar hemispheres and 5 control subjects. A patient had the dizziness that was occurred when he moved and the motor weakness in lower limb. The primary and secondary VCTs of a patient with total 25 score of Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia were reconstructed using DTI. The results of DTI parameters of primary VCT showed that the tract volumes of primary VCT in both hemispheres of a patient showed significant decrease compared to those of control subjects. All of DTI parameters of ipsilateral secondary VCT in left hemisphere of a patient were within the reference range. Additionally, the ipsilateral secondary VCT in right hemisphere and the contralateral secondary VCTs in both hemispheres of a patient were not reconstructed. We suggest that a patient's ataxia appears to be related to injury of the VCT.

We herein review the tumour characteristics, differential diagnosis and treatment policy of this rare disease. We conducted a PUBMED search using a combination of words 'Rosai-Dorfman disease', 'Central nervous system', and identified 42 cases of such a disease infecting exclusively central nervous system. Out of those cases only one case was reported to be purely intracerebellar making our case the second one in the literature. Clinical features, differential diagnosis, treatment details and follow-up were discussed. We also described the case of 41-year-old man presented with vertiginous symptoms and mild cerebellar ataxia who was diagnosed with a solitary lesion localised deep in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Immunohistological findings revealed Rosai-Dorfman disease. The most common locations of the tumour were frontal and parietal region, but CNS lesions have commonly involved the skull base with a leptomeningeal component too. The median age at presentation was in the third decade, ranging from 3 to 78 years. There is a slight male predominance. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 11 years. Recurrence was not observed in the cases where total surgical excision was performed. Though Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rarity, one should take it into a consideration when treating solitary intracerebellar lesion. Thorough preoperative evaluation is mandatory and biopsy should be done whenever feasible. Surgical treatment of this type of tumour is not always necessary, however, it is essential for postulating the right diagnosis. When total tumour removal is achieved, the outcome is generally better, with minimal risk of recurrence and with no need for further additional therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,British journal of neurosurgery,10.3109/02688697.2010.546899,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

They have mostly been associated with testicular germ cell tumors (tGCTs). Two patients with KLHL11-IgG encephalitis are reported, and the literature is comprehensively reviewed. Patient 1 had been in remission from a tGCT 10 years prior. He developed episodic vertigo and diplopia progressing over a few days. Treatment with corticosteroids (CSs) was started a few days after symptom onset. Patient 2 had transient diplopia, which resolved spontaneously. Visual problems persisted for 7 months, when he additionally developed a progressive cerebellar syndrome. One year after onset, CS treatment was started. Initial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable in both patients, but analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed chronic inflammation. KLHL11-IgG was positive in both patients (Patient 1 only in CSF, Patient 2 in serum). Neoplastic screening has so far not revealed any signs of active underlying malignancy.

All these symptoms were gradually aggravated and followed by vomiting and unfavorable movement of the right limbs. All these symptoms gradually aggravated. Neurological examination on admission showed ataxia of the right limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed a right cerebellar infarction. High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging showed dissection of the right vertebral artery.

Posterior circulation strokes can be diagnostically challenging because the presenting symptoms are often subtle or non-focal and can be missed by commonly used stroke scales. This case report describes a patient who presented to the ED with symptoms of progressive dizziness over a 12-h period, which was followed by the rapid onset of an inability to swallow and, at the time of his presentation, no other neurologic deficits. CASE REPORT The patient was a 55-year-old man with a history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tobacco and electronic cigarette use, and aortic atherosclerosis who presented to the ED for evaluation of his inability to swallow. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was zero. Non-contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple foci of acute infarction in the left dorsolateral medulla and left cerebellar hemisphere in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution. In the hospital, the patient developed an inability to stand, without loss of balance. Persistent dysphagia and inability to swallow necessitated the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS This case describes a relatively rare type of posterior circulation stroke. In addition to traditional risk factors, this patient had risk factors, such as electronic cigarette use, for which there is limited emerging evidence of association with stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.930502,PMC8141337,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A neurological examination revealed a hemianopsia with a visual field loss on the right side. In addition, a mild aphasic syndrome with agraphia and a word-finding disorder (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS): 3 points) was diagnosed. The initial brain CT scan with CT angiography showed neither an intracerebral haemorrhage nor a cerebral infarction. Also, no occlusion or any signs of artery dissection or a flow relevant stenosis of the brain supplying arteries were found. After excluding other contraindications, an intravenous thrombolysis with weight-adapted alteplase was performed. The symptoms of the patient significantly improved in the short-term follow-up. Three days after admission no neurological deficits remained. The MRI of the brain revealed multifocal, small, left hemispherical strokes in the middle cerebral artery territory.

Prosopagnosia can be categorized as developmental (DP) or acquired (AP) owing to a variety of underlying conditions, including trauma, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, neuroinfections, and, less frequently, malignancies. Facial recognition is a complex process in which different neuronal networks are involved. The infrequent but notable higher visual-processing abnormalities can be caused by lesions of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) in the non-dominant temporal lobe. We report a rare case of AP in a 69-year-old patient who is right-hand dominant with rectal carcinoma cerebral metastases. The patient complained of dizziness, vertigo, falls, and trouble recognizing her family members' faces. The CT scan of the head with contrast revealed two metastatic brain lesions with vasogenic edema, as one of them was in the right cerebellar hemisphere, causing dislocation and compression of the ILF. Corticosteroids and osmotherapy were utilized as a conservative treatment approach, which resulted in the prosopagnosia being completely withdrawn. In conclusion, patients with primary brain tumors or metastatic disease rarely present with an isolated cognitive deficit such as prosopagnosia. Based on the anatomical features and the personalized approach, a conservative or surgical approach may be useful to improve higher cortical functioning.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.55349,PMC10981948,acquired prosopagnosia; brain tumor; cerebral tumor; cognitive; face blindness; higher cortical functions; language disorder; metastatic; prosopagnosia; tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

Labyrinthine concussion (LC) is an uncommon diagnosis, as is multiple canal (MC) benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This case report highlights physical therapist (PT) evaluation and treatment of an elderly male misdiagnosed with LC and successfully treated for MC BPPV. A 72 year old male presented to his PT 23 days after falling off a ladder, resulting in a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Diagnosed with LC, he was referred to PT due to ongoing symptoms of ""falling backwards,"" poor gait, and diminished mobility. PT examination revealed an atypical BPPV. Thus, the patient was treated in two PT visits, which included canalith repositioning techniques and neuromuscular reeducation. The PT diagnosis was MC BPPV, including the right lateral and left posterior semicircular canals. Initial positive findings of Head Impulse Test, Bow and Lean Test, Dix-Hallpike, and Roll Test were negative on the last visit. Patient-Specific Functional Scale improved from 0 to 9.9 (10 being no limitations). The patient progressed from minimum assistance to independence in bed mobility, transfers, gait, and previous activities. The patient's presentation was atypical in signs and symptoms with a diagnosis of LC. PT examination and intervention successfully resolved the patient's signs and symptoms within two visits.

A 47-year-old female presented with a 4-month history of progressive headache, nausea, and dizziness. She complained of double vision and exhibited upward gaze palsy and papilledema on fundoscopy. Radiological examination revealed subacute hemorrhage in the pineal region and enlarged lateral ventricles. Furthermore, T2-star-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a linear hypointensity along the pial surface of the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum, indicating hemosiderin deposition consistent with superficial siderosis. Suspecting the presence of a cavernous malformation based on the radiological findings of superficial siderosis, we performed total mass resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and her preoperative symptoms resolved completely. Radiological findings of superficial siderosis on T2-star-weighted gradient-echo imaging are useful to making a diagnosis of cavernous malformation in cases of pineal apoplexy.

Brain MRI showed two small areas of restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging in the left hemisphere. The digital subtraction angiography showed his left middle cerebral artery and bilateral anterior cerebral artery were supplied by the basilar artery via a persistent trigeminal artery. Furthermore, CT perfusion showed no remarkable difference between the two hemispheres. Persistent trigeminal artery may have a protective role in the setting of an acquired occlusion of homolateral internal carotid artery. Therefore, it is important to fully assess the presence of the persistent trigeminal artery in acute ischemic stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-019-1374-7,PMC6621997,Anastomosis; Cerebrovascular disorders; Persistent trigeminal artery (PTA); Risk; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A functional neurological disorder was suspected, and she was seen by several psychiatrists and psychotherapists. However, she suspected a neuroanatomical lesion would better explain her unrelenting symptoms. After seeing many neurologists, a neuroanatomical diagnosis was finally made. The theory and practice of medicine mandate that subjective complaint guides the modality and interpretation of objective evidence. The final neurologist knew where on neuroimaging to look because she was guided by the patient's complaints - vertigo and unilateral tongue pain.

36593745,Global Transient Amnesia as the Predominant Symptom of Cardiac Myxoma: A Case Report.,"Shrestha, Pritee; Obholz, Jacob; Chang, Tiffany; Adio, Babajide",Shrestha,"BACKGROUND The most common neurological symptoms from cardiac myxoma-induced stroke include territories of middle cerebral arteries, rendering posterior stroke less common. Although transient global amnesia usually has a benign prognosis, amnesia in the setting of concerning cerebellar symptoms should raise the suspicion for posterior circulation involvement. These benign-appearing symptoms can be manifestations of an acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA). This unusual presentation can delay workup for underlying pathology. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old woman presented to the local emergency department after an episode of global amnesia that lasted about 15 minutes and was associated with some dizziness. The patient also reported a history of chronic disequilibrium. The head CT scan was negative for any acute findings. A follow-up MRI of the brain demonstrated acute small lacunar infarcts within the left cerebellum and right parietal lobe. An echocardiogram was performed due to concern for the cardioembolic source, which revealed left atrial myxoma. She was transferred to a tertiary center for immediate surgical intervention due to the high risk of embolization associated with the condition. The patient subsequently underwent successful surgical excision of the lesion. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac myxoma, although a rare cause of posterior stroke, needs prompt intervention as it is associated with a high risk of systemic embolization, including recurrent CVA. Transient global amnesia is an atypical presentation of cardiac myxoma that can easily be overlooked, delaying timely diagnosis and prompt intervention. Early recognition and surgical resection are crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.938221,PMC9826667,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The authors report their experience with 2-stage resections of large VSs and analyze the indications, facial nerve outcomes, surgical results, and complications. The authors compare these results with those of a similar cohort of patients who underwent a single-stage resection. A retrospective review of all patients (age > 18 years) who underwent surgery from 2002 to 2010 for large (≥ 3 cm) VSs at the authors' institution with a minimum of 6 months follow-up was undertaken. A first-stage retrosigmoid approach (without meatal drilling) was performed to remove the cerebellopontine angle portion of the tumor and to decompress the brainstem. A decision to stage the operation was made intraoperatively if there was cerebellar or brainstem edema, excessive tumor adherence to the facial nerve or brainstem, a poorly stimulating facial nerve, or a thinned or splayed facial nerve. A second-stage translabyrinthine approach was performed at a later date to remove the remaining tumor. The single-stage resection consisted of a retrosigmoid approach with meatal drilling. Patient charts were evaluated for tumor size, extent of resection, tumor recurrence, House-Brackmann facial nerve function grade, and complications. Twenty-eight and 19 patients underwent 2- or single-stage resection of a large VS, respectively. The average tumor size was 3.9 cm (range 3.2-7 cm) in the 2-stage group and 3.9 cm (range 3.1-5 cm) in the single-stage group. The mean follow-up was 36 ± 19 months in the 2-stage group versus 24 ± 14 months in the single-stage group. Gross-total or near-total resection was achieved in 27 (96.4%) of 28 patients in the 2-stage group and 15 (79%) of 19 patients in the single-stage group (p < 0.01). Anatomical facial nerve preservation was achieved in all but 1 patient (94.7%), and there were no recurrences on follow-up imaging in the 2-stage group. Good facial nerve functional outcome (House-Brackmann Grades I and II) at last follow-up was achieved in 23 (82%) of 28 patients in the 2-stage group and 10 (53%) of 19 patients in the single-stage group (p < 0.01). Cerebrospinal fluid leak-related complications (intracranial hypotension, blood patch, and lumboperitoneal shunt for pseudomeningocele) were more common in the 2-stage group. There were no postoperative strokes, hemorrhages, or deaths in either group. The authors' results suggest that staged resection of large VSs may potentially achieve better facial nerve outcomes. There does not appear to be added neurological morbidity with staged resections.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2012.1.JNS111402,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Due to the lack of specific manifestations during the initial onset of NTM otomastoiditis, physicians may misdiagnose it as cholesteatoma or other common bacterial infections. A 44-year-old male who complained of left-sided aural fullness, otalgia, and dizziness for 2 months. The initial diagnosis was hypothesized to be cholesteatoma based on a whitish mass with mucoid discharge filling the entire outer ear canal on otoscopy and left-sided mixed hearing loss. However, NTM was identified by microbial culture at the 2-month follow-up after surgery. The patient underwent a left-sided exploratory tympanotomy. Because NTM otomastoiditis was diagnosed, 3 weeks of starting therapies were administered with azithromycin (500 mg/day, oral administration), cefoxitin (3 g/day, intravenous drip), and amikacin (750 mg/day, intravenous drip). The maintenance therapies were azithromycin (500 mg/day, oral administration) and doxycycline (200 mg/day, oral administration) for 7 months. The patient's clinical condition improved initially after surgery, but the otomastoiditis gradually worsened, combined with subtle meningitis, 2 months after surgery. The external auditory canal became swollen and obstructed, making it difficult to monitor the treatment efficacy through otoscopy. Thus, we used regular vestibular function tests, including static posturography, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and video Head Impulse Test, to assess recovery outcomes.

To date, very few reports have described CED in patients with medullary infarction. A 76-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of vertigo and right hemiparesis, accompanied by CED to the right with gaze palsy to the left. Her brain magnetic resonance imaging showed left upper medial medullary infarction involving the left nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and adjacent to the left inferior olivary nucleus (ION). After treatments with 200 mg of aspirin and 60 mg of edaravone daily, symptoms gradually improved. The NPH and ION constitute NPH-ION-floccus-vestibular nucleus loop and contribute to the inhibitory mechanisms for horizontal eye movements. In addition, NPH projects excitatory neurons to the contralateral vestibular nucleus. In our case, disorders of the NPH and ION might have dysregulated inhibitory and excitatory projections, and thereby cause CED to the right with gaze palsy to the left. This represents a rare case showing CED to the contralesional side in upper medial medullary infarction.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.05.014,,Stroke; case report; conjugate eye deviation; medial medullary infarction,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

36536304,Sudden unilateral hearing loss and vertigo following isolated cerebellar hypoperfusion without infarction due to vertebral artery dissection.,"Kim, Young Seo; Tehrani, Ali S Saber; Lee, Hak Seung",Kim,"The definition of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is broadly accepted as acute sensorineural hearing loss of more than 30 dB over at least three consecutive frequencies in a pure-tone audiogram (PTA). Acute audiovestibular loss is common with ischaemic stroke in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). However, cases in which SSNHL and vertigo occur with hypoperfusion alone are very rare. We describe a patient who developed unilateral SSNHL and vertigo as initial symptoms caused by cerebellar hypoperfusion by vertebral artery (VA) dissection without the occurrence of infarction. A 51-year-old man suddenly developed acute hearing loss (AHL) in his left ear and vertigo. On neurological examination, he had vibration-induced right-beating nystagmus and left-beating nystagmus after a head-shaking test. Additionally, he had apogeotropic nystagmus during head turns to either side. The head impulse test (HIT) was normal. PTA showed mild unilateral SSNHL in the left ear. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) showed territorial perfusion deficits in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) without infarction. Two months later, the patient had no vertigo but still had hearing impairment in his left ear. A follow-up PTA documented persistent unilateral SSNHL in the left ear. Additionally, perfusion computed tomography (CT) showed that perfusion deficits remained in the left cerebellum along the PICA and AICA territories. Our case highlights a case of AHL and vertigo presented by isolated cerebellar hypoperfusion without infarction. It is necessary to consider the possibility of a central cause in patients with AHL and vertigo, and it is important to confirm this possibility through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including PWI, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-03024-2,PMC9762102,Acute hearing loss; Case report; Hypoperfusion; Infarction; Perfusion-weighted imaging; Vertigo,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report a case of symptomatic intracranial vertebral artery stenosis with repeated cerebral infarction treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting and monitoring of oxygen saturation by a brain oximeter. The patient was a 76-year-old man referred to our hospital due to infarction in the right cerebellum. Angiography showed 60% stenosis in the right vertebral artery and 90% stenosis in the left vertebral artery with progressive stenosis in the left. The patient was treated with intravenous and oral triple antiplatelet therapy but had dizziness again with new cerebral infarctions in the left cerebellum and right pontine. We shaved the patient's hair up to the superior nuchal line and placed left and right oximeter probes on each cerebellar hemisphere (2 cm lateral and 2 cm caudal from the external occipital protuberance). Under evaluation of blood flow in the posterior circulation with INVOS Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter, PTA and stent placement were performed for left vertebral artery stenosis. Postoperatively, the dizziness disappeared, and the patient was discharged on his own with good outcome. He has not had a recurrent stroke in over 6 years. Although medical treatment is generally considered the first choice for VBA stenosis, recurrent cerebral infarction occurs at a high rate in symptomatic lesions, and the prognosis is poor. In addition, the perioperative complication rate is not low, and there is no established method for evaluating perfusion of posterior circulation. The brain oximeter is already known to be useful in carotid artery (CA) revascularisation. In this report, we were able to perform a minimally invasive evaluation of blood flow in the posterior circulation using the brain oximeter which might be useful for surgical revascularisation not only in CA but also in VBA.",{},,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,10.1007/978-3-031-14190-4_22,,Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome; Cerebral infarction; Regional cerebral oxygen saturation; Surgical treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 45-year-old male resident of a dormitory presented to our unit with acute vertigo and left-sided dysmetria. NIHSS was 2. The initial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, middle cerebellar peduncle and hemipons. An extensive work-up for stroke etiologies was unremarkable. Despite having no fever, respiratory symptoms, anosmia or ageusia, he was isolated and screened for COVID-19 due to his epidemiologic risks, with multiple residents from his dormitory being recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Confirming our suspicion, his respiratory samples returned positive for COVID-19. His D-dimer levels returned normal. Thereafter, the patient underwent posterior decompression surgery due to worsening edema caused by the cerebellar infarct. He was started on antiplatelet therapy and recovered significantly a month from presentation with an modified Rankin Sore of 2. He remained without typical COVID-19 symptoms.

While infarction of its vascular territory can result in a wide range of symptoms, paramedian thalamic syndrome is classically described as a triad of symptoms including vertical gaze disturbances, fluctuating level of consciousness, and amnesia. There is minimal evidence to date to characterize the long-term cognitive consequences of infarction of the artery of Percheron utilizing neuropsychological assessment. We describe a 40-year-old female patient initially presenting with dizziness, confusion and falls with unremarkable head CT scans. Subsequent MRI, more than 24 h after symptom onset, identified evidence of bilateral thalamic and rostral midbrain infarction. Neuropsychological testing was administered at 4 months post-stroke, with follow up testing at 1 year. The patient was found to have profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia, which did not change significantly over the first year of rehabilitation, and which was not easily identifiable in everyday encounters due to her relatively intact working memory and social skills. As early diagnosis of infarction of the artery of Percheron is challenging, patients have frequently missed the time window for acute management of ischemic stroke.

16432749,Cervical vertigo and dizziness after whiplash injury.,"Endo, Kenji; Ichimaru, Katsuji; Komagata, Mashashi; Yamamoto, Kengo",Endo,"Whiplash injury is not only limited to neck injury but also brainstem injury that does not involve direct damage to the neck or head. The symptoms of whiplash injury are polymorphous, with the most common complaints being cervical pain, headache and scapulodynia. Vertigo and dizziness are also reported in 25-50% of the cases. In otoneurologic studies, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is used for the evaluation of vertebrobasilar hemodynamics in patients who complain of dizziness and vertigo. It is reported that vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency (VBI) leads to brainstem and cerebellar ischemia and infarction following cervical manipulation. Here we examined the correlation between vertigo or dizziness and the right and left side difference in vertebral arteries after whiplash injury using MRA. We studied 20 patients who complained of neck pain with vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury and 13 healthy volunteers as a control. In the control group, abnormal MRA findings in the vertebral arteries such as occlusion, stenosis or slow blood flow were seen in 77% of the cases. In the patient group, abnormal MRA findings were seen in 60%. The side difference in blood flow was 3.5+/-2.5 cm/s in the control group and 6.1+/-3.0 cm/s in the patient group. Our findings suggest that some subjects with persistent vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury are more likely to have VBI on MRA. VBI might be an important background factor to evoke cervical vertigo or dizziness after whiplash injury. The side difference between the two vertebral arteries could cause a circulation disorder in the vertebrobasilar system after whiplash injury. However, the VBI on MRA itself was also seen in the control group, and thus it is not clear whether it is due to whiplash injury in the patient group.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",10.1007/s00586-005-0970-y,PMC3489433,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
32754407,"A Rare Case of a Large, Deceitfully Quiet Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformation Presenting Only as Dizziness.","Rao, Swathi; Giron, Fanny",Rao,"Dizziness is one of the most frequent complaints encountered in the medical practice affecting 15%-20% of adults yearly, and can be challenging to assess. Most patients use dizziness as a non-specific term, and thus suffer prejudice from the physicians' end and can be disregarded frequently. Dizziness can be a symptom of various diseases, some with sinister pathologies. We present a case of garden-variety vertigo that unfurled to be not-so-simple, emphasizing the importance of a thorough history and physical examination again even in the era of technology. A 32-year-old male patient with no past medical history presented with dizziness, later clarified as gradually progressive vertigo for two years, with unstable gait, dysarthria, and occasional diplopia. Physical examination found sustained nystagmus that changed direction with horizontal gaze, vertical nystagmus with upward gaze, dysarthria, and a wide-based ataxic gait. CT head without contrast revealed indeterminate hypodense areas in the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellar hemisphere. MRI brain identified a 2.8 x 3.4 x 4.2 cm Spetzler-Martin grade IV brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. Feeders were mostly from the posterior circulation, with three intranidal aneurysms, all draining into the deep venous system. The AVM was deemed inoperable, and the patient was treated with onyx embolization for two/three feeding vessel aneurysms. After treatment, the symptoms persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) six months after diagnosis, and was admitted a year later with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder. Brain AVMs are rare clinical entities that present in 0.1% of the population, mostly presenting as intracranial bleeds. When they do rarely present with isolated focal neurologic deficits, it has been attributed to a vascular steal phenomenon, hemorrhage, or a mass effect. The isolated findings of vertigo and dysarthria are highly non-specific; with such presentation, clinicians should consider etiologies under the realm of vertigo of central origin. An untreatable AVM reduces patients' quality of life and has been linked to depression and anxiety, and thus patients may benefit from psychosocial therapy. Although preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary concern with brain AVMs, the rest of the patient's profile should not be forgotten.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.8870,PMC7387078,arteriovenous malformation; dizziness; nystagmus; vertigo,Case Reports,United States,eng

She was initially investigated with a CT scan of the brain and lumbar puncture, which yielded no diagnosis. Subsequent MR scan revealed multiple posterior circulation infarcts, along with a previously undiagnosed Arnold-Chiari 2 malformation with an associated syrinx of her cervical and thoracic spine. The infarct involved one of the herniated cerebellar tonsils. Oedema of an infarct in the herniated tonsils caused compression of the medulla at the foramen magnum, with associated neurological symptoms including Lhermitte's phenomenon and headache on valsalva manoeuvre. Owing to these symptoms a surgical decompression was performed.

Few reports have carefully examined the deafness associated with the AICA infarction. Furthermore, previous neurological reports have not emphasized the inner ear as a localization of sudden deafness. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of deafness associated with the AICA infarction and the sites predominantly involved in deafness. Over 2 years, we prospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with unilateral AICA infarction diagnosed by brain MRI. Pure-tone audiogram, speech discrimination testing, stapedial reflex testing, and auditory brainstem response were performed to localize the site of lesion in the auditory pathways. Electronystagmography was also performed to evaluate the function of the vestibular system. The most common affected site on brain MRI was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n=11). Four patients had vertigo and/or acute auditory symptoms such as hearing loss or tinnitus as an isolated manifestation from 1 day to 2 months before infarction. Audiological testings confirmed sensorineural hearing loss in 11 patients (92%), predominantly cochlear in 6 patients, retrocochlear in 1 patient, and combined on the affected side cochlear and retrocochlear in 4 patients. Electronystagmography demonstrated no response to caloric stimulation in 10 patients (83%). In our series, sudden deafness was an important sign for the diagnosis of AICA infarction.

Arterial infusion catheter is commonly detained in hepatic artery via femoral or brachial artery. In our hospital, catheter is often inserted by puncturing the left subclavian or brachial artery considering the patient's activities of daily living (ADL) during long-term detaining. However, it rarely causes posterior circulation ischemic stroke because of the left vertebral artery branches on the path of catheter. We herein report a case of posterior circulation ischemic stroke caused by heparin-induced thrombosis (HIT) after detaining hepatic arterial infusion catheter. A 63-year-old man who is under HAIC treatment for HCC was introduced to the department of neurological surgery because of vertigo and vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed sporadic fresh cerebral infarction in the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere. Carotid ultrasonography detected a floating thrombus around the part of the left vertebral subclavian artery bifurcation. Detained catheter was removed and continuous heparin administration was started immediately. However, thrombocytopenia occurred 5 days after the injection. Because 4T's score was 6 points, HIT was strongly suspected. We stopped heparin injection immediately and observed the patient's physical status strictly. After that, platelet value improved naturally.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarction in the bicerebellar hemispheres. No risk factors known to be associated with ischemic stroke in young adults were detected. We suspected this ischemic stroke might be related to dupilumab. The administration of dupilumab was discontinued, and he had no recurrence subsequently. IL-4 and IL-13, anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted from T helper 2 cells, suppress proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, dupilumab, a dual inhibitor of IL-4 and IL-13 cytokine signaling, leads to the promotion of coagulation and thrombosis. We speculate that the activation of proinflammatory cytokines in vascular endothelial cells by the inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by dupilumab led to ischemic stroke even at a young age.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104763,,Ischemic stroke; atopic dermatitis; dupilumab; proinflammatory cytokines,Case Reports,United States,eng

There are two types of paroxysmal positional vertigo. One is what DIX and HALLPIKE (1952) call the benign type which is thought to be caused by otolith lesions. Another is a malignant type, in contrast to the former and is related to a lesion in the central nervous system. Otologists are usually familiar with the former, but the latter is not known among neurologists and neurosurgeons. We experienced 37 cases of the malignant type and found that this type of paroxysmal vertigo is induced by various diseases.

32450818,Vestibular migraine with Wallenberg syndrome: a case report.,"Xin, Ying; Fu, Junyi; Xie, Longchang; Yang, Jie; Ke, Guanhao",Xin,"Vestibular migraine, a kind of acute vestibular syndrome, leads to both migraines and vertigo symptoms in a single patient. The occurrence of vestibular migraine has shown an obvious increase in female groups based on age. Though it is recognized that migraines may cause ischemic lesions in some brain regions, the relationship between vestibular migraine and cerebral infarction has seldom been reported, especially with no known research reports about vestibular migraine with Wallenberg syndrome. Based on this, the connection of the two diseases needs to be the focus of more research. The patient, a 35-year-old lady, came to our department with severe vertigo and headaches for approximately two years. She suffered from migraines which attacked about twice yearly for nearly a decade. The diffusive weighted imaging showed a subacute infarction in the right lateral medullar. The clinical characteristics and MRI findings supported the diagnosis of vestibular migraine with Wallenberg syndrome. Along with the normal routine medication for vestibular migraine with Wallenberg syndrome, we also prescribed migraine therapy at the same time. In a 3-month follow-up, the patient had suffered only one vertigo attack and she reported that the migraines were less common and less intense than she was previously experiencing. Due to the fact that vestibular migraine is one of the risk factors of cerebral ischemia, we need to pay more attention to this phenomenon. The current case suggests that both routine medication on ischemic stroke as well as treatment for migraines should be used concurrently in vestibular migraine with Wallenberg syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01786-1,PMC7249651,Case report; Headache; Vertigo; Vestibular migraine; Wallenberg syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

CT angiography revealed bilateral cervical ribs along with bilateral subclavian artery aneurysms. Staged resection of the cervical ribs and reconstruction of the subclavian arteries were performed. Symptomatic arterial thoracic outlet syndrome most commonly presents as arm ischemia because of embolization of intramural clot from a subclavian artery aneurysm or because of thrombosis of the subclavian artery aneurysm itself. In rare cases, the clot can propagate retrograde, resulting in stroke.

MRI suggested involvement of caudal medial vestibular nucleus (MVN); however, the rapid resolution of the nystagmus and improved h-VOR gain favored transient ischemia without infarction. Decreased h-VOR gain is expected with peripheral vestibular lesions within the labyrinth or superior vestibular nerve; less frequently lateral pontine strokes involving the vestibular root entry, the vestibular fascicle, or neurons within the MVN may be responsible. The h-VOR is typically normal in LMS. Clinicopathologic examination of a 61-year-old man with an acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) and left LMS who died 3 weeks after the stroke. Postmortem brainstem analysis was performed. The stroke involved the lateral medulla and pontomedullary junction, near the MVN, sparing the cerebellum and pons. To explain transient vestibular findings there are two possible hypotheses; the first would be that the MVN survived the ischemic process and would be histologically intact, and the second that vestibular afferents in the horizontal semicircular canal were ischemic and recovered after the ischemic process. Neuropathological examination showed a left LMS whose extent matched that seen by imaging. Non-ocular motor signs correlated well with structures affected by the infarction. Neurons and glia within nearby MVN were spared, as predicted by the rapid normalization of the ocular motor signs. Although unlikely, the possibility of transient intralabyrinthine arteriolar ischemia cannot be excluded. Additionally, truncal lateropulsion was due to combined lateral vestibulospinal tract and lateral reticular nucleus infarction. LMS may rarely be associated with an AVS that either represents or mimics a peripheral vestibulopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first neuropathologic examination of the brainstem of an LMS associated with transient vestibular findings occurring in the context of an anterior/posterior (AICA/PICA) cerebellar arterial variant stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2017.00191,PMC5434105,MRI diffusion; head impulse test; lateral medullary infarction; pathology; transient ischemia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Five patients (31%) had an acute auditory syndrome as a prodrome of AICA infarction one to 10 days before onset of other brain stem or cerebellar symptoms. Two types of acute auditory syndrome were found: recurrent transient hearing loss with or without tinnitus (n = 3), and a single episode of prolonged hearing loss with or without tinnitus (n = 2). The episodic symptoms were brief, lasting only minutes. The tinnitus preceding the infarction was identical to the tinnitus experienced at the time of infarction. At the time of infarction, all patients developed hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and ipsilateral hemiataxia. The most commonly affected site was the middle cerebellar peduncle (n = 5). Four of the five patients had incomplete hearing loss and all had absence of vestibular function to caloric stimulation on the affected side. Acute auditory syndrome may be a warning sign of impending pontocerebellar infarction in the distribution of the AICA. The acute auditory syndrome preceding an AICA infarct may result from ischaemia of the inner ear or the vestibulocochlear nerve.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.74.12.1644,PMC1757416,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report here a case of meningioangiomatosis-associated meningioma misdiagnosed as glioma by preoperative radiologic and intraoperative histological examinations. A 50-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of headache and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a round left temporal mass located cortically with hypointensity on T(1)-weighted images and hyperintensity on T(2)-weighted images. In the intraoperative histological examination, a diagnosis of glioma was made based on high cellularity and large tumor cells with nuclear atypia. However, postoperative histological diagnosis of the lesion was meningioangiomatosis-associated meningioma corresponding to World Health Organization (WHO) grade I. A part of the cortical lesion showed the histological features of meningioangiomatosis. Neoplastic cells in the meningioma portion were a transitional variant with immunoreactivity to epithelial membrane antigen and low MIB-1 index, up to 1%. The patient has been followed up for 6 months without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. No tumor recurrence was found during this period. Meningioangiomatosis-associated meningioma might be erroneously interpreted as tumor invasion by those who were not familiar with this condition.

Under the diagnosis of VP, 300 mg oxcarbazepine was administered daily, which relieved the symptoms dramatically. The neurovascular cross-compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve by the contralateral vertebral artery tortuosity can cause VP. Periodic paroxysms of right-beating nystagmus accompanying the left-side tinnitus during vertigo attacks in our patient can be explained by secondary central hyperactivity in both vestibular and cochlear nuclei following long-standing neurovascular cross-compression.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000027815,PMC8589239,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Two patients had acute onset of hearing loss, vertigo, oscillopsia, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed gravity-dependent nystagmus, unilateral hypoactive vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), and hearing loss ipsilateral to the VOR hypofunction. Traditionally, the hypoactive VOR and hearing loss suggest inner-ear dysfunction. Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and nystagmus may suggest peripheral or central vestibulopathy. The gravity-dependent modulation of nystagmus, however, localizes to the posterior cerebellar vermis. Magnetic resonance imaging in our patients revealed acute cerebellar infarct affecting posterior cerebellar vermis, in the vascular distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). This lesion explains the gravity-dependent nystagmus, nausea, and vomiting. Acute onset of unilateral hearing loss and VOR hypofunction could be the manifestation of inner-ear ischemic injury secondary to the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) compromise. In cases of combined AICA and PICA infarction, the symptoms of peripheral vestibulopathy might masquerade the central vestibular syndrome and harbor a cerebellar stroke.

Conversely, loss of consciousness due to anterior circulation involvement (e.g., middle cerebral artery [MCA]) is a rare occurrence in TIA. This report describes a rare case in a 59-year-old woman who experienced recurrent episodes of altered consciousness because of the occlusion or stenosis of her MCAs. The diagnosis of the case was updated from TIA to acute cerebral infarction, finally. Following initial loss of consciousness, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any evidence of acute cerebral infarction. However, following the second and third episodes of unconsciousness, the MRI revealed multiple new acute cerebral infarcts affecting both the cerebral hemispheres. Further evaluation through digital subtraction angiography disclosed complete occlusion of the left MCA and severe stenosis of the right MCA. Early in her illness, the patient was treated with vasodilators, aspirin and atorvastatin. Finally, 2 stents in her right and left MCAs were placed respectively, followed by treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, and double-dosed atorvastatin calcium. Meanwhile, the patient focused on avoiding conditions which may lead to dehydration in her daily life routine. The episodes of unconsciousness of this patient were completely resolved. During the 1-year postoperative follow-up, the patient remained clinically stable without any symptoms of unconsciousness, limb numbness or weakness, or dizziness. These findings suggested that hypoperfusion in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres played a pivotal role in precipitating the patient episodes of unconsciousness. This case underscores the possibility that occlusion or severe stenosis in both MCAs can contribute to recurrent episodes of unconsciousness due to hypoperfusion. Moreover, it emphasizes the association between these episodes of unconsciousness and an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000037343,PMC10919491,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here, we present a rare case of a brainstem cavernoma that was surgically resected whereafter an upbeat nystagmus presented postoperatively. A 42-year old man presented with sudden-onset nausea, vomiting, vertigo, blurred vision, marked imbalance and difficulty swallowing. Neurological evaluation showed bilateral ataxia, generalized hyperreflexia with left-sided predominance, predominantly horizontal gaze evoked nystagmus on right and left gaze, slight left labial asymmetry, uvula deviation to the right, and tongue deviation to the left. MRI demonstrated a 13-mm cavernoma with haemorrhage and oedema in the medulla oblongata. Surgery was performed via a minimal-invasive, midline approach. Complete excision was confirmed on postoperative MRI. The patient recovered well and became almost neurologically intact. However, he complained of mainly vertical oscillopsia. The videonystagmography revealed a new-onset spontaneous upbeat nystagmus in all gaze directions, not suppressed by fixation. An injury of the rarely described intercalatus nucleus/nucleus of Roller is thought to be the cause. Upbeat nystagmus can be related to several lesions of the brainstem, including the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the pons, and the dorsal medulla.

In rim-enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, this technique can assist in the differentiation of demyelinating disease from tumor or abscess. Diffusion tensor imaging characteristics of tuberculoma have not been previously reported to our knowledge. A patient with headaches, dizziness, and mild left-sided weakness underwent MRI with diffusion tensor imaging. A large, rim-enhancing lesion within the pons was discovered, which subsequently was diagnosed as tuberculoma. Tractography maps prepared from diffusion tensor imaging data revealed predominantly displaced descending fiber tracts in the region of the rim-enhancing lesion. A few tracts adjacent to the lesion appeared truncated, and this abnormal finding correlated to the patient's clinical deficit. The tractography characteristics of diffusion tensor imaging in this patient potentially are distinct from those seen with demyelinating lesions, which may show more extensive tract truncation. Together with the consonance of exam findings and tract truncation seen in this patient, tractography may prove useful in the diagnosis of suspected tuberculoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2013.01.003,,CNS infection; DTI; Diffusion tensor imaging; Tractography; Tuberculoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

These events are a significant cause of stroke related morbidity, particularly in young people. Only a handful of cases of golf-induced vertebral artery dissection (VAD) have been described, and the discussion has primarily focused on middle-aged men. Despite the discussion focused on this demographic, women are participating in golf at higher rates than ever before, and have a higher risk for developing VAD. A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital with sharp neck pain, dizziness, and ptosis after swinging a driver during a morning round of golf. Imaging demonstrated a right V3/V4 VAD and subsequent ischemic infarction. After administration of tissue plasminogen activator she had abrupt change in mental status with seizure-like activity. She underwent angiogram and mechanical thrombectomy, and was started in heparin 24 hours post-tissue plasminogen activator. This was subsequently changed to low-dose aspirin following thalamic petechial hemorrhage. She was discharged from the hospital after a few days with only minor deficits. We will discuss mechanism, treatment, and outcomes of VAD in context of this case. This patient is the first woman in the literature to suffer from VAD as a result of playing golf. The twisting motion of the head and neck in a golf swing may be a risk factor for dissection and subsequent development of stroke. As a result of increased female participation in golf, we expect to see increased incidence of women presenting with ""golfer's stroke"" in coming years.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000325,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report a woman with sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. This case suggests that even in the absence of brainstem or cerebellar signs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) should be performed since such studies may reveal signs of life-threatening vertebrobasilar artery occlusion. A 73-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation who suffered bilateral deafness with vertigo and vomiting was transferred from a local hospital to our department. On admission her consciousness was clear and vertigo was absent. Neurological examination revealed only bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Head computed tomography (CT) returned no significant findings. The next morning she gradually developed severe drowsiness. Diffusion-weighted MRI demonstrated acute cerebral infarction in the brainstem and bilateral cerebellum; MRA showed basilar artery occlusion due to a cardioembolic thrombus. Revascularization was obtained by endovascular treatment. However, her condition worsened progressively during the following hours. CT revealed new brainstem lesions, massive cerebellar swelling, and obstructive hydrocephalus. She died on the second day after her admission. When hearing loss is due to vertebrobasilar occlusive disease, the prognosis is very poor.

Posturography testing showed that five patients showed abnormally large body sway induced by full field visual motion stimulation. This group included the two patients with CNS disease and four with strabismic symptoms (diplopia, squint surgery, and ocular muscle weakness). It is concluded that visual vertigo is a heterogeneous syndrome with peripheral or central aetiologies and may occur if patients with balance disorders show high visual field dependence.

In this patient, clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with APVS. Considering the simultaneous onset of acute silent infarcts on brain MRI, the definite cardioembolic source with atrial fibrillation, and the episodic transient vertigo attacks before APVS, we speculate that small emboli arising from the heart may have lodged selectively in the anterior vestibular artery, producing APVS.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2006.12.015,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Her symptoms included a progressive 11-month history of vertigo, gait ataxia, and right thalamic stroke. A diagnosis of CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease was made following open dural biopsy, and later confirmed on autopsy studies. The autopsy demonstrated widespread dural infiltration by inflammatory cells, principally large histiocytes, many of which exhibited emperipolesis, a characteristic finding in Rosai-Dorfman disease. A second pathological finding on autopsy was the presence of multiple demyelinating plaques (with preservation of axons), located in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and multiple brainstem segments. These were consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This case description serves to remind clinicians that CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease—although uncommon—may present as a focal, dural-based, hemispheric mass lesion, or as diffuse pachymeningeal inflammation. Our case was also unusual due to the co-existence of CNS Rosai-Dorfman disease, multiple sclerosis, and polycythemia vera (all rare diseases) in a single patient.

6599230,Role of the visceral brain in body equilibrium.,"Hinoki, M",Hinoki,"A series of examinations were carried out to determine whether the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nucleus, participates in the production of disequilibrium of the eyes and the body and to clarify the conditions which induce disequilibrium. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's hippocampus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in this part of the brain, through which dysfunction of equilibrium center in the brain stem is eventually brought about. This dysfunction leads to disequilibrium of the eyes and the body. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for neurotic vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that in a certain group of traumatized patients who suffer from vertigo of psychosomatic origin, there are two etiological factors: functional linkage between the temporal cortex and the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus in regard to a memory or a conditioned reflex relevant to vertigo, over-excitation of the adrenergic components involved in the brain connecting the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and equilibrium centers in the brain stem. These two etiological factors induce disequilibrium by a trigger-and-target relationship in which the former acts as a trigger and the latter as a target. The cerebellum is not an essential factor in producing vertigo of psychosomatic origin, but it enhances vertigo of this type through activation of the adrenergic components, particularly those in the hippocampus. Thus, in patients with both vertigo of psychosomatic origin and cerebellar symptoms recovery from vertigo tends to be delayed. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's amygdaloid nucleus, particularly its medial portion and the habenular nucleus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in these parts of the brain. These animals develop disequilibrium of the eyes in response to an olfactory stimulus, such as extract of garlic. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for olfactory vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that traumatized patients who suffered from vertigo due to inhalation of garlic vapor showed hyper-reactivity to adrenaline and developed disequilibrium of the eyes and the body when given a subcutaneous injection of this drug. These findings indicate that olfactory vertigo is induced by a mechanism in which olfactory stimulation affects the above adrenergic components, causing disequilibrium of the eyes and the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",{},,Acta oto-laryngologica.

We have presented and discussed 2 novel and challenging cases of CLIPPERS syndrome to highlight the clinical and radiological diversity of the syndrome. The first case was of a 66-year-old male patient who had presented with dizziness, headaches, gait disturbances, mild cognitive impairment, and visual field loss to the left side. MRI revealed 1 cerebellar and 2 occipital contrast-enhancing lesions that were suspicious for intracerebral metastases. The second case was of a 53-year-old male patient who had presented with temporal lobe epilepsy, anomic aphasia, and mild cognitive impairment. MRI demonstrated 4 contrast-enhancing lesions in the pons, temporal lobe, and thalamus that were suspicious for intracerebral lymphoma. Because of the radiological presentation, neoplastic disease was the most plausible diagnosis for both patients. However, repeated biopsies ruled out tumor manifestation, and the findings were finally consistent with CLIPPERS syndrome. The significant and long-lasting response to immunosuppressive treatment confirmed the diagnosis. In both cases, the characteristics of CLIPPERS syndrome imitated malignant tumor growth. This scenario can be challenging to clinicians and necessitates inclusion of this neuroinflammatory syndrome in the differential diagnosis of neuro-oncological disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.123,,Biopsy; CLIPPERS; Case series; Pons; Steroids,Case Reports,United States,eng

However, diagnostic doubts arise when faced with cases presenting atypical features of the positional paroxysmal nystagmus as well as the clinical course and disease evolution. A morphological evaluation of inner ear structures via high-resolution magnetic resonance (HR-MR) studies has been performed in 2 patients that did not respond to traditional therapeutic manoeuvres. In 1 patient, a filling defect at the level of the middle portion of the right lateral semicircular canal (LSC) has been demonstrated, while in the second one, a geometric-architectural abnormality - a 'fold' in the LSC - has been observed. HR-MR study of the inner ear offers a meaningful contribution to interpreting the physiopathogenesis of atypical cases of BPPV.

Here we report a case of simultaneous temporal bone infiltrating macro-metastasis and disseminated multi-organ micro-metastases presenting as acute unilateral vestibular syndrome, due to the reawakening of a primary gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. Purpose - Our objective was to identify those pathophysiological steps that may explain the complex process of tumor reawakening, dissemination. The possible causes of vestibular asymmetry were also traced. A 56-year-old male patient's interdisciplinary medical data had been retrospectively analyzed. Original clinical and pathological results have been collected and thoroughly reevaluated, then new histological staining and immunohistochemistry methods have been added to the diagnostic pool. During the autopsy the cerebrum and cerebellum was edematous. The apex of the left petrous bone was infiltrated and destructed by a tumor mass of 2x2 cm in size. Histological reexamination of the original gastric resection specimen slides revealed focal submucosal tumorous infiltration with a vascular invasion. By immunohistochemistry mainly single infiltrating tumor cells were observed with Cytokeratin 7 and Vimentin positivity and partial loss of E-cadherin staining. The subsequent histological examination of necropsy tissue specimens confirmed the disseminated, multi-organ microscopic tumorous invasion. Discussion - It has been recently reported that the expression of Vimentin and the loss of E-cadherin is significantly associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular and neural invasion and undifferentiated type with p<0.05 significance. As our patient was middle aged and had no immune-deficiency, the promoting factor of the reawakening of the primary GC malignant disease after a 9-year-long period of dormancy remained undiscovered. The organ-specific tropism explained by the ""seed and soil"" theory was unexpected, due to rare occurrence of gastric cancer to metastasize in the meninges given that only a minority of these cells would be capable of crossing the blood brain barrier. Patients with past malignancies and new onset of neurological symptoms should alert the physician to central nervous system involvement, and the appropriate, targeted diagnostic and therapeutic work-up should be established immediately. Targeted staining with specific antibodies is recommended. Recent studies on cell lines indicate that metformin strongly inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer cells. Therefore, further studies need to be performed on cases positive for epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",{},,Ideggyogyaszati szemle,10.18071/isz.73.0354,,acute vestibular syndrome; carcinomatous meningitis; epithelial mesenchymal transition; signet ring cell carcinoma,Case Reports,Hungary,eng

Only a few case reports exist describing this rare cause of cerebrovascular accident due to low circulating levels of oxygen. To the best of our knowledge, we believe we have described here the first patient presenting with an ischemic stroke secondary to severe anemia without an obvious source of blood loss, evidence of thrombus formation, or associated thrombocytosis. A 28-year-old man presented to our institution, complaining of severe fatigue and was admitted under the pretext of dizziness, blurred vision, esotropia, diffuse retinal hemorrhage, and Roth spots found in the left eye. Laboratory investigations reported a hemoglobin level of 1.12 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 16,000/ µL (150,000-450,000). Concomitant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a right 4 mm periaqueductal lesion. After several red blood cell transfusions, the patient hereafter underwent an improvement in his clinical symptoms. Given no past medical history of anemia or thrombocytopenia, an extensive workup was prompted, but only microcytic anemia likely due to iron deficiency was found. Regarding a stroke in the young adult population, a differential beyond atherosclerosis and hypertension must be considered. Coagulopathies, vasculitis, sickle cell anemia, cerebral venous thrombosis, cocaine abuse, and systemic hypoperfusion are less common, but well-documented, causes of ischemia. Although infrequently mentioned, we demonstrate here a real possibility of severe iron deficiency anemia causing ischemic stroke in the brainstem of a young man. While a thorough neurologic evaluation is not often considered in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of severe anemia, vigilance regarding focal neurologic deficits should prompt suspicion for ischemic stroke in patients with significantly low hemoglobin levels.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.4218,PMC6506274,iron-deficiency anemia; ischemic stroke; periaqueductal gray,Case Reports,United States,eng

Most cases occur in immunocompromised patients with invasive fungal disease, most commonly originating in the paranasal sinuses or the lungs. Granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis, which is extremely rare in North America, has been reported to affect immunocompetent patients in most cases, and its causative strain has potential to invade the intracranial arteries. We present a rare case of basilar artery rupture and infarction secondary to granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis. A 50-year-old man in Florida presented with ischemic symptoms and a 6-month history of headache, dizziness, and falls. After biopsy, the patient developed subarachnoid hemorrhage and thrombosis. Several thrombectomy attempts were performed, resulting in persistent occlusion of the basilar artery and subsequent comatous state. After discussion with the patient's family, compassionate weaning and autopsy were authorized. Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is more frequent nowadays owing to increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. However, it is still a disease that mostly affects immunocompromised patients. The development of new microbiologic investigation techniques has enabled the discovery of fungal diseases that can also affect immunocompetent hosts, such as granulomatous invasive rhinosinusitis.

All four cases (two men and two women, aged 52-80 years; mean age, 67 years) had a floating sensation or vertigo at the onset of their disease. Initially, these patients were given a diagnosis of cerebellar infarction or cavernous angioma, or had faint abnormalities in the cerebellum that were overlooked. These patients were followed up for 2-14 months (mean, 6 months), and the tumor was detected when their clinical symptoms deteriorated. The tumor was located in the hemisphere in one patient and in the vermis in three patients. MRI revealed ring-like enhancement in two patients and nodular enhancement in two patients. All patients underwent subtotal tumor resection, followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy. However, three patients died at 16 to 44 months (mean, 28 months), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dissemination was observed in three patients. Two cases were classified as WHO grade III and two as WHO grade IV. The pathological features were typical of malignant glioma, partially presenting the features of low-grade glioma, such as pilocytic, astrocytic, or oligodendroglial components. Nuclear pleomorphism and vascular endothelial proliferation were prominent, and micronecrosis was relatively less evident. The MIB-1 index was 12%-40%, and most of the patients were p53 protein positive. At the onset of cerebellar malignant glioma, diagnostic imaging shows few signs of brain tumor. Thereafter, tumors grow in a short period of time, following a rapid clinical course. Because cerebellar malignant glioma is a rare disease, it is difficult to differentiate it from metastatic brain tumors and primary central nervous system lymphoma by preoperative imaging. Some patho logical features suggesting malignant transformation from low-grade glioma were detected.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Brain tumor pathology,10.1007/s10014-009-0248-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

Vestibular dysfunction contributes, for example, to spatial neglect which can be transiently improved by caloric stimulation. The exact roles and mechanisms of the vestibular and visual systems for the recovery of neglect are not yet known. Resting-state functional connectivity (fc) magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in a patient with hemispatial neglect during the acute phase and after recovery 6 months later following a right middle cerebral artery infarction before and after caloric vestibular stimulation. Seeds in the vestibular [parietal operculum (OP2)], the parietal [posterior parietal cortex (PPC); 7A, hIP3], and the visual cortex (VC) were used for the analysis. During the acute stage after caloric stimulation the fc of the right OP2 to the left OP2, the anterior cingulum, and the para/hippocampus was increased bilaterally (i.e., the vestibular network), while the interhemispheric fc was reduced between homologous regions in the VC. After 6 months, similar fc increases in the vestibular network were found without stimulation. In addition, fc increases of the OP2 to the PPC and the VC were seen; interhemispherically this was true for both PPCs and for the right PPC to both VCs. Improvement of neglect after caloric stimulation in the acute phase was associated with increased fc of vestibular cortex areas in both hemispheres to the para-hippocampus and the dorsal anterior cingulum, but simultaneously with reduced interhemispheric VC connectivity. This disclosed a, to some extent, similar but also distinct short-term mechanism (vestibular stimulation) of an improvement of spatial orientation compared to the long-term recovery of neglect.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2018.00112,PMC5840167,caloric; functional connectivity; neglect; parietal operculum 2; spatial; vestibular; visual,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

BA dysplasia and a PPTA without an obvious AVM or aneurysm possibly leading to cerebellar haemorrhage is rare. PPTA is a relatively common vascular anomaly; hence, we must consider it in the differential diagnosis for brain haemorrhages that may be caused by the specific haemodynamic consequences of PPTA.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2008.03.012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

A retrospective analysis of these patients' records, including vestibular test and eye movement reports, audiograms, questionnaires, and hospital charts was performed. After this review, the nystagmus, initially diagnosed as due to BPPV, was believed to be a manifestation of another disease process in 36 cases. Of the remaining 151 cases, 52 (34%) presented with no significant preceding disorder and have been termed primary BPPV. In the remaining 99 patients we found coexisting or associated disorders which included Meniere's disease, head trauma, prior ear surgery, vestibular neuronitis, migraine, and others. Forty-five of these 151 patients (31%) had an associated diagnosis of Meniere's disease. To our knowledge a significant association between Meniere's disease and BPPV has not been reported. A review of the literature with discussion of BPPV and the associated disorders is offered.",{},,The Laryngoscope,10.1097/00005537-199705000-00010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31284256,"[Susac syndrome, a rare cause of encephalopathy].","Paviolo, Juan Pablo; Aranda Martínez, Agustín",Paviolo,"Susac syndrome is a rare disorder caused by autoimmune-mediated occlusions of microvessels in the brain, retina and inner ear. These occlusions lead to a characteristic clinical triad of central nervous system dysfunction, visual disturbances and vestibule-cochlear deficits. The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and complementary studies, which demonstrate the involvement of three systems. There are different treatments that include various immunosuppressive drugs combinations such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, mycophenolate mofetil, among others. We present the case of a 26-year-old woman with left hearing loss, tinnitus and episodes of recurrent vertigo, four weeks after bilateral blurred vision, cerebellar ataxia and encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple rounded hyperintense lesions in t2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), hypointense in t1, at the middle level of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, cerebellum and right middle cerebellar peduncle. The audiometry evidenced bilateral perceptual hearing loss, predominantly in the left ear. Angiography by optical coherence tomography showed obstruction in the deep layer retina arteries. The Susac syndrome was diagnosed and treatment started with methylprednisolone pulses therapy, intravenously 1000 mg/day for 5 days, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate, which completely reversed the encephalopathy, with persistence of mild ataxia and hearing loss. It is important to know the clinical triad characteristic and the complementary studies necessary to arrive at the diagnosis, since immunosuppressive treatment can often be delayed. Our case had an excellent response to corticosteroids.",{},,Medicina,,,Susac syndrome; encephalopathy; hearing loss; retina,Case Reports,Argentina,spa

Her medical history was remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic stroke in the territory of the left cerebral median artery. Her symptoms were suggestive of a cerebellar stroke. Computed tomography brain scan and neck vessel ultrasounds produced normal findings. A 24-hour blood pressure monitoring showed a reverse dipping pattern. Magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed, showing a hyperintense ischemic focus involving pons and left middle cerebellar peduncle, on T2-weighted images. On Time-of-flight (TOF)-3-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography, there was a marked reduction of basilar artery signal. The digital subtraction angiography showed a vertebrobasilar system anomaly. The right vertebral artery was hypoplastic with few thin terminal spinal branches. The left vertebral artery was vicarious to the right one in intracranial tract. V3 to V4 tract showed multiple atherosclerotic wall irregularities. The basilar common trunk was absent. An abnormal posterior inferior cerebellar artery replaced the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and superior cerebellar artery. Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and superior cerebellar artery arose from ipsilateral V4 tract. This case is the first description of pure basilar agenesia. The symptoms might be related to temporary decrement of the flow in the left vertebral artery. Furthermore, the reverse dipping pattern together with the aging, hypertension, and diabetes had probably contributed to a hemodynamic malfunction of the cerebral vascular system.",{},,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2009.03.009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 56-year-old chimney sweep was referred with recurrent episodes of vertigo and gait ataxia. Left vertebral artery (LVA) flow was barely detectable on duplex Doppler, and brain computed tomography revealed a small infarct in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. Angiography showed subtotal ostial stenosis of the LVA with poor distal flow and possible thrombus. Due to a high risk of distal embolization with percutaneous treatment, anticoagulation was initiated, and the lesion was to be re-evaluated in 2 to 3 weeks. However, 2 days later, the patient developed severe, aggravating headache, gait and left-limb ataxia, horizontal nystagmus, and vomiting. Emergent angiography showed a total ostial LVA occlusion. The PAES was employed to elicit a temporary subclavian steal during percutaneous LVA recanalization, thus protecting the brain from embolization. The ostial LVA was successfully recanalized and stented, with immediate symptom cessation. The PAES can be successfully applied in the subclavian artery to prevent distal embolization during emergent vertebral artery recanalization. Since a significant proportion of vertebral strokes are embolic, PAES may play a novel role in the treatment of acute cerebellar stroke.",{},,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,10.1583/04-1203.1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

We present a patient with nodular infarction who had positional vertigo with nystagmus as a sole manifestation. Video-oculography showed apogeotropic positional horizontal nystagmus during head turning while supine, which was consistent with apogeotropic BPPV involving the horizontal canal.

We identified 27 818 potentially pertinent articles. A detailed review yielded 13 studies for further analysis. Although isolated vertigo has frequently been reported as the only symptom in case series of cerebellar infarcts, only one article discussed its incidence.

A 65-year-old man with atrial fibrillation and hypertension had sudden onset of vertigo, followed by brief loss of consciousness. Three days later a cranial computed tomographic scan showed acute hydrocephalus and low-density areas in the cerebellar vermis on both sides. On transfer the patient showed mild dysarthria, dysequilibrium with retropulsion, symmetrical bilateral horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus on lateral gaze, and marked gait ataxia without brain stem signs, followed by marked vertigo that was induced by motion. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities consistent with fairly symmetrical bilateral cerebellar hemorrhagic infarction that was confined to the territory of the medial branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, in addition to minimal high-intensity areas in the pons on T2-weighted images. The patient improved with conservative therapy, including intravenous administration of glycerol. We speculate that our patient likely had initial transient occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which probably gave rise to the bilateral medial branches of posterior inferior cerebellar arteries. This caused infarction in the territory of the medial branches on both sides without remaining brain stem signs. Such an unusual pattern of cerebellar infarction accompanied by acute hydrocephalus posed a diagnostic challenge at the time of transfer to our care, and correct diagnosis was facilitated by cranial magnetic resonance imaging.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.25.3.686,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
