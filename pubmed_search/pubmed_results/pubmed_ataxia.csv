31648659,A Pacchionian Puzzle.,"Nazir Khan, M; Shaw, Brett H; Wallace, Carla J; Metz, Luanne",Nazir Khan,"A 73-year-old male with a history of chronic ataxia presented with transient facial droop to the Emergency Department. A CT angiogram and MRI with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) were negative for stroke. However, incidental note was made of numerous giant arachnoid granulation pits in the posterior fossa predominantly involving the left occipital bone (Figure 1). These arachnoid pits demonstrated multiple foci of herniation of the adjacent cerebellar parenchyma into the pits with gliosis of the herniated parenchyma and focal encephalomalacia of the subjacent cerebellar parenchyma. Review of bone windows on a remote CT brain performed almost 13 years earlier confirmed this to be a longstanding abnormality (Figure 2). The patient's physical exam was suggestive of cerebellar ataxia with left-sided dysmetria on finger to nose testing and a wide-based unsteady gait.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

28093369,Rehabilitation of the Pontine Ataxia-Dysmetria Syndrome.,"Li, Stephanie; Hartman, Kasondra; Surapaneni, Krishna; Altschuler, Eric L",Li,"We present a case of a patient with significant ataxia and dysmetria following a lacunar pontine infarction and review the literature on this uncommon syndrome. The patient had an excellent clinical course with near resolution of symptoms and signs in less than 3 weeks. We illustrate the patient's ataxia and dysmetria with videos and also use the videos to demonstrate and characterize the features of the dysmetria. Interestingly, the characteristics of the dysmetria appear to be different from those seen in patients with dysmetria arising from a cerebellar or thalamic lesion. We discuss the likely neurophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the condition and recovery. Simple noninvasive study of patients with ataxia and dysmetria secondary to a pontine lacunar infarct may be most helpful in elucidating the contribution of pontocerebellar fibers to motor control.

38098127,Emotional dysmetria after cerebellar-pontine stroke: a case report.,"Long, Rebecca M; DuVal, Michèle; Mulvany-Robbins, Bridget; Wagner, Amanda N; Jickling, Glen C",Long,"Pseudobulbar affect, or emotional dysregulation, commonly occurs following stroke. However, it is frequently missed in cases involving the cerebellum, resulting in a lack of treatment, which can directly impact stroke rehabilitation. A 63-year-old Caucasian female with no history of mood disorders presented with gait instability, dysarthria, and right sided hemiplegia, secondary to cerebellar and pontine ischemic stroke from a basilar occlusion. She underwent endovascular therapy and her deficits gradually improved. However during recovery she began to develop uncontrollable tearfulness while retaining insight that her emotional expression was contextually inappropriate. She was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported improvements in her emotional regulation at one year follow up. This case highlights cerebellar injury as a potential cause of poorly regulated emotions, or an emotional dysmetria. The recognition of this disorder in patients with cerebellar or pontine strokes is critical, as untreated pseudobulbar affect can impact future stroke rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04294-1,PMC10722665,Case report; Cerebellum; Depression; Emotional lability; Ischemic stroke; Pseudobulbar affect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We here describe a case of a thrombosed dissecting aneurysm of postero-inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) revealed by a Wallenberg syndrome preceded by headaches. A 23-year-old patient, without neurological or vascular past medical history, was admitted for dizziness preceded by headache. The clinical examination on admission revealed an incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, associating hemiface sensitive deficit, Horner's syndrome, dysmetria and nystagmus. The brain MRI showed a latero-medullary infarct with a homolateral PICA thrombosed dissecting aneurysm. The diagnosis of intracranial dissecting aneurysms needs particular caution because aneurysm sac thrombosis can give false reassurance on angiographic MR sequences. Moreover, the anatomic features of intracranial artery walls make them prone to sub-adventitial dissection and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhages. Therefore, antithrombotic therapy should be used with caution, due to the risk of bleeding in these intracranial dissections.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-05923-1,,Aneurysm sac thrombosis; Arterial intracranial dissection; Dissection aneurysm; Ischemic stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Leukoencephalopathies pose a particular diagnostic problem when they occur in children. To seek associated, non-neurologic signs is of fundamental importance in hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies, because these can help clarify the diagnostic picture. Two new types of leukoencephalopathy have emerged, one classified as ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination, and the other as hypomyelination with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia. Initially described as distinct entities, they were recently brought together in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database under a single code. However, the literature describes only two patients with the characteristics of both these clinical pictures. We present the extended clinical and neuroradiologic follow-up of a patient with ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination, as well as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

We investigated N.M., a person with bilateral amygdala damage and a left thalamic lesion, who was impaired at recognizing fear from facial expressions. N.M. showed an equivalent deficit affecting fear recognition from body postures and emotional sounds. His deficit of fear recognition was not linked to evidence of any problem in recognizing anger (a common feature in other reports), but for his everyday experience of emotion N.M. reported reduced anger and fear compared with neurologically normal controls. These findings show a specific deficit compromising the recognition of the emotion of fear from a wide range of social signals, and suggest a possible relationship of this type of impairment with alterations of emotional experience.",{},,Proceedings.

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome or ataxia may also occur. Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebellum was excluded by normal cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and, most importantly, absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody production. Other causes of ataxia such as other viral infections, other autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic diseases or intoxication were ruled out. The neurological deficits improved rapidly after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. The laboratory and clinical findings as well as the marked improvement after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy suggest a post-infectious, immune-mediated cause of ataxia. This report should make clinicians aware to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential cause of post-infectious neurological deficits with an atypical clinical presentation and to consider high-dose corticosteroid treatment in case that a post-infectious immune-mediated mechanism is assumed.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC infectious diseases,10.1186/s12879-021-05987-y,PMC7988684,COVID-19; Case report; Post-infectious cerebellar ataxia; Post-infectious neurological disease; SARS-CoV-2 infection,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report on a patient with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), who showed injury of the VCT, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This study recruited an 81-year-old male patient presented with quadriparesis due to ICH on both cerebellar hemispheres and 5 control subjects. A patient had the dizziness that was occurred when he moved and the motor weakness in lower limb. The primary and secondary VCTs of a patient with total 25 score of Scale of the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia were reconstructed using DTI. The results of DTI parameters of primary VCT showed that the tract volumes of primary VCT in both hemispheres of a patient showed significant decrease compared to those of control subjects. All of DTI parameters of ipsilateral secondary VCT in left hemisphere of a patient were within the reference range. Additionally, the ipsilateral secondary VCT in right hemisphere and the contralateral secondary VCTs in both hemispheres of a patient were not reconstructed. We suggest that a patient's ataxia appears to be related to injury of the VCT. Therefore, we believe that the current study would be helpful in evaluating and clinical managing patients with ataxia following cerebellar injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuroscience letters,10.1016/j.neulet.2022.136723,,Ataxia; Cerebellum injury; Diffusion tensor imaging; Vestibulocerebellar tract,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Ireland,eng

Neurologic toxicities that result in high morbidity rates and even mortality have emerged as serious complications of ICIs (Johnson et al. in J Immuno Cancer 7(1):134, 2019; Wang et al. in JAMA Oncol 4(12):1721, 2018). Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is common cause of neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome (Sebastian et al. in J Thorac Oncol 14(11):1878-1880, 2019). Nevertheless, the distinction between neurologic iRAEs and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNSs) in patients with SCLC treated by ICIs remains challenging (Williams et al. JAMA Neurol 73(8):928, 2016). As immunotherapy is gradually being applied for the treatment of a large range of solid tumours, the incidence of neurological autoimmune adverse events has increased. Neurologic toxicities that result in high morbidity rates and even mortality have emerged as serious complications of ICIs and have yet to be fully understood. We report a case of an immune induced cerebellar ataxia in a 47 year-old small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma patient undergoing checkpoint blockade by atezolizumab, a programmed cell death-1 ligand (PDL-1) inhibitor. After 4 cycles of immunotherapy, the patient presented with kinetic and static cerebellar syndrome leading to the diagnosis of TRIM9-Abs ICI-related cerebellar irAE. Therapeutic management was discussed in multidisciplinary meetings in the lack of therapeutic guidelines. There was no clinical improvement. Because of high morbidity and no treatment evidence, neurologic symptoms developing under ICI require early diagnosis and may indicate the need for definitive treatment discontinuation.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,10.1007/s11481-021-10026-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This is a case report of a 43-year-old male, who suffered from unusually prolonged severe ataxia and amnesia after having been rescued during the ascent to Mount Everest at 6400 m. MRI of the brain 63 days after the incident showed the typical MH in the corpus callosum, but, in addition, extensive MH were found in the middle cerebellar peduncles.

Two male patients were aged 74 and 64 years at onset. Both had clinical findings consistent with progressive ataxia and palatal tremor and T2 hyperintensity in the bilateral olives on MRI. Pathological findings included bilateral hypertrophic olivary degeneration accompanied by glomeruloid bodies, 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau-positive neuronal inclusions in the olive, and additional tauopathy in the midbrain, pons, and thalamus. Cerebellar cortical degeneration was extensive, but involvement of the dentate was minimal. P62-positive, but tau- and TAR DNA-binding protein 43-negative, inclusions in the cerebellum of 1 case was also a feature.

To define the characteristics of disorders involving both peripheral and central vestibular structures, we classified the combined vestibulopathies into four types according to their vestibular manifestations, and describe a typical case in each subtype. Infarction involving the territory of anterior inferior cerebellar artery is the most common cause of acute unilateral cases, whereas tumors involving the cerebellopontine angle should be of prime suspicion in patients with chronic unilateral ones. Wernicke encephalopathy was most common in patients with acute bilateral combined vestibulopathy while degenerative disorders should be considered in chronic bilateral ones. Since the head impulse test (HIT) is mostly positive in combined vestibulopathy, signs of central vestibular dysfunction other than negative HIT should be sought carefully even in patients with obvious clinical or laboratory features of peripheral vestibulopathy.",{},,Journal of vestibular research : equilibrium & orientation,10.3233/VES-140524,,Vertigo; Wernicke encephalopathy; infarction; tumor; vestibular disorders,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
39088290,Stiff Person Syndrome and GAD Antibody-Spectrum Disorders.,"Dalakas, Marinos C",Dalakas,"Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), originally associated with stiff person syndrome (SPS), define the GAD antibody-spectrum disorders that also include cerebellar ataxia, autoimmune epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), and eye movement disorders, all of which are characterized by autoimmune neuronal excitability. This article elaborates on the diagnostic criteria for SPS and SPS spectrum disorders, highlights disease mimics and misdiagnoses, describes the electrophysiologic mechanisms and underlying autoimmunity of stiffness and spasms, and provides a step-by-step therapeutic scheme. Very-high serum GAD antibody titers are diagnostic for GAD antibody-spectrum disorders and also predict the presence of GAD antibodies in the CSF, increased intrathecal synthesis, and reduced CSF γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels. Low serum GAD antibody titers or the absence of antibodies generates diagnostic challenges that require careful distinction in patients with a variety of painful spasms and stiffness, including functional neurologic disorders. Antibodies against glycine receptors, first found in patients with PERM, are seen in 13% to 15% of patients with SPS, whereas amphiphysin and gephyrin antibodies, seen in 5% of patients with SPS spectrum disorders, predict a paraneoplastic association. GAD-IgG from different SPS spectrum disorders recognizes the same dominant GAD intracellular epitope and, although the pathogenicity is unclear, is an excellent diagnostic marker. The biological basis of muscle stiffness and spasms is related to autoimmune neuronal hyperexcitability caused by impaired reciprocal γ-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABA-ergic) inhibition, which explains the therapeutic response to GABA-enhancing agents and immunotherapies. It is essential to distinguish SPS spectrum disorders from disease mimics to avoid both overdiagnoses and misdiagnoses, considering that SPS is treatable if managed correctly from the outset to prevent disease progression. A step-by-step, combination therapy of GABA-enhancing medications along with immunotherapies ensures prolonged clinical benefits.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000001457,,,Journal Article; Review; Case Reports,United States,eng

Here, we provide a review of the available literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj, covering clinical and paraclinical presentation, tumour association, serological findings, and immunopathogenesis. Review of the peer-reviewed and PubMed-listed English language literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj. In addition, we provide an illustrative report on a new patient with ITPR1-IgG-associated encephalitis with cognitive decline and psychosis. So far, at least 31 patients with serum ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj have been identified (clinical information available for 21). The most common manifestations were ACA, encephalopathy with seizures, myelopathy, and (radiculo)neuropathy, including autonomic neuropathy. In 45% of cases, an underlying tumour was present, making the condition a facultative paraneoplastic neurological disorder. The neurological syndrome preceded tumour diagnosis in all but one case. In most cases, immunotherapy had only moderate or no effect. The association of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj with manifestations other than ACA is corroborated by the case of a 48-year-old woman with high-titre ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj antibodies and rapid cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention and executive function, and psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, investigated here in detail. FDG-PET revealed right-temporal glucose hypermetabolism compatible with limbic encephalitis. Interestingly, ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj mainly belonged to the IgG2 subclass in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in this and further patients, while it was predominantly IgG1 in other patients, including those with more severe outcome, and remained detectable over the entire course of disease. Immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins, was repeatedly followed by partial or complete recovery. Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide was paralleled by relative stabilization, although the patient noted clinical worsening at the end of each treatment cycle. The spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with ITPR1 autoimmunity is broader than initially thought. Immunotherapy may be effective in some cases.

In this article we present, for the first time, the tonsillouveal transaqueductal approach to access a progressively symptomatic cavernoma within the depth of the tegmentum of the mesencephalon. A 52-year-old woman presented with a history of slowly progressive right-sided hemiparesis and ataxia. On magnetic resonance imaging, a relatively large cavernoma involving the tegmentum of the mesencephalon was shown. The sylvian aqueduct was patent and there was no secondary ventriculomegaly. The patient underwent surgery via a suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy. The right tonsillouveal and medullotonsillar spaces were opened to the level of the choroidal point of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery. The tela choroidea was incised from the foramen of Magendie to the telovelar junction. Looking through the aqueduct and at a point 5 mm superior to its inferior inlet, there was a small cherry-like blister protruding into the aqueductal anterior surface. This was used as an entry point to access the cavernoma. The space around the cavernoma was gently dissected and the cavernoma was circumferentially coagulated to shrink it in a concentric manner toward its center. The total removal of the lesion was achieved and the histopathological findings were consistent with a cavernoma. As a result of noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the patient needed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The 1-year postoperative neurological examination was consistent with preoperative findings.

However, it has been reported infrequently.<b>Methods:</b> We report a case of a 55-year-old man who suffered an acute paramedian midbrain infarction presenting with bilateral cerebellar ataxia, bilateral anterior internuclear ophthalmoplegia and unilateral pseudoabducens palsy, which is confirmed as Wernekink commissure syndrome by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We summarized the clinical data of this entity and performed a literature review of 20 previous reports of patients with this syndrome.<b>Results:</b> In combination with previous reports, we found that the most common symptom was bilateral cerebellar ataxia (100%) and other frequent symptoms were oculomotor disorders (81%), delayed palatal myoclonus or tremor (33%) and consciousness dysfunction (33%). Lesions on brain MRI of all patients affected the area of caudal paramedian midbrain (CPM).<b>Conclusion:</b> Bilateral cerebellar ataxia and lesions involved in the area of CPM on MRI are the major features of Wernekink commissure syndrome and should be the necessary conditions of diagnostic criteria. The simultaneous occurrence of bilateral cerebellar ataxia and oculomotor disorders is significant for localization diagnosis. Consciousness dysfunction is also a relatively frequent symptom of this syndrome. Moreover, pseudoabducens palsy might be attributed to a midbrain lesion.

Surprisingly, this led to a clinical picture mimicking a psychogenic disorder. Similar to non-human primates, this case suggests that the human dentate nucleus consists of distinct cognitive and motor domains with additional somatotopical arrangement of the latter.

Her symptoms had been aggravated with the passage of time. On 1-month DTT, the left DRTT, which originated from the left dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, was thinner than the right DRTT. This study demonstrated injury of the DRTT in a patient with tremor and ataxia following mild TBI, using DTT. It is believed that analysis of the DRTT using DTT would be useful in elucidating the cause of post-traumatic abnormal movements.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1075170,,Ataxia; dentato-rubro-thalamic tract; diffusion tensor imaging; mild traumatic brain injury; tremor,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

It is often fatal or severely disabling. PML exclusively happens in the context of cell-mediated immunosuppression. Prior to the era of HIV, PML was mainly confined to patients with haematological malignancies and rheumatological diseases. The HIV epidemic in the early eighties led to massive expansion in the incidence and prevalence of the disease. PML has also been recognised to happen due to treatment with monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab, which is used as a disease-modifying agent for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and other monoclonal antibodies used in dermatological and haematological conditions. The clinical picture is that of cognitive decline, visual disturbance and hemiparesis. The correct clinicoradiological picture combined with demonstrating the JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using PCR (PMR) is enough to establish the diagnosis. Brain biopsy is rarely needed. Immune reconstitution represents the mainstay in the treatment of PML. We present a case of a 47-year-old man who presented with progressive cerebellar ataxia. Investigations confirmed PML. He was found to be HIV positive.

Demographics, MRI findings and tremor evolution in relation to specific therapies were recorded. Five patients (M=1/F=4), age range 29-51 that developed LA/IT associated with a contralateral cortical MRI lesion were identified. LA/IT developed after an average of 3.1years (range 0-8years) from disease onset. The contralateral cortical MRI lesion became visible on average 23.2months before the development of limb ataxia/intention tremor. Central sulcus widening was noted suggesting local atrophy. Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials revealed asymmetric reductions in N20 amplitudes. Abnormalities in latencies and amplitudes were also noted in the posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potentials, ipsilateral to the lesion. Symptomatic therapeutic interventions were only partially beneficial. Limb ataxia/intention tremor can be associated with a demyelinating lesion involving cortical and adjacent subcortical white matter, in the absence of rubro-cerebellar lesions.

Acute reversible cerebellar ataxia with confusion secondary to prolonged metronidazole use has been reported rarely as a cause of encephalopathy in patients with ALD. We describe a decompensated ALD patient with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis associated with hepatolithiasis who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset cerebellar ataxia with dysarthria and mental confusion after prolonged use of metronidazole. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was suggestive of bilateral dentate nuclei hyper intensities on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sections seen classically in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (MIE). Decompensated liver cirrhosis resulted in decreased hepatic clearance and increased cerebrospinal fluid concentration of metronidazole leading to toxicity at a relatively low total cumulative dose of 22 g. Both the clinical symptoms and MRI brain changes were reversed at 7 days and 6 weeks, respectively, after discontinuation of metronidazole. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: A patient with ALD presenting with encephalopathy creates a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician regarding whether to continue metronidazole and treat for hepatic encephalopathy or to suspect for MIE and withhold the drug. Failure to timely discontinue metronidazole may worsen the associated hepatic encephalopathy in these patients. Liver cirrhosis patients have higher mean concentration of metronidazole and its metabolite in the blood, making it necessary to keep the cumulative dose of metronidazole to < 20 g in them.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2016.05.038,,alcoholic liver disease; ataxia; cerebellar; metronidazole-induced encephalopathy; recurrent pyogenic cholangitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

She showed the same leftward deviation when she tried to draw a circle composed of small triangles. Although her line bisection was normal, on an allocentric task of open-triangle cancellation she was most likely to neglect triangles with a left-side opening.

Three patients with Holmes tremor who visited the Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of TCM from August 2018 to April 2021 were retrospectively investigated to summarize their clinical and imaging data. Holmes tremor in two of the three patients was caused by hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and in the third patient induced by hemorrhage due to ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations. HT occurred 1 to 24 months after the primary disease onset and manifested as a tremor in the contralateral limb, mostly in the upper portion. Cranial MRI showed that the lesions involved the thalamus in all three patients. The damaged thalamic nuclei included the ventral anterior nucleus, ventral lateral nucleus and ventromedial lateral nucleus, and the damaged nerve fibers included left thalamocortical tracts in one patient. In the other two patients, the damaged thalamic nuclei included the centromedian and dorsomedial nucleus, and the damaged nerve fibers included left cerebellothalamic and thalamocortical tracts. One patient showed significant improvement after treatment with pramipexole while the other two patients exhibited a poor response, one of whom had no response to the treatment with pramipexole and was only significantly relieved by clonazepam. We used multimodal 3D medical imaging for the first time to analyze the pathogenesis of HT and found that multiple thalamic nuclei were damaged. The damaged nuclei and nerve fiber tracts of two patients were different from those of the third patient, with different clinical manifestations and therapeutic effects.

To date, esotropia has been reported in dogs in association with ipsilateral abducens neuropathy or extraocular myopathy, but not secondary to thalamic lesions. A 7-year-old male neutered Border Collie and a 12-year-old female neutered cross-breed dog were presented with peracute nonprogressive vestibular ataxia. Neurological examination identified right esotropia, nonambulatory tetraparesis, right head tilt, vestibular ataxia and nystagmus. Lesions in both dogs were localized to the vestibular system with thalamic involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain identified a left paramedian thalamic lacunar ischemic infarct in both dogs. Interruption of descending inhibitory pathways that decussate in the subthalamic region and innervate the contralateral motor nucleus of the oculomotor nerve leads to hypertonicity of the medial rectus. These cases indicate that esotropia is a rare but highly localizing sign in dogs with contralateral thalamic infarcts.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,10.1111/jvim.16986,PMC10937505,cerebrovascular accident; motor nucleus of oculomotor nerve; paramedian thalamus; pseudoabducens palsy; thalamic esotropia,Case Reports,United States,eng

We present a clinical case of a unique presentation of AOP infarction associated with paradoxical embolism and highlight the atypical clinical manifestations and challenging diagnosis of this stroke syndrome. A 58-year-old White female with chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis was admitted to our center with a 10-hour course of hypersomnolence and right-sided ataxia. She had normal body temperature, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and heart rate and scored 11 points in the Glasgow Coma Scale and 12 points in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Initial brain computerized tomography scan, electrocardiogram, and thoracic radiography were normal; transcranial Doppler ultrasound showed >50% stenosis at the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, and transthoracic echocardiogram, a patent foramen ovale and thrombus adherent to the hemodialysis catheter. On day 3, she underwent brain magnetic resonance that showed acute ischemic lesions at the paramedian thalami and the superior cerebral peduncles. AOP infarction due to a paradoxical embolism from a patent foramen ovale with a right atrial thrombus was the final diagnosis. AOP infarctions are a rare type of stroke with elusive clinical presentations and frequently, initial imaging assessment is normal.

The clinical and radiological phenotypes of superficial siderosis are known to manifest over long time intervals. In contrast, this study defines the ""acute superficial siderosis syndrome"" and illustrates typical imaging and histopathological findings of this entity. We describe the case of a 61-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with a melanoma metastasis in the right frontal cortex in February 2019. Within a few weeks he developed a progressive syndrome characterized by cerebellar ataxia, gait disturbance, signs of myelopathy, and radiculopathy. MRI revealed ongoing hemorrhage from the metastasis into the lateral ventricle and the subarachnoid space. A semiquantitative assessment of three subsequent MRI within an 8-week period documented the rapid development of superficial siderosis along the surface of the cerebellum, the brain stem, and the lower parts of the supratentorial regions on T2*-weighted sequences. The diagnosis of a superficial siderosis was histopathologically confirmed by identifying iron and hemosiderin deposits on the cortex along with astrogliosis. The recognition of this ""acute superficial siderosis syndrome"" triggered surgical removal of the hemorrhagic metastasis. Based on a single case presentation, we define the ""acute superficial siderosis syndrome"" as a clinical entity and describe the radiological and histopathological characteristics of this entity.

Spontaneous artery dissection causing brain ischemia is rare in all ischemic strokes. However, in young to middle-aged patients with brain ischemia, spontaneous carotid or vertebral artery dissection causing ischemic stroke accounts for 10-25%. A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of left-arm paresthesia and numbness followed by symptoms of vertigo and vomiting. A neurological examination showed left-arm paresthesia, horizontal-rotational nystagmus, and left-side dysmetria according to a finger-to-nose test. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left subclavian artery dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrated hyperintensity in the left medulla oblongata and inferior part of the cerebellum. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Spontaneous artery dissection is an important etiology of ischemic stroke among young patients. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial dissection. Cervical disc disease is a common etiology in a patient with neck and shoulder pain without cause or neurologic symptoms, when cervical MRI is negative, however, spontaneous subclavian artery dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient, especially in a case of younger patient, presents with acute new-onset neck and shoulder pain followed by the onset of neurological symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2017.06.030,,brain infarction; subclavian artery dissection; vertebral artery dissection,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Application of endovascular interventions is limited due to substantial brainstem compression and cranial nerve neuropathy. Combined endovascular exclusion and microsurgical excision provides an approach to treatment of these lesions. A 48-year-old female patient presented with progressive complaints of ataxia, diplopia in left lateral gaze, and dysphagia. Imaging studies (CT, MRI, angiography) revealed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the right vertebral artery and pronounced brainstem compression. The initial phase of treatment involved endovascular occlusion of the vertebral artery and aneurysm trapping that did not lead to changes in the postoperative patient's neurological status. MRI demonstrated complete aneurysm thrombosis and a weak TOF signal in the vertebral artery near the proximal aneurysm neck region. Because of persistent brainstem compression, the patient underwent right suboccipital craniectomy and hemilaminectomy of the CI arch for aneurysm excision one week after endovascular occlusion. After isolating the aneurysmal sac, the vertebral artery was transected, and two small branches extending from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem were also coagulated and transected, followed by aneurysm excision. Numerous vasa vasorum in the wall of the proximal vertebral artery and aneurysm neck were coagulated to stop bleeding. After surgery, the patient developed neurological symptoms (right leg ataxia and dysphagia worsening) due to lateral medullary infarction (confirmed by MRI) that presumably resulted from coagulation of two small perforating branches coming from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem. Recovery of the patient's neurological functions was observed during conservative treatment. The patient was discharged with mild right leg ataxia and preoperative left-sided abducens paresis. Medulla oblongata compression associated with a giant thrombosed aneurysm of the vertebral artery can be eliminated by endovascular trapping followed by surgical excision of the aneurysm.

During this systematic study, we detected severe destruction of the reticular (RT), fasciculosus (FA), ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), ventral posterior lateral (VPL), ventral posterior medial (VPM), cucullar (CU) and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei (MD), the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and inferior nucleus of the pulvinar (PU i) in the SCA2 case, and a severe neuronal loss in the RT, FA, VA and PU i of the SCA3 case.

We describe a patient presenting a left AH following a right pontine infarction. We investigated the ballistic flexion movements of both wrists and the associated agonist and antagonist electromyographic (EMG) activities, before and after addition of inertial loads. At the time of motion analysis, neurological examination showed cerebellar-like dysmetria of the left side but the patient had recovered a normal strength. In the basal state (without addition of loads), movements of the left wrist were hypermetric. The duration of the agonist EMG activity was prolonged and the onset latency of the antagonist EMG activity was not delayed. Moreover, when a mass was added, the hypermetria was unchanged because the patient was unable to adapt appropriately neither the agonist, nor the antagonist EMG activity. We suggest that the hypermetria was due to an imbalance between the duration of the agonist EMG activity (the launching force) and the duration of the antagonist EMG activity (the braking force).",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

Here, we report two cases of CAPNON and present a systematic review of the literature on skull base CAPNONs, to compare CAPNONs with calcified meningiomas. Case 1: A 57-year-old man presented with right-sided lower cranial neuropathies and gait ataxia. He underwent a subtotal resection of a right cerebellopontine angle lesion, with significant improvement of his gait ataxia. However, his cranial neuropathies persisted. Pathological examination of the lesion was diagnostic of CAPNON, with the entrapped nerve fibers identified at the periphery of the lesion, correlating with the patient's cranial neuropathy. Case 2: A 70-year-old man presented with progressive headache, gait difficulty, and cognitive impairment. He underwent a frontotemporal craniotomy for a near-total resection of his right basal frontal CAPNON. He remained neurologically stable 7 years after the initial resection without evidence of disease recurrence. We analyzed 24 reported CAPNONs at the skull base in our systematic review of the literature. Cranial neuropathies were present in 11 (45.8%) patients. Outcomes regarding cranial neuropathies were documented in six patients: two had sacrifice of the nerve function with surgical approaches and four had persistent cranial neuropathies.

Palatal myoclonus is thought to be secondary to delayed hypertrophic degeneration of the bilateral inferior olivary nuclei secondary to involvement of bilateral dentatoolivary tract. We describe a case of a patient with early-onset palatal myoclonus. A 53-year-old Caucasian man with several vascular risk factors presented to our emergency room with slurred speech, double vision, difficulty with swallowing and walking, and rhythmic contractions of the soft palate. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute infarct of the right caudal midbrain and an old infarct of the right medulla. We hypothesize that the cause of early palatal myoclonus in our patient was a two-hit mechanism with degeneration of the right olivary nucleus resulting from prior right medullary lacunar stroke with the new infarct affecting the dentato-rubro-olivary tract on the left side, causing bilateral dysfunction initiating palatal myoclonus. Wernekink commissure syndrome with palatal myoclonus at onset suggests the presence of a prior ischemic insult in the medulla.

Intracranial localization is a rare manifestation of RDD. Only three cases of localization in the posterior fossa have been reported in the literature. The present report describes the first case, to our knowledge, of cerebellar localization of RDD. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our institution with a 5-month history of cerebellar ataxia. Her medical history was unremarkable. The patient was alert and cooperative. No cranial nerve deficits were evident; Romberg positivity to the left side was recorded. No cutaneous abnormalities, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly were revealed by physical examination. Routine hematological and biochemical studies were normal except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which was elevated. Radiologically, the lesion appeared as a well-defined and avascular mass in the right cerebellar lobe. Meningioma was considered the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy with complete excision of the lesion. Microscopic examination of the operative specimen revealed the presence of a mixed cellular population with predominant mature histiocytes. A peculiar feature was the presence of lymphocytes and monocytes within the cytoplasm of histiocytes (emperipolesis). Immunohistochemical study of the histiocytes revealed strong positivity for S-100, CD-68 antigen, and vimentin.

In addition to this hierarchical arrangement, firing rates of motor units fluctuate in unison with nearly no time delay; an observation that has led to the concept of common drive, a basic motoneuronal rule. Although it is established that the cerebellum plays a critical function in motor control, its role in the genesis, triggering, selection, and monitoring of motor-unit firing pattern discharges during isometric tasks is unknown. We applied an electromyographic (EMG) decomposition technique, known as precision decomposition, to accurately identify motor-unit firing times from the EMG signal recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle to unravel the features of motor-unit firings in three patients presenting a unilateral cerebellar stroke and exhibiting an acute cerebellar syndrome. We observed ataxic isometric force during visually guided abduction of the index finger on the affected side. However, the hierarchical response of individual motor units was spared. Furthermore, acute cerebellar ataxia was not associated with a loss of the common drive.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Journal of neurophysiology,10.1152/jn.00268.2006,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng

15128614,The human basis pontis: motor syndromes and topographic organization.,"Schmahmann, Jeremy D; Ko, Ryeowon; MacMore, Jason",Schmahmann,"Clinical-anatomic correlations were performed in 25 patients with focal infarcts in the basilar pons to determine whether pontine lacunar syndromes conform to discrete clinical entities, and whether there is topographic organization of the motor system within the human basis pontis. Twelve clinical signs were scored on a 6-point scale, neuroimaging lesions were mapped and defined with statistical certainty, and structure-function correlation was performed to develop a topographic map of motor function. Clinical findings ranged from major devastation following extensive lesions (pure motor hemiplegia) to incomplete basilar pontine syndrome and restricted deficits after small focal lesions (ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, dysarthria-dysmetria and dysarthria-facial paresis). The syndromes are not absolutely discrete, and are distinguished from each other by the relative degree of involvement of each clinical feature. Structure-function correlations indicate that strength is conveyed by the corticofugal fibres destined for the spinal cord, whereas dysmetria results from lesions involving the neurons of the basilar pons that link the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Facial movement and articulation are localized to rostral and medial basilar pons; hand coordination is medial and ventral in rostral and mid-pons; and arm function is represented ventral and lateral to the hand. Leg coordination is in the caudal half of the pons, with lateral predominance. Swallowing is dependent upon the integrity of a number of regions in the rostral pons. Gait is in medial and lateral locations throughout the rostral- caudal extent of the pons. Dysmetria ipsilateral to the lesion constitutes a disconnection syndrome, as it occurs when the hemipontine lesion is extensive and interrupts pontocerebellar fibres traversing from the opposite, intact side of the pons. The heterogeneity of manifestations reflects the well-organized topography of motor function in the human basis pontis, in agreement with the anatomic organization of the motor corticopontine projections in the monkey. Higher order impairments including motor neglect, paraphasic errors and pathological laughter result from rostral and medial pontine lesions, and may result from disruption of the pontine component of associative corticopontocerebellar circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh138,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This supports the theory that the pathogenesis of CPM is dependent on a relatively hypertonic insult, which may occur independently of sodium abnormalities. CPM can present as isolated gait ataxia. Clinical manifestations of the disorder may show significant improvement despite a dramatic initial presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-009-9241-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
22527626,Exposure of the wide interior of the fourth ventricle without splitting the vermis: importance of cutting procedures for the tela choroidea.,"Matsushima, Toshio; Abe, Hiroshi; Kawashima, Masatou; Inoue, Tooru",Matsushima,"In recent years, new procedures for fourth ventricular surgeries have been developed with good results. In particular, the trans-cerebellomedullary fissure approach, which exposes the fourth ventricle without splitting the inferior vermis, has proven successful. For optimum results, specialized techniques should be employed in order to effectively open the roof of the fourth ventricle and obtain a wide exposure of its interior. These techniques include the following steps: (1) placement of an incision over the teania extending from the foramen of Magendie to the ventricular entrance of the lateral recess; (2) lateral extension of the incision to the roof of the lateral recess to facilitate its exposure; (3) implementation of the same procedure on the contralateral side. Upon completion of these steps, the bilateral cerebellar tonsils can be easily retracted superolaterally; this eventually exposes a wide interior of the ventricle. In order to ensure successful surgeries, explicit and accurate descriptions of technique are vital. In this article, we employ detailed illustrations to precisely demonstrate the operative procedures and techniques for fourth ventricular surgeries.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-012-0384-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The initial left-sided infarct induced right visual neglect, impairment of right-beating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optic ataxia, Gerstmann's syndrome and apraxia. After the right-sided infarct, which occurred six weeks later, bilateral visuo-oculomotor disturbances were observed, including peripheral visual inattention, disorder of visually guided saccades, severe impairment of foveal smooth pursuit and OKN slow phase. The lesion on the left involved the upper part of the angular gyrus and a part of the adjacent superior parietal lobule (SPL). That on the right involved the supramarginal gyrus and extended posteriorly into the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, into both margins of the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and into a small part of the SPL. As the oculomotor deficits and the peripheral visual inattention were bilateral after the second infarct, they probably resulted from the lesion of homologous areas in both cerebral hemispheres. The zone damaged in common included a small part of the SPL, the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, and the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and a small portion of the subcortical white matter. This restricted cerebral zone could therefore, in man, be implicated both in the control of all visually guided eye movements and in visual attention. It is further suggested that two corticofugal pathways are implicated in visually guided saccades, the first arising from the frontal eye fields and projecting directly onto the premotor structures in the brainstem, the second arising from the posterior parietal cortex (probably mainly the intraparietal sulcus adjacent to the angular gyrus) and including a relay in the superior colliculus before reaching the premotor structures. Lastly, the findings support the hypothesis that optic ataxia results from interruption of direct and/or crossed occipitofrontal pathways coursing in the deep white matter of the parietal lobe.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/109.1.81,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It is suspected that ataxia in these cases is due to damage of efferent or afferent pathways of the cerebellum. However, the precise anatomical correlate often remains undefined. We used deterministic diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) tractography to study the anatomical relationship between lesions causing ataxia and efferent cerebellar pathways. Study subjects were six male patients with focal lesions of different etiology (demyelination, hemorrhage, ischemia, neoplasm) outside the cerebellum. Five patients had cerebellar-like ataxia with prominent contralateral upper limb involvement. One patient with an almost midline mesencephalic lesion had a symmetrical ataxic syndrome. We used 3T MRI (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) and DTI tractography (32 directions, StealthViz DTI, Medtronic Navigation, Louisville, USA) to delineate the dentato-rubro-thalamo-cortical tract (DRT). In all patients, tractography demonstrated focal lesions affecting the DRT in different locations. We conclude that in vivo mapping of cerebral pathways using DTI tractography in patients with focal extracerebellar brain lesions may provide direct evidence of circumscribed damage to the DRT, causing unilateral cerebellar-like ataxia. Also, a unilateral mesencephalic lesion at the level of the crossing of the DRT may cause bilateral ataxia.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-014-7503-8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

This tremor is usually related to lesions in the midbrain peduncular region involving the superior cerebellar peduncle, the red nucleus, and possibly the nigrostriatal circuitry. Common etiologies resulting in HT include tumor, ischemia, and demyelination. We report a case of progressive left-sided HT in an otherwise healthy man with additional symptoms of parkinsonism, hypoesthesia, right oculomotor nerve palsy, cognitive dysfunction, and hypersomnolence. Imaging investigations revealed a right-sided thalamic and midbrain glioma. Dopamine transport imaging demonstrated significant dopaminergic denervation in the right caudate and putamen. The degree of striatal dopamine transporter deficiency was more severe than expected in a patient with Parkinson disease. A trial of dopaminergic agent resulted in significant improvement of the tremor and associated symptoms. Interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway can occur in cases of HT because of midbrain peduncular lesion. The striatal dopaminergic function imaging may have a role in assessing presynaptic dopamine dysfunction and guiding treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000201000,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Lengthening of horizontal vectors indicated temporal coupling of the orthogonal components, as occurs in normal oblique saccades.

Outcome measures were Berg Balance Test (BBT), timed unsupported stance, Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), 10-meter walk test (10-MWT), Outpatient Physical Therapy Improvement in Movement Assessment Log (OPTIMAL), transverse abdominis (TrA) thickness, and isometric trunk endurance tests. Performance on the BBT, timed unsupported stance, FAC, 10-MWT, and OPTIMAL each improved after 10 weeks of intervention. In additions, TrA symmetry at rest improved as did right side-bridge endurance time. LT, using BWST and overground walking, and trunk stabilization training may be effective in improving balance, gait, function, and trunk performance in individuals with severe ataxia.

He was presented with a dysarthric speech and chaotic eye movements, identified as opsoclonus. Neurological examination revealed limb and truncal ataxias and an inability to stand unless fully assisted. A chest CT scan revealed a mass at the anterior mediastinum, which suggested paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS). However, an extensive search for anti-neuronal antibodies linked to cerebellar ataxia failed to find any autoantibodies, including cell surface autoantibodies. Subsequently, a total surgical removal of the thymic tumor was performed, leading to marked improvements in his signs and symptoms. The pathological findings by conventional and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed a squamous cell carcinoma of the thymus. Three months after onset his signs and symptoms improved and he was able to walk without support. In contrast to thymomas, PNS is extremely rare in patients with thymic carcinoma. Previous reports have shown that neurological symptoms, similar to opsoclonus or cerebellar ataxia, deteriorated in cases of thymic carcinoma that could not be controlled.

The medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lies in the paramedian portion of the upper brainstem tegmentum, and the lesion in this fasciculus shows specific abnormality of the eye movement pattern which is known as the MLF syndrome. Although the MLF syndrome was reported frequently to be accompanied by varieties of other neurologic deficits according to the lesion extending into the adjacent structures in the brainstem, the combination of MLF syndrome and cerebellar ataxia has attracted less attention of neurologists. Recently we experienced three cases of cerebellar ataxia arisen simultaneously with MLF syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tomography or X-ray computed tomography visualized lacunar lesion(s) in the upper brainstem tegmentum in all of three cases. It was obvious that the lesion included the MLF and caused the MLF syndrome in these cases. It was speculated that ventro-caudal extension of the lesion involved the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle, and was responsible for the association of cerebellar ataxia with MLF syndrome. According to the recent discussion about the feeding arteries in the brainstem, we decided that the damage of the paramedian branches diverging from the basilar tip resulted in the lacunar lesion(s).

6599230,Role of the visceral brain in body equilibrium.,"Hinoki, M",Hinoki,"A series of examinations were carried out to determine whether the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nucleus, participates in the production of disequilibrium of the eyes and the body and to clarify the conditions which induce disequilibrium. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's hippocampus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in this part of the brain, through which dysfunction of equilibrium center in the brain stem is eventually brought about. This dysfunction leads to disequilibrium of the eyes and the body. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for neurotic vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that in a certain group of traumatized patients who suffer from vertigo of psychosomatic origin, there are two etiological factors: functional linkage between the temporal cortex and the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus in regard to a memory or a conditioned reflex relevant to vertigo, over-excitation of the adrenergic components involved in the brain connecting the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and equilibrium centers in the brain stem. These two etiological factors induce disequilibrium by a trigger-and-target relationship in which the former acts as a trigger and the latter as a target. The cerebellum is not an essential factor in producing vertigo of psychosomatic origin, but it enhances vertigo of this type through activation of the adrenergic components, particularly those in the hippocampus. Thus, in patients with both vertigo of psychosomatic origin and cerebellar symptoms recovery from vertigo tends to be delayed. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's amygdaloid nucleus, particularly its medial portion and the habenular nucleus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in these parts of the brain. These animals develop disequilibrium of the eyes in response to an olfactory stimulus, such as extract of garlic. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for olfactory vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that traumatized patients who suffered from vertigo due to inhalation of garlic vapor showed hyper-reactivity to adrenaline and developed disequilibrium of the eyes and the body when given a subcutaneous injection of this drug. These findings indicate that olfactory vertigo is induced by a mechanism in which olfactory stimulation affects the above adrenergic components, causing disequilibrium of the eyes and the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",{},,Acta oto-laryngologica.

Cerebellar ataxia in some patients with LEMS has been suggested to be caused by antibodies to P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). We report herein a patient with subacute CA and LEMS. Cerebellar ataxia appeared 15 months after the occurrence of LEMS, and the onset of CA was thought to be due to serum anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies. The clinical course of this patient was atypical, as follows: (1) LEMS preceded subacute CA, which developed after intracranial aneurysm surgery, (2) no malignancy was detected when both diseases co-existed, (3) symptoms of LEMS did not progress with the onset of CA, and (4) there was a definite improvement in symptoms of CA and (123)I-IMP SPECT imaging findings after steroid administration. In addition, it is remarkable that LEMS became aggravated in electrophysiologic examinations, in contrast to subacute CA. We suggest that these atypical features of subacute CA and the changes in LEMS may be associated with a balance between the amount of serum anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies and the susceptibility of the cerebellum and presynaptic nerve terminals to the antibodies. More cases are needed to investigate the mechanisms involved.

A 76-year-old man (case 1), and a 90-year-old woman (case 2) suddenly developed clumsiness of the left upper extremity. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar ataxia in the left upper extremity in both cases. But, the other abnormal neurological findings, including the muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, and proprioceptive deficit, were not noted. In case 2, cerebellar ataxia disappeared about ten days after the onset of the disease. On the other hand, ataxia of case 1 remained about two months after the disease onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cases 1 and 2, showed small infarcts at the border between the right precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus. In addition, brain MRI of case 1 disclosed another infarcts in the just medial portion of the precentral knob and the centrum semiovale of central region, respectively. It was suggested that the mechanism of cerebellar ataxia caused by infarct in the central region, was not only due to the interruption of two distinctive neuronal pathways, including the corticopontine tract and cerebellothalamocortical tract, but also due to the disturbance of sensory-motor integrity. In conclusion, etiologies of unilateral monoataxia may be heterogeneous. Furthermore, functional outcome may depend on the mechanism of unilateral monoataxia.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
