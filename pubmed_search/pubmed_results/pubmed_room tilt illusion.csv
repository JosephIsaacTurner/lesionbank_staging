33032530,Room tilt illusion and subclavian steal - a case report.,"Arntzen, Kathrine; Alstadhaug, Karl B",Arntzen,"Room tilt illusion (RTI) is a rare symptom of higher vestibular dysfunction, consisting of a transient vertical rotation of the visual scene in the sagittal or coronal plane, most often 90<sup>o</sup> or 180<sup>o</sup>, without any alteration in shape, size and color of objects. A 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease went through an uncomplicated aortobifemoral graft surgery due to aortoiliac occlusive disease. Post-operatively she experienced five episodes, lasting from 10 to 30 min, with RTI; 90<sup>o</sup> forward rotation of the visual scene in the sagittal plane. Work-up revealed subclavian steal grade 3, and transient ischemia of the central vestibular system of the brainstem was the presumed mechanism. The course of episodic RTIs is often benign, but RTI may represent ischemia in the posterior cerebral circulation. Both stroke and otoneurologic workup are recommended. To our knowledge, this is the first case of RTI associated with subclavian steal reported.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01947-2,PMC7545875,Case report; Inverted vision; Room tilt illusion; Stroke; Subclavian steal,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

12782928,Environmental tilt illusion as the only symptom of a thalamic astrocytoma.,"Aldridge, Aric J; Kline, Lanning B; Girkin, Christopher A",Aldridge,"A 14-year-old girl experienced two episodes of environmental tilt illusion. During both episodes, which lasted less than 1 minute, she perceived all objects within view as rotated 45 degrees clockwise. There were no auras, accompanying symptoms, or sequelae. Neuro-ophthalmic examination findings were normal except for a right relative afferent pupil defect (RAPD). Imaging disclosed a cystic mass in the left posterior thalamus with compression of the brachium of the left superior colliculus. Stereotactic biopsy revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. This is the first case documenting environmental tilt illusion as an isolated symptom of a thalamic lesion. Disruption of vestibular connections between the posterior thalamus and the posterior parietal cortex may be the cause of this visual perceptive disorder.",{},,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/00041327-200306000-00008,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
18090565,Room tilt illusion influenced by head position.,"Zhao, Chen; Lu, Shasha; Tajouri, Nadja; Aliferis, Konstantinos; Landis, Theodor; Safran, Avinoam B",Zhao,"After a low brainstem stroke, a 73-year-old man experienced episodes of 90 degrees tilting of the visual environment in the sagittal plane evoked or terminated by voluntarily changing his head position. The episodes ceased 10 days after the stroke. This provocation by head position supports the idea that pathologic visual-vestibular interaction is at the basis of the room tilt illusion.",{},,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0b013e31815bfc02,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
17315106,[Room tilt illusion: a rare symptom of migraine aura].,"López Domínguez, J M; Rojas-Marcos, I; Sanz Fernández, G; Díaz Espejo, C",López Domínguez,"Room tilt illusion is a distorted perception of the spatial distribution of objects due to complex rotations in different planes. This distortion usually occurs in the vertical plane and is usually associated to vertebrobasilar ischemia. The etiology of the phenomenon varies greatly and only rarely corresponds to migraine aura. Since youth, a sixty-year-old woman had frequent episodes of room tilt illusion in the horizontal plane. These lasted from 30 minutes to 2 hours and were always followed by frontal headache fulfilling criteria for migraine (computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) were normal. Visual symptoms and headache disappeared following treatment with flunarizine. Room tilt illusion might be a rare symptom of migraine aura. In this setting a functional depression of neurons from the posterior parietal cortex may occur, possibly mediated by chemical factors.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

12084362,[Room tilt illusion: Report of two cases and terminological review].,"Arjona, A; Fernández-Romero, E",Arjona,"The room tilt illusion is a transient misperception of the visual image as tilted on its side or even upside down; in this case it has been termed acute upside down reversal of vision. We report on two cases of room tilt illusion as manifestation of VIII nerve neuritis (herpes-zoster infection) and cerebellar hemorrhage. Room tilt illusion has been reported in association with vertebrobasilar stroke, migraine, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and labyrinthine disorders. The pathophysiology of this rare visual illusion has been related to a lesion of the visual or vestibulo-otolith pathways. In animals the neurones of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex areas are multisensory. So, they can respond to somatosensory, optokinetic and visual stimuli. In humans the knowledge about vestibular cortex function and localization is less precise than in animals. However, we propose a disorder of multisensorial vestibular cortex, resulting from a lession of vestibular pathways or association cortex, as mechanism of this phenomenon.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
2952677,Isolated environmental tilt associated with lateral medullary compression by dolichoectasia of the vertebral artery. Is there a cause and effect relationship?,"Slavin, M L; LoPinto, R J",Slavin,"An elderly woman with the persistent isolated symptom of monocular and binocular tilting of environmental objects, was found on magnetic resonance imaging to have compression of the lateral medulla by an ectatic vertebral artery. The double Maddox rod test showed no relative torsion of either globe although 5 degrees of right excyclotorsion and left incyclotorsion (rightward ocular counter-rolling) was detected on testing with monocular viewing. There was no accompanying hyperdeviation, nystagmus or other neurologic signs. Symmetrical tilting of each globe associated with head tilt and skew deviation (the ocular tilt reflex) may be caused by lesions involving otolith connections. Isolated environmental tilt may herald the onset of lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg's syndrome), or may be associated with vertebro-basilar insufficiency. Could compression of otolith connections in the medulla cause persistent ocular counter-rolling without accompanying neurologic signs?",{},,Journal of clinical neuro-ophthalmology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
