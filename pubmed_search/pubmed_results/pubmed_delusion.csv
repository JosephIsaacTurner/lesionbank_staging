37794715,The efficacy of vortioxetine for the delusional disorder of cenesthopathy.,"Sato, Shinji; Imai, Koubun",Sato,"Cenesthopathy is a rare syndrome characterized by strange bodily and oral sensations and is classified as a delusional disorder, somatic type, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Cenesthopathy has been considered difficult to treat. However, to improve cenesthopathy, many pharmacotherapeutic options are reported, including antidepressants and antipsychotics. In this case report, vortioxetine significantly alleviated the distress of oral cenesthopathy in a patient with cerebral ischemia and depression without any adverse effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy of vortioxetine in treating cenesthopathy. Though it is unclear why vortioxetine was effective for cenesthopathy in our case, we stated two possibilities for improving his oral cenesthopathy. When treating oral cenesthopathy in elderly patients, clinicians consider to be one of the options to prescribe vortioxetine.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neuropsychopharmacology reports,10.1002/npr2.12384,PMC10932763,cenesthopathy; delusional disorder; norepinephrine; serotonin; vortioxetine,Case Reports,United States,eng

Although it is known that stroke could cause various psychiatric and psychological effects, including depression, anxiety, and aggressiveness, psychotic symptoms, especially delusions, are rather uncommon. The most investigated poststroke delusions are paranoid type, nihilistic, and Fregoli syndrome. We will describe two patients showing delusion symptoms (Cotard-like and erotomanic ones) that occurred after a stroke involving the right temporal lobe, the basal ganglia and insular region, persisting for a long period after the stroke onset. We have, therefore, supposed that the simultaneous involvement of these brain areas could be involved in the neuroanatomical basis of delusions, as also demonstrated by the neurofunctional evaluation.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Applied neuropsychology.

28114093,[Cotard's syndrome: Case report and a brief review of literature].,"Moschopoulos, N P; Kaprinis, S; Nimatoudis, J",Moschopoulos,"The term ""Cotard's syndrome"" is used to describe a number of clinical features, mostly hypochondriac and nihilistic delusions, the most characteristic of which are the ideas ""I am dead"" and ""my internal organs do not exist"". Besides, anxious and depressed mood, delusions of damnation, possession and immortality, suicidal and self-mutilating behavior are included. The first description of the syndrome was made in 1880 by Cotard, who presented the case of a female patient in a lecture. He originally named it ""hypochondriac delusion"", and some years later ""delusion of negations"", while it was named ""Cotard delusion"" after his death. In international literature, the terms ""nihilistic delusion"" and ""Cotard's syndrome"" prevailed over ""delusion of negations"" and ""Cotard delusion"". In the present study we report the case of a 59 year-old woman, who was admitted to our department after a suicide attempt, and who showed symptoms of Cotard's syndrome for about two years, namely depressed mood, hypochondriac and nihilistic delusions, delusions of immortality and damnation, suicidal ideation, severe psychomotor retardation, diminished motivation and tendency to stay in bed. She never took the medication she was prescribed, and at times she refused to eat. During her hospitalization, there was performed a full blood panel and medical imaging, that showed chronic ischemic infarctions, periventricular leukoencephalopathy and diffuse cerebral atrophy in MRI. All the other test results were normal. She was administered treatment with haloperidol, mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Gradually, her psychomotor ability, motivation and mood improved, she didn't express suicidal ideation, her delusions were less intense and she was able to question them, but they weren't eliminated. She was discharged in improved condition, after 44 days. Cotard's syndrome isn't mentioned in the current classification systems (ICD-10, DSM-5). In literature though, it has been divided into three types, according to the clinical symptoms: psychotic depression, Cotard type I, and Cotard type II, and three stages have been proposed: germination stage, blooming stage and chronic stage. It has been associated with various medical conditions, such as cerebral infractions, frontotemporal atrophy, epilepsy, encephalitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, it has been associated with psychiatric conditions, such as mental retardation, postpartum depression, depersonalization disorder, catatonia, Capgras syndrome, Fregoli syndrome, Odysseus syndrome, koro syndrome. Several reports about successful pharmacological treatments have been published, both monotherapies with antidepressants, antipsychotics or lithium, and by antidepressant and antipsychotic combination treatments. The most reported successful treatment strategy for Cotard's syndrome is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), administration of which should follow current treatment guidelines of the underlying conditions.",{},,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,10.22365/jpsych.2016.274.296,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Greece,gre

Somatoparaphrenia (SP), a delusional belief concerning the experienced disownership for the contralesional paralyzed arm, represents the disruption of such mechanism. In two experiments, we have investigated the alteration of limb disownership after spatial manipulations in a right-brain-damaged patient affected by chronic SP. In experiment 1 the patient's spatial attention was switched between the left and right sides of space. SP signs worsened when the patient was interviewed from the left compared to the right bedside. In the second experiment we showed the first systematic transient remission of SP using left caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS), a physiologic manipulation mainly acting on the spatial frame of reference. Taken together, these results shed further light on the spatial nuance of SP and on the importance of vestibular signals for the generation of a coherent body representation. Furthermore, our case study demonstrated the possibility of eliciting more severe SP signs if the patient is interviewed from the left bedside. Additionally, CVS applications may have an important impact on the rehabilitation of these symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2015.1077257,,Somatoparaphrenia; caloric vestibular stimulation; right brain damage; space,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

At first sight, these delusions would seem to have little to do with each other, except that they both involve bizarre claims about existence (for self or others). On closer examination, however, there are other parallels. Here, we summarise similarities in associated impairments of face perception, and argue that both delusions reflect an interaction of impairments at two levels. One set of contributory factors involves perceptual impairment, or anomalous perceptual experience. The other factors lead to an incorrect interpretation of this, for which we offer an explanation in terms of attribution theory. Although the Capgras and Cotard delusions are phenomenally distinct, they may therefore represent attempts to make sense of fundamentally similar experiences.",{},,Psychopathology,10.1159/000284874,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

We report here the first known patient with unilateral right hemisphere lesions and delusions of death (1 of the 2 types of Cotard delusion). This man began to believe that he was dead after suffering a right hemisphere infarction involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as the thalamus. He had delusions of death in the context of both depersonalization/derealization and delusional misidentifications of people and places. Neuropsychological testing revealed left hemispatial neglect and deficits in general attention. The patient's sense of body ownership and face recognition abilities were preserved. This case suggests that abnormal feelings of familiarity, which have been implicated in several delusional misidentification syndromes, contribute significantly to the development of delusions of death.

His delusional symptoms were studied longitudinally and the cognitive impairments associated with delusion were investigated. Data suggest that M.P. did 'perceive' the actual differences between doubles and originals rather than 'confabulate' them. The cognitive profile, characterized by retrograde episodic amnesia, but neither object processing impairment nor confabulations, supports this hypothesis. The study examines the nature of object misidentification based on Ellis' and Staton's account and proposes a new account based on concurrent unbiased retrieval of semantic memory traces and biased recollection of episodic memory traces.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2011.627344,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Adipsic hypernatremia is characterized by autoantibodies against the thirst center of the brain. These autoantibodies cause inflammation and apoptosis in key regions of water homeostasis, leading to lack of thirst and highly increased serum sodium. To date, the symptoms of weakness, fatigue and drowsiness have been associated with adipsic hypernatremia, but no psychiatric symptomatology. Here, we showcase the first description of an adolescent patient, in which severe and complex psychiatric symptoms presented along with adipsic hypernatremia. The patient experienced delusion, hallucinations, restlessness and pronounced depression. Further, he showed ritualized, aggressive, disinhibited and sexualized behavior, as well as self-harm and psychomotor symptoms. Due to his severe condition, he was hospitalized on the emergency unit of the child and adolescent psychiatry for 8 months. Key symptoms of the presented clinical picture are: childhood-onset complex and treatment-resistant psychosis/catatonia, pronounced behavioral problems, fatigue, absent thirst perception, hypernatremia and elevated prolactin levels. This case report renders first evidence speaking for a causal link between the autoimmune adipsic hypernatremia and the psychotic disorder. Moreover, it sheds light on a new form of autoimmune psychosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1206226,PMC10396436,adipsic hypernatremia; autoimmune; case report; catatonia; encephalitis; psychosis; schizophrenia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
31194981,The dynamic nature of the sense of ownership after brain injury. Clues from asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.,"Romano, Daniele; Maravita, Angelo",Romano,"The sense of ownership is the feeling that a body part belongs to ourselves. Brain damage may disrupt this feeling, leading to somatoparaphrenia (SP), i.e., the delusion that one's limbs belong to someone else. This delusional feeling is typically associated with profound motor and somatosensory deficits. We reviewed the cases of SP reported so far in the literature outlining the clinical and neuroanatomical profile of SP. We then investigated and reported three new peculiar cases of SP that allow new insights into the theoretical framework of this neuropsychological condition. We thus propose an innovative theoretical account that integrates previous evidence and the new cases described. We suggest that a defective update of the ongoing dynamic representation of the body finalised to perception and action, may be the key for the disownership feelings of patients with SP. The erroneous spatial representation of the limb contralateral to the lesion would have the logical consequence of delusional misattribution of the seen own arm.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107119,,Body awareness; Body ownership; Body representation; Body schema; Right brain damage; Somatoparaphrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
25886646,Capgras delusion for animals and inanimate objects in Parkinson's Disease: a case report.,"Islam, Lucrezia; Piacentini, Sylvie; Soliveri, Paola; Scarone, Silvio; Gambini, Orsola",Islam,"Capgras delusion is a delusional misidentification syndrome, in which the patient is convinced that someone that is well known to them, usually a close relative, has been replaced by an impostor or double. Although it has been frequently described in psychotic syndromes, including paranoid schizophrenia, over a third of the documented cases of Capgras delusion are observed in patients with organic brain lesions or neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson's Disease. Variants of Capgras involving animals or inanimate objects have also been described. The etiology of Capgras in Parkinson's remains unclear, but may arise from a combination of factors, such as frontal lobe dysfunction and dopaminergic medication. We present the case of a 53-year old right-handed female with Parkinson's disease who developed Capgras delusion during treatment with dopamine agonists and Levodopa/Carbidopa. She became convinced that her pet dogs and the plants in her garden had been substituted by identically looking ones. Our patient was initially treated with Quetiapine, with no improvement, and subsequently treated with Clozapine, which lead to partial regression of her symptoms. Neuropsychological Evaluation showed Mild Cognitive Impairment in Executive Functions. Given the clinical history, onset and evolution of symptoms we believe our patient's delusion resulted from the overlap of dopaminergic medication and Mild Cognitive Impairment in executive functions. Zoocentric Capgras, the variant we describe, has been rarely described in scientific literature, and we believe it is of interest due to its unusual characteristics.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,BMC psychiatry,10.1186/s12888-015-0460-7,PMC4394395,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may be a complication in some neurological diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of subacute psychosis and SIADH as the manifestation of HE, observed in the present case, has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man was hospitalized with a 4-month history of abnormal behaviors, including talkativeness, stopping consumption of coffee and cigarettes, hoarding garbage, and sleep disorders. On physical examination, increased and incoherent speech with flight of idea and delusion were observed. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28/30. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia due to SIADH and a positive result for anti-thyroid and anti-NH2 terminal of alpha-enolase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed only elevation of IL-6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable; however, (I-123)-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed extensive hyperperfusion involving the brainstem and bilateral frontal and medial temporal lobes. Electroencephalography showed generalized slow waves, but there were no epileptiform discharges. After 2 courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, his symptoms improved. Based on the findings of clinical features and steroid responsiveness, he was diagnosed with HE. Oral prednisolone and antipsychotic drugs were decreased without a relapse and he was discharged to his home. CONCLUSIONS Although psychosis complicating SIADH is rare, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis because of its treatment efficacy.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942297,PMC10728882,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It is suggested that a right frontal subcortical lesion alone may be sufficient to cause cognitive disturbance that can develop into reduplicative paramnesia. Clinical data have been scarce. We describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroradiologic findings of a 69-year-old man with reduplicative paramnesia after a right frontal subcortical lesion. Observation and neuropsychological study showed visuospatial impairment, visual-dominant memory disturbance, anosognosia for cognitive disturbance, and mild frontal dysfunction with paranoid personality. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging study showed a lesion localized in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area, and we could define 5 neural pathways involved with the lesion. We supposed that 4 of these were potentially related to reduplicative paramnesia: the medial inferior component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, which are related to visuospatial processing; the anterior thalamic radiation, which is concerned with memory processes; and the uncinate fasciculus, which may be related to abnormal feelings of hyperfamiliarity. A localized lesion in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area can cause cognitive dysfunction that may develop into reduplicative paramnesia.

The previous symptoms were followed by disorientation, persecutory delusion, incoherent language, and tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) with Glasgow score 7. Most of complementary exams (brain CT, brain MRI, blood analysis, PCR for virus on CSF) were normal except CSF leucocytosis and hyperproteinorrhachia. An abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a 5-cm solid-cystic tumor in the left adnexal region, suggestive of teratoma. At that stage, the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and confirmed later. This disease can only be successfully treated with fast surgical intervention and an early implementation of immunosuppressive therapies.

For patients with these symptoms, consultation-liaison psychiatrists may be asked to assist with evaluating the differential diagnosis, assessing safety, and developing treatment options. This study's objective was to solidify current knowledge of the clinical presentations and management of OS through a systematic review of the literature and description of 2 new cases. We conducted a literature search from the start of relevant databases through August 2023 to identify English language case reports of adults (‚â•18 years) with OS that described clinical evaluations, biological treatments, and outcomes. We extracted demographics, proposed etiologies, treatment choices and responses, duration of delusions, comorbid psychiatric symptoms, neuro-radiographic findings, and presence of physical violence. We reported clinical findings for 2 new cases. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we screened 705 abstracts and conducted full-text reviews of 118 articles to identify 73 cases published from 1983 to 2023 meeting inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58.2 years with male predominance (M:F¬†=¬†1.88). Etiologies included primary psychiatric disorders (16, 22%), other medical conditions (38, 52%), and medications or other substances (19, 26%). Delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, and dopaminergic agonists were the most common etiologies, respectively, in these groups. Antipsychotics were the most common treatment (57, 78%). Symptom remission was reported in 51 (70%) cases. The average duration of OS was 39.5 months. Of 32 cases reporting brain imaging insults, 12 of 20 (60%) showed right-sided lesions, and 8 of 20 (40%) showed left-sided lesions, with 9 of 32 (28%) located in the frontal lobes. The most commonly co-existing psychiatric symptom was depression (14, 19%). Violence was reported in 25 cases (34%). Our 2 new cases were consistent with these findings. OS may be a manifestation of several neuropsychiatric conditions, primarily delusional disorder, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's dementia, and the use of dopaminergic agonists. One-third of cases include violent behaviors. It appears to respond to antipsychotic medications, but treatment is delayed more than 3 years on average.

We studied this sense in a somatoparaphrenic patient and three control patients, all with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. We experimentally manipulated the visual perspective (direct- versus mirror-view) and spatial attention (drawn to peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space) in an experiment involving recognising one's own hand. The somatoparaphrenic patient denied limb ownership in all direct view trials, but viewing the hand via a mirror significantly increased ownership. The extent of this increase depended on spatial attention; when attention was drawn to the extrapersonal space (near-the-mirror) the patient showed a near perfect recognition of her arm in the mirror, while when attention was drawn to peripersonal space (near-the-body) the patient recognised her arm in only half the mirror trials. In a supplementary experiment, we used the Rubber Hand Illusion to manipulate the same factors in healthy controls. Ownership of the rubber hand occurred in both direct and mirror view, but shifting attention between peripersonal and extrapersonal space had no effect on rubber-hand ownership. We conclude that the isolation of visual perspectives on the body and the division of attention between two different locations is not sufficient to affect body ownership in healthy individuals and right hemisphere controls. However, in somatoparaphrenia, where first-person body ownership and stimulus-driven attention are impaired by lesions to a right-hemisphere ventral attentional-network, the body can nevertheless be recognised as one's own if perceived in a third-person visual perspective and particularly if top-down, spatial attention is directed away from peripersonal space.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.03.029,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This case study reports the findings of a thorough diagnostic evaluation in a woman suffering from Capgras syndrome and presenting with the following clinical peculiarities: obsessive modality of presentation of the delusional ideation, intrusiveness of such ideation (that even disturbed her sleep), as well as a sense of alienation and utter disgust towards the double. These characteristics bring to mind the typical aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroanatomic investigation, through magnetic resonance imaging, performed on this patient showed alteration of the bilateral semioval centers, which are brain regions associated with the emotion of disgust and often show alterations in subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, neuroimaging allows researchers to put forward the hypothesis of a common neuroanatomic basis for Capgras syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, at least for cases in which the delusional ideation is associated with deep feelings of disgust and presents with a certain pervasiveness.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S47293,PMC3742348,Capgras syndrome; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; obsessive-compulsive disorder; semioval centers,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

Among the various presentation suggestive of panhypopituitarism, psychosis, and features of schizophrenia is very rarely seen. In the majority of cases, neurosurgical intervention for the excision of tumor is considered a standard treatment modality but conservative management with dopamine agonist and steroids have also been shown to provide an optimal level of care also improving the quality of level of patient. A 42-year-old Asian male presented with a history of talking to self, delusion of persecution, over talkativeness, hallucination, increased suspiciousness, and history of lost and found in the streets where he was working as a migrant worker. The patient was initially managed in line of schizophrenia with the antipsychotics drug of choice. On further assessment there was no improvement of psychiatric symptoms but they further deteriorated with additional neuropsychiatric symptoms; hence, MRI brain was carried out. Following which, the diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma was confirmed and further more hormonal analysis was done, which showed findings suggestive of panhypopituitarism. The patient was then managed conservatively with dopamine agonist and steroids, which showed rapid improvement of psychiatric symptoms with a massive reduction in the size of the pituitary macroadenoma. With the incidence of 100 per million cases pituitary adenomas are considered locally invading with the characteristic compression of the surrounding structure, presenting as visual hallucinations, olfactory hallucinations, episodes of losing time, apathy, and features suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and symptoms secondary to hormonal imbalance such as hypothyroidism. Psychiatric symptomatic presentations are considered a very rare presentation in cases of pituitary macroadenoma. Also, psychiatric features and symptoms of psychosis are associated with prolcatinomas through idiopathic mechanism and the basic casualty has not been established. Surgical intervention such as trans-sphenoidal resection of the mass can be undertaken in case where mass effects is present but long-term remission and prognosis is found not to be fruitful. Conservative treatment with dopamine agonist such as cabergoline and steroids also plays a meaningful role in abrupt management in such cases. Pituitary macroadenoma presenting as a patient of schizophrenia is noted very rarely in medical literature; hence, investigations in view of neurosurgical diagnosis in cases presenting as psychosis should be considered for ideal holistic management. Conservative management can also be a breakthrough treatment modality in complete recovery of pituitary macroadenoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1097/MS9.0000000000001413,PMC10718332,case report; pituitary macroadenoma; prolactinoma; schizophrenia,Case Reports,England,eng

Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole.

Although several prior case studies have described outcome following acute onset of HSVE, this case presents a unique challenge for rehabilitation in several respects. First, EB's pre-morbid history is complicated; in contrast with prior HSVE case studies that have typically involved individuals with a relatively high level of pre-morbid functioning, EB presents with limited educational attainment and a prior history of several incarcerations for violent offenses. Post-injury, his presentation includes significant verbal aggression, threats of harm toward others, physical posturing and occasional physical aggression toward his caretakers. Third, EB presents with a fixed delusion that others are constantly taking advantage of him. These features are present in the context of global amnesia and relatively intact cognitive functioning in other domains. Following a brief review of prior HSVE case studies, this study reviews the outcomes of various pharmacological, cognitive, behavioural and integrative interventions designed for management of EB's aggression and agitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2014.954623,,Aggression; amnesia; encephalitis; neuropsychological; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

38292959,Mortality Due to Complications Associated With Acute Ogilvie's Syndrome in an Older Adult Treated for Psychosis: A Case Report.,"Ali, Maryam M; Al Saeed, Mahmood; Ebrahim, Mohamed; Mandeel, Fatima",Ali,"Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome is a disorder causing massive colonic dilation with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. The actual incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is unclear; However, electrolyte imbalance, psychiatric disorders, the use of medications such as anticholinergics or antipsychotics, and recent abdominal surgery are the most common predisposing factors associated with this syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome is most likely caused due to impairment of the gut's motor system and an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system including a reduction in the activity of stimulatory neurotransmitters. The predisposition to psychotic disorders could be, in some instances, due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the brain and the gut's autonomic nervous system. The symptoms of Ogilvie's syndrome are similar to mechanical obstruction of the colon but no physical cause of obstruction is usually present. Ogilvie's syndrome can be managed conservatively; however, if left untreated, Ogilvie's syndrome can lead to bowel perforation, which is associated with a high mortality risk. Antipsychotics have been considered the cornerstone treatment for psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Even though they are highly effective in treating psychiatric illnesses, their usage carries multiple risks. Overall, constipation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications with some classes posing more risk than others. Constipation can be severe and may lead to serious complications such as paralytic ileus, bowel ischemia, and death. We present here a case of delusional disorder managed with risperidone and complicated by intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This case reiterates the need to consider all complications of antipsychotic medications, even rare ones, and include them in the discussion with patients and their caregivers before commencement.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.51389,PMC10825385,acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction; antipsychotics; delusional disorder.; intestinal obstruction; intestinal perforation; ogilvie's syndrome,Case Reports,United States,eng

SPECT scan showed marked hypoperfusion in the right parietotemporal cortex and this extended to the associative cortex in the right frontal regions. The persistence of anosognosia in this patient cannot be explained by memory impairments or global cognitive decline.

Although a large number of neuroimaging studies have been published, a relatively small amount of neuropsychological evidence supports involvement of the medial PFC in theory of mind reasoning. We recruited two neurological cases with damage to the medial PFC and initially performed the standard neuropsychological assessments for intelligence, memory, and executive functions. To examine theory of mind performance in these two cases, four kinds of standard and advanced tests for theory of mind were used, including first- and second-order false belief tests, the strange stories test, and the faux pas recognition test. Both patients were also requested to complete the questionnaire for the autism-spectrum quotient. Neither case showed impairment on standard theory of mind tests and only mild impairments were seen on advanced theory of mind tests. This pattern of results is basically consistent with previous studies. The most interesting finding was that both cases showed personality changes after surgical operations, leading to characteristics of autism showing a lack of social interaction in everyday life. We discuss herein the possible roles of the medial PFC and emphasize the importance of using multiple approaches to understand the mechanisms of theory of mind and medial prefrontal functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Social neuroscience,10.1080/17470910902990584,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This study investigated the role of personal biases in the confabulations of six patients with diverse aetiologies. Confabulations were elicited with a series of structured interviews. We then compared the patients' confabulations to their actual situations. Further analyses compared confabulations about current (i.e., the postmorbid period) and past (i.e., premorbid events and general life circumstances) events. Group analysis confirmed a general bias to recall events that were more positive than the reality. However, examination of individual cases revealed that positive biases were not universal. Confabulations about current circumstances showed the positive bias, whereas an emotional bias was not evident in past confabulations. We conclude that motivational forces play a role in determining the content of confabulations but conceive of this role primarily in terms of a need to maintain a consistent self-concept (whether positive or negative) overlaid upon the ease with which an individual can retrieve familiar premorbid daily activities and routines.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,10.1080/13546800902767703,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Individuals with this condition hold the fixed and false belief that their body or their environment is infested with parasites, insects or other organisms.

Single case experimental design methodology was employed to evaluate the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for delusional infestation in a 70-year-old male who was intolerant of anti-psychotic medication. 'Tom' had a large, mature infarct in the middle cerebral artery territory as well as a left posterior parietal infarct post-stroke, which may have precipitated his symptoms. After a baseline period of 3 weeks, Tom received eight sessions of CBT based on the model by Collerton and Dudley (2004). Post-intervention, there was a reliable improvement on clinical measures as well as a large reduction in distress levels, which was maintained at 3-month follow-up. The conviction in the belief that the infestation was real did not shift. This case demonstrated the potential for the use of CBT to address distress related to delusional infestation.

Insights from a single case study"".","Salvato, Gerardo; Gandola, Martina; Veronelli, Laura; Berlingeri, Manuela; Corbo, Massimo; Bottini, Gabriella",Salvato,"The vestibular system plays a pivotal role in behavioural and physiological aspects of body representation. If on the one hand, the stimulation of the vestibular system in healthy subjects provokes body representation distortions, accompanied by a decrease of body temperature, on the other hand, in brain-damaged patients it transiently restores body representation disorders. So far, the physiological counterpart of such behavioural amelioration on patients has never been explored.

It has been described mainly in moderate or severe dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. In the few reported cases without global cognitive impairment, right hemispheric and frontal dysfunctions have been described. We report a 90-year-old man with abrupt onset of the mirror sign after a minor right hemispheric ischemic stroke. Neuropsychological testing revealed preserved cognitive capacities, except for mild to moderate impairment of visuospatial skills, suggesting right hemisphere dysfunction. Neuroimaging showed a small right dorsolateral frontal infarct, and bifrontal encephalomalacia, consistent with a past history of head trauma. Scattered ischemic white matter lesions in posterior periventricular regions were also seen. It seems that the mirror sign is a multifactorial phenomenon that usually requires right hemispheric dysfunction (perceptual abnormalities, loss of familiarity) and frontal damage (loss of judgement and inability to correct wrong beliefs).

This hypothesis has not previously been tested directly. We report here an investigation of attributional style in a 24-year-old woman with Cotard delusion (""LU""). LU's attributional style (and that of ten healthy control participants) was assessed using the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (Kinderman, P., & Bentall, R. P. (1996). A new measure of causal locus: the internal, personal and situational attributions questionnaire. Personality and Individual Differences, 20(2), 261-264.). LU showed a significantly greater proportion of internalising attributions than the control group, both overall and for negative events specifically. The results obtained thus support an association of Cotard delusion with an internalising attributional style, and are therefore consistent with the account of Young and colleagues.

For many years CW stated several times a day that he had just woken up. He frequently wrote this in his diary too.

Few reports have described patients with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis, and no cases of psychosis associated with this encephalitis have been reported. We report a patient with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis with Cotard and Capgras delusions who was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The patient was a 25-year-old woman. She exhibited disorientation, executive function deficits, tremors in the upper limbs, generalized athetoid-like involuntary movements, hallucinations, incontinence, and fever, which led to her admission to our hospital. Upon admission, she complained of Cotard delusions. Various diagnostic tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, antibody screening, and brain imaging, were unremarkable, except for positivity for serum anti-recoverin antibodies, non-specific general slowing on electroencephalography and decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the frontal and occipital lobes, and increased rCBF in the basal ganglia and pons on single-photon emission computed tomography. She was eventually diagnosed with encephalitis positive for anti-recoverin antibodies and treated with immunoglobulins and steroids. Her neurological symptoms improved temporarily, but three months later, psychiatric symptoms, i.e., suicidal thoughts and Cotard and Capgras delusions, were exaggerated. After ECT, her condition significantly improved. In conclusion, the present report suggests that pineal gland dysfunction due to anti-recoverin antibody or its cross-reactivity with neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins may contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis and that ECT can be a viable treatment option if immunotherapy proves ineffective. Additionally, decreased rCBF in the prefrontal cortex may be associated with the clinical features of Capgras and Cotard delusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1330745,PMC10850254,Capgras delusion; Cotard delusion; ECT; anti-recoverin antibody; case report; encephalitis; rCBF,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A 24-year-old patient experienced seizures involving vivid mental imagery of biomechanically impossible movements of the upper limb. A right precentral low-grade glioma was diagnosed. Awake surgery with intraoperative electrostimulation sensorimotor mapping was performed. Remarkably, the same mental representations of biomechanically impossible movements of the left upper limb were repeatedly elicited during stimulation of the central cortex. These eloquent areas were preserved, even though the precentral part of the knob of the hand was removed. After a transient monoplegia, the patient recovered and resumed a normal life which included playing the guitar. These mental experiences of a postural illusion generated by intraoperative stimulation could be related to neuroplasticity mechanisms induced by the slow growth of low-grade glioma within the knob of the hand. Such a functional reorganization may explain why this area was removed without permanent deficits. This perception of biomechanically impossible movements during surgery might be due to a transient disruption by stimulating the frontoparietal network involved in the coding of the body image.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000381987,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

During the subacute phase of the brain infarction, she became alert and insisted, ""My eldest daughter is at my feet and I can touch her body with my feet."" The patient's abnormal experience was accompanied by visual information, such as her daughter's physical characteristics and clothing, which could not be directly confirmed, and a false ideation that she had two eldest daughters. Although the patient was aware that her experience was abnormal, she was unable to deny her strong beliefs regarding the experience. We concluded that a series of the patient's abnormal experiences consisted of both tactile hallucinations and delusions. In this case, the subjects of the delusions associated with the patient's tactile hallucinations were limited to close relatives. Finally, it was clinically important that introspection by the patient revealed details of the nature of her hallucinations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001674,,brain infarction; delusion; right middle cerebral artery; tactile hallucination,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

As to our knowledge, there is no published paper relating delusional disorder, paranoid type (DD-PT) and UIA, which can have important clinical implication. We describe a case of a woman who had DD-PT and UIA. The patient in her fifties, a typist with elementary school education, presented to the psychiatrist with the symptoms of irritability, insomnia, suspiciousness and paranoid ideas lasting for about a year. She showed clear symptoms of a delusional disorder. The psychiatrist established the diagnosis of DD-PT according to ICD-10. Olanzapine therapy, 10 mg day, was introduced immediately, causing partial improvement. In further diagnostic procedure, psychological tests were performed. The finding confirmed the diagnosis and average intellectual efficacy. The additional findings of impaired verbal fluency (VF) and hand tremor signalized an organic origin. The patient was referred to a neurologist, who assessed hand tremor, but otherwise the finding was normal. Brain CT revealed the possible UIA. Neurological hospitalization was quickly organized, and the definitive diagnosis of basilar artery aneurysm of 22 mm in diameter was made by angiography. Several days later, osteoplastic supraorbital craniotomy was performed at the neurosurgical department, with right sided keyhole approach in microsurgical technique, and the aneurysmal neck was clipped. The postoperative course was accompanied by meningitis treated with antibiotics. In neurological status, cerebellar symptomatology, tremor of the left hand, mild hemiparesis on the left side and the right eyelid ptosis persisted. Paranoid delusions were absent, but depressive symptoms emerged. Eight months after the surgery (approx. 11 months after the first test), control psychological testing was performed. The finding showed depression with significant perceptive disorganization. The VF result was within the normal limits. The patient is still being continuously followed-up. During preliminary diagnostic work-up, the possible organic cause and/or relation was suspected, based only on the psychiatric assessment and psychological report, because neurological status was free from any abnormalities other than tremor of the hands. The reported case confirmed the importance of detailed psychiatric interview and psychological testing in persons with psychic disorders, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and therapy.

We report the unique case of a patient with somatoparaphrenia in whom dense tactile imperception in the left hand dramatically recovered when she was instructed to report touches delivered to her niece's hand, rather than to her own hand. We suggest that, through this verbal instruction, the mismatch between the patient's belief about the ownership of her left hand and her ability to perceive touch on it was transiently recomposed.

Despite this, PH performed almost perfectly on first-order false belief tasks and on a novel nonverbal second-order false belief task. PH was also successful on a novel test of ""ToM semantics"" that required evaluation of the certainty implied by different mental state terms.

One patient, with a self-perspective inhibition deficit, almost always used the reality-based response strategy; in contrast, the other patient, with a deficit in taking other perspectives, tended to use the simplified mentalising strategy without necessarily transposing her own perspective. We discuss the extent to which the pattern of performance of both patients could relate to their executive function deficit and how it can inform us on the cognitive and neural components involved in belief reasoning.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.03.013,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

It is thought to result from right hemispheric dysfunction or interhemispheric disequilibrium, which provides a neuroanatomical model for illness unawareness in schizophrenia. Lack of insight contributes to medication nonadherence and poor treatment outcomes and is often refractory to pharmacological and psychological interventions. We present the first report of transient illness awareness (<8 hours) after individual bilateral electroconvulsive therapy treatments in the case of a 39-year-old man with antipsychotic refractory schizophrenia. Electroencephalography demonstrated frontal slow wave activity with shifting frontotemporal predominance, which was concurrent with the patient's transient level of insight. A systematic review of the literature on electroconvulsive therapy-induced illness awareness in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders produced zero relevant results. Future research should focus on the prospective role of focal interventions, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, in the development of a neurophysiological model for anosognosia reversal in schizophrenia that may, in turn, contribute to novel therapeutic developments targeting lack of illness awareness.",{},,The journal of ECT,10.1097/YCT.0b013e3181f816f6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Fantastic utterances from brain-injured patients are difficult to interpret as confabulation or delusion. Starting from two clinical observations, we analyse the terms ""spontaneous confabulations"" and ""delusion"". Two brain-injured patients presented with fantastic utterances; the adhesion was complete for both patients. They also suffered from amnesic and executive disorders. Clinical interviews with neuropsychologist and psychopathologist could not distinct between spontaneaous confabulations and delusion. Neuropsychological interpretations of spontaneous confabulations are (1) the deficient strategic retrieval process arising from executive failures and (2) confusion of the temporal order of information within memory. These hypotheses cannot explain the fantastic utterances described. Are spontaneous fantastic confabulations a specific entity or did these patients present a morbid association of neurological and psychiatric disorders? Fantastic confabulations are very scarcely described and the association of neurological and psychiatric impairments enables us to better describe the clinical observations. Spontaneous confabulations reported after amnesic and executive disorders are indeed typically composed of the patient's past experiences and do not usually comprehend fantastic utterances. Neurological and psychological analyses of the fantastic utterances from two brain-injured patients do not respond to the definition of spontaneous confabulation. Fantastic confabulations are a rare entity and we propose another explanation consisting of the association of neurological and psychiatric disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Annales de readaptation et de medecine physique : revue scientifique de la Societe francaise de reeducation fonctionnelle de readaptation et de medecine physique,10.1016/j.annrmp.2008.05.005,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,fre

This condition is known as anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). Recent behavioural experiments suggest that some residual intentionality might be preserved in patients with anosognosia and that the false belief of having moved originates from a failure to notice discrepancies between movement expectancies and the actual state of the motor system. This failure may be caused by a lack of afferent sensory information concerning the movement or alternatively by a direct dysfunction of the brain regions involved in actions' motor monitoring (i.e., the comparator system). Here we examined the effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right premotor cortex in a patient with a bilateral lesion, involving predominantly the right hemisphere, and a dense unawareness for his left hemiplegia. During sham or anodal tDCS the patient was requested to judge his ability to perform simple motor actions (i) without actually executing the movement itself (""offline"" condition) and after having performed a series of verbally cued finger opposition movements (""online"" condition) with (i) eyes-closed or (ii) eyes-open. We found that anodal tDCS induces a significant remission of the false experience of movement only when the patient is requested to actually perform the movement with eyes open. Conversely, the patient's awareness does not improve in both the ""offline"" condition (in which the patient does not attempt to perform the movement) and in the ""online"" condition, when vision is precluded (""online"" condition, eyes-closed). We conclude that the stimulation of the premotor cortex by tDCS activates brain regions involved in motor monitoring, temporary restoring the ability of the motor comparator system to correctly appreciate afferent information and build up a veridical motor awareness.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.007,,Anosognosia for hemiplegia; Intention to move; Motor awareness; Neglect; Transcranial direct current stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Although both psychiatrists and neurologists attempted to link delusions with anatomical locations of the brain lesion, comorbid psychiatric and neurological disorders make the interpretation of delusions difficult. The purpose of the present paper is to report the clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in patients with delusional disorder due to diffuse cerebrovascular diseases, and to redefine the concept of 'vascular delusion'. The clinical features and MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively in a series of seven patients with 'delusional disorder due to cerebrovascular disease' as defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV). The average age of onset is 64. No patient had a prior personal or family history of major psychiatric illness. The illness is presented as acute, subacute or stepwise course. Hypertension was present in all patients. Two had diabetes mellitus, and one had atrial fibrillation. Three had clinical evidence of previous cerebrovascular attacks, only one showed minor neurological deficits. Three had diffuse cortical slow wave in electroencephalogram. No patient had significant cognitive impairment but had multiple cortical and subcortical cerebrovascular lesions in MRI, with white-matter lesions (WML) in bilateral frontal areas. Delusional disorder due to diffuse cerebrovascular change is characterized by late-onset, stepwise course, and comorbid medical and neurological diseases. The results of vascular changes in the present study did not establish a cause-effect relationship and should be considered as multifactorial in pathogenesis. The findings suggested the hypothesis of neural circuit theory. Further studies in larger numbers of patients and newer neuroimaging techniques are needed to expand the knowledge learned from these findings.",{},,Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1046/j.1440-1819.2001.00798.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

Based on a clinical case we discuss OCD from the point of view of will psychology. As our case concerns a schizophrenic psychosis, we focus here on OCD appearing in schizophrenia. For this approach we refer to classic neuropsychology which deals intensively with problems of the will. Accordingly, patients suffering from brain injuries are confined to habitual activities which follow unintentionally from the present situation. This sort of present-related spontaneousness is expressed in the concept ""becoming."" On the other hand, patients suffering from OCD are alienated from habitual activities.

Apropos of 3 cases].,"Delaunay, M; Erny, A; M√©raud, J P; Le Clech, C; Verret, J L; G√©niaux, M",Delaunay,"The meninges are frequently involved during the dissemination of malignant melanoma. This ""meningeal melanoma"" ranks fairly high on the list of metastatic meningites, side by side with meningeal carcinomatosis proper (i.e. related to a malignant epithelial tumour). Meningeal melanoma may be associated with a cerebral metastasis or isolated, as in the three cases reported here. Although its prognosis is sombre, its diagnosis is important since the possibilities of treatment are limited but exist. Case 1. This was a 68-year old woman who had initially presented with malignant melanoma in the maxillary region (SSM level IV, thickness 2.9 mm). Two years after the primary tumor was excised, secondary lesions developed in the lymph nodes and bones. A few weeks later, the patient fell into mental confusion progressing towards delusion of persecution. Neurological examination and CT scans were normal, but numerous melanoma cells were found in the CSF. This woman died one month after the first neurological signs had appeared. Case 2. This 63-year old man presented with bilateral axillary adenopathy and inflammatory thoracic plaques which at histology had proved to be metastases from a malignant melanoma of the shoulder surgically treated 10 years previously. After 14 months of almost complete remission under multiple chemotherapy (CPDD, ACTD, VDS), headaches and lumbosacral pain developed. Standard radiography and CT of the spine gave normal results, and it was only at the third lumbar puncture that the CSF was found to contain malignant cells. The patient died 2 months after the first neurological manifestations. Case 3. A 42-year old woman developed headaches and dysesthaesia in the arms and head. This was followed by oppositional semi-mutism. All exploratory examinations were normal, except for that of the CSF which showed 18 cells/mm3, 50 p. 100 of which were melanoma cells. The patient was transferred to the Dermatology department where he underwent excision of a left scapular melanoma difficult to classify (malignant blue naevus?). Combined treatment with Fotemustine* and DTIC produced an incomplete but relatively prolonged response. Death occurred after 8 months. A. Meningeal melanoma accounts for about 10 p. 100 of all metastatic meningites. The most frequent primary tumours in meningeal carcinomas are breast cancer and lung cancer. Malignant melanoma ranks third or fourth, but when the relative frequency of each of these three malignant diseases is taken into account, it appears that the risk of malignant melanoma is higher than that of any other solid tumour. B. In 410 cases extracted from the literature, the meninges were involved in 30 p. 100 of malignant metastatic melanomas found at autopsy. There is no publication that makes it possible to evaluate the relative frequency of melanomas affecting only the meninges or coexisting with cerebral metastases.

In the present paper we describe exceptionally long-lasting somatoparaphrenia in two focal brain-damaged patients: GA who had a right hemorrhagic fronto-parieto-temporal stroke and AC who developed a left ischemic parieto-occipital lesion. The presence and severity of somatoparaphrenia did not change in either patient during a 2-year follow-up, whereas the two patients showed different evolution of anosognosia for motor disorders, severity of extrapersonal neglect and cognitive impairments. Moreover, impairment of position sense was associated with somatoparaphrenia in one patient only; neither patient showed personal neglect.

15774506,Seeing it my way: a case of a selective deficit in inhibiting self-perspective.,"Samson, Dana; Apperly, Ian A; Kathirgamanathan, Umalini; Humphreys, Glyn W",Samson,"Little is known about the functional and neural architecture of social reasoning, one major obstacle being that we crucially lack the relevant tools to test potentially different social reasoning components. In the case of belief reasoning, previous studies have tried to separate the processes involved in belief reasoning per se from those involved in the processing of the high incidental demands such as the working memory demands of typical belief tasks. In this study, we developed new belief tasks in order to disentangle, for the first time, two perspective taking components involved in belief reasoning: (i) the ability to inhibit one's own perspective (self-perspective inhibition); and (ii) the ability to infer someone else's perspective as such (other-perspective taking). The two tasks had similar demands in other-perspective taking as they both required the participant to infer that a character has a false belief about an object's location. However, the tasks varied in the self-perspective inhibition demands. In the task with the lowest self-perspective inhibition demands, at the time the participant had to infer the character's false belief, he or she had no idea what the new object's location was. In contrast, in the task with the highest self-perspective inhibition demands, at the time the participant had to infer the character's false belief, he or she knew where the object was actually located (and this knowledge had thus to be inhibited). The two tasks were presented to a stroke patient, WBA, with right prefrontal and temporal damage. WBA performed well in the low-inhibition false-belief task but showed striking difficulty in the task placing high self-perspective inhibition demands, showing a selective deficit in inhibiting self-perspective. WBA also made egocentric errors in other social and visual perspective taking tasks, indicating a difficulty with belief attribution extending to the attribution of emotions, desires and visual experiences to other people. The case of WBA, together with the recent report of three patients impaired in belief reasoning even when self-perspective inhibition demands were reduced, provide the first neuropsychological evidence that the inhibition of one's own point of view and the ability to infer someone else's point of view rely on distinct neural and functional processes.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh464,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This paper reviews current theories of confabulation focusing on source monitoring, temporal-context, and retrieval theories. The attributes and criticisms of these three models are discussed. From this review, a three-factor cognitive-neuropsychological framework is proposed, which can be used to explain the variable symptoms of confabulation. The framework takes its basis from the Langdon and Coltheart (2000a, 2000b) cognitive model of delusional belief formation. The model suggests that two deficits are likely in most cases of confabulation - an executive control retrieval deficit and an evaluation deficit. It also takes into consideration how the general organization of the autobiographical memory store and a person's individual emotional/motivational biases can influence confabulatory symptoms and content. This is an overarching framework that can be used to model confabulations, and it builds upon links between delusions and confabulation.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290600694901,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A CT scan 2 weeks later showed a spontaneous hyperdense area corresponding to a left subcortical parietal hematoma. The patient used his spontaneous language to express body image disturbances: intense prolonged feeling of amputation related to the upper limb and foot on the right side, hemiasomatognosia without anosognosia, autotopagnosia. Also associated were a right-sided visual negligence and a more general inability to handle spatial data leading to a temporospatial disorientation. Mild language disorders were suggestive of subcortical aphasia: normal incitation and repetition; with semantic paraphasias, poor verbal fluency. Furthermore comprehension of orders or propositions concerning spatial data were poor. Finally, there were signs suggestive of callosal disconnection: paradoxical extinction of the left ear during dichotic listening, agraphia and anomia of the left hand, ideomotor apraxia of the left upper limb, difficulty in visual transfer. The lesion interrupted thalamic tracts to parietal regions and callosal fibers linking parieto-occipital association areas. This twofold lesion was analyzed for each of the neuropsychological disturbances observed. Certain aspect of cerebral function in this patient were reminiscent of ""split-brain"" disorders.

Associated findings were a misrepresentation of space in drawing in the first case, and a left hemiparesis, a left sensory extinction, a left hemianopsia, a left visual neglect, a constructional apraxia and a misrepresentation of space in the second case. Such a spatial delirium has been described after severe head injury but rarely after unilateral cerebral lesions. The latter involve constantly the right hemisphere, either in the frontal, temporo-parietal or thalamic region.

In Experiment 1 simple delayed pointing was compared with immediate pointing. In the immediate pointing task both variable and constant errors increased with target eccentricity. In contrast to the performance of control subjects and contrary to their own beliefs, the patients both showed improved accuracy in the delay condition. This improvement was manifest as a reduction in both pointing variability and in the constant angular error towards the point of fixation. Both angular errors and their improvement with the delay were proportional to target eccentricity. Experiment 2 used a task in which the target was pre-viewed 5s prior to its re-exposure for pointing ('delayed real pointing'). On some trials a conflict was introduced between the present and previous visual information by changing the target's location during the delay. In contrast to control subjects, who ignored the pre-viewed location and aimed directly at the current target, both patients with optic ataxia initiated their movements towards the previously viewed target location. Evidently they relied on off-line information in preference to on-line visual information. In addition, the patients often failed to detect the changes in target location. One of the patients sometimes even guessed incorrectly that the target had changed its location, and her movement trajectory was then more affected by her false belief than by the target's actual location. These findings confirm that posterior parietal lesions severely disrupt direct visuomotor transformations, and suggest that the residual performance is mediated indirectly by expectations or beliefs about target position.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.004,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

2412284,[Transformation to an animal. Metamorphosis or metaphor? A delusional episode following brain contusion].,"Assal, G",Assal,Three years after a serious cerebral contusion a patient became delirious for a period of several months. During that time he pretended to turn into a cock. This theme is interpreted as a metaphorical expression rather than as a firm belief in a real metamorphosis. The feelings of strangeness considered as a matricial condition of delirious phenomenons are debated. Of first importance are the lesions of the right hemisphere upon which are often added more diffuse impairments of the frontal lobes and of the brain stem. The rarity of this phenomenon is to be emphasized whereas the references to animals seem to haunt human soul.,{},,"Schweizer Archiv fur Neurologie und Psychiatrie (Zurich, Switzerland : 1985)",,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Switzerland,fre
10703014,[Somatoparaphrenia. A positive variant of anosognosia for hemiplegia].,"Paulig, M; Weber, M; Garbelotto, S",Paulig,"Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP), i.e., unawareness of motor deficits and associated disorders, has been frequently reported, pre-dominantly following right hemispheric lesions. To a smaller extent, there are case reports of patients who give accounts of a feeling of strangeness concerning the contralesional limbs and sometimes attribute them to other persons. This ""positive-variant"" of AHP has been labeled ""somatoparaphrenia"" (SP). We report a case of SP in a 85-year-old woman with infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior parts of the right thalamus. She showed AHP and described her left side alternatively as her handicapped nephew and a clumsy cat. Misidentification of her daughter also occurred. With respect to the literature the predominant neuroanatomical features involved are lesions including right parietal cortex and/or posterior parts of the thalamus. Theories concerning the pathogenesis of this phenomenon comprise a denial of the illness, a lack of awareness caused by reduced sensory feedback and neglect, a misidentification or disturbance of the active discovery process considered necessary for realizing one's disorder.",{},,Der Nervenarzt,10.1007/s001150050018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,ger

A misidentification delusion is a fixed, false beliefabout the identity ofa person, an object, a place, or the time. In the differential diagnosis, psychiatric diseases and neurological diseases are prominent. Patients with a psychiatric disease are usually younger than 40 years, often have a psychiatric history, and usually have other psychotic symptoms like paranoid delusions and hallucinations. Brain tumours and temporal lobectomy have previously been described as a neurological cause of a misidentification delusion; the surgical removal ofa meningioma as such has not been previously described. In patients with a misidentification delusion, the connection between the perception of an identity and its accompanying emotions and memories is disturbed.

She noted a difficulty in holding a glass and hand tremor in June of 1996 when she was 63 years old. In July of 1996, she tended to lean toward left when she walked. She also noted truncal titubation. In November of 1996, she started to have visual hallucination and delusion in which she said ""I see something is flying on the wall."", ""Somebody has come into my room"", and things like that. She was admitted to our service on November 22, 1996. On admission, she was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed disturbance in recent memory. Hasegawa's dementia rating scale was 22/30. She showed vivid visual hallucination with colors in which she saw faces of dwarfs and angels, a space ship, and others. Higher cerebral functions were normal. She showed left oculomotor palsy which was a sequel of an aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage nine years before. Otherwise cranial nerves were unremarkable. She showed ataxic gait, limb ataxia, truncal titubation, and postural hand tremor. She had no weakness and no muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits. Plantar response was flexor. Sensation was intact. Laboratory examination was also unremarkable. Complete survey for occult malignancy was negative. CSF was under a normal pressure and cell count was 1/microliter, total protein 27 mg/dl, and sugar 68 mg/dl. Cranial CT scan was unremarkable. MRI was not obtained because of the presence of an aneurysm clip in the left internal carotid-posterior communication artery junction. She showed progressive deterioration in her mental function. By January 1997, she became unable to stand or walk with marked dementia. Repeated CSF exams and cranial CT scans were unremarkable. She suffered from several episodes of aspiration pneumonia. A trial of three days methylprednisolone pulse therapy was given starting on March 7, 1997, which was of no effect on her neurologic status. On March 28, 1997, she was intubated because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In April 2, her body temperature rose to 38 degrees C. On April 9, 1997, her blood pressure dropped and resuscitation was unsuccessful. She was pronounced dead on the same day. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had primary leptomeningeal lymphoma. Other possibilities entertained among the audience included brain stem encephalitis of unknown type, carcinomatous cerebellar degeneration plus limbic encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, thalamic degeneration, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Post-mortem examination revealed thickening and clouding of the leptomeninges; Gram-positive diplococci were found in the leptomeninges. This meningitis appeared to have been an complication in the terminal stage of her illness. Microscopic examination revealed astrocytosis in the midbrain tegmentum. Cerebral cortices showed only mild astrtocytosis. No cerebellar atrophy was seen and Purkinje cells were retained which excluded paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Neuropathologic diagnosis was bacterial meningitis, however, the presence of brain stem encephalitis prior to the onset of bacterial meningitis could not be excluded. It is interesting to note that the diagnosis of the primary neurologic disease of this patient was not easy even after autopsy. As autopsy permission was obtained only for the brain, it was not clear whether or not this patient had an occult malignancy somewhere in her body, however, there was no evidence to indicate paraneoplastic degeneration of the central nervous system. As the patient did not have meningeal signs until one month before her death, it is difficult to ascribe her entire neurologic problems to her meningitis.

This 35-year-old male homosexual, who had no psychiatric history, suddenly developed in November 1988 the following psychiatric signs: he started to walk back and forth incessantly, he had the impression that he was the subject of the conversations of the passers-by, that all the posters and notices refer to him, and that he was God. He was admitted in a psychiatric department where the symptoms were progressively curbed by neuroleptics (cyamemazine 75 mg, and haloperidol 15 mg). The episode was not questioned by the patient, but attributed to bad eating habits. HIV-positivity had been discovered a year later (during systematic screening). A computerized tomographic (CT) scan performed subsequently to this delirium was interpreted as normal. Four weeks later the patient was referred to us. The psychiatric condition was stabilized in spite of a certain aggressiveness and the probable persistence of an underlying delirium state. Laboratory examinations showed the following: blood count revealed leukopenia (2.2 G/l) and thrombocytopenia (135 G/l; OKT4/OKT8 ratio was 0.08; CSF: normal; sputum culture evidenced the presence of pneumocystis carinii; EEG were normal.
