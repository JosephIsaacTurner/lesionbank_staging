17786780,Alexithymia-like disorder in right anterior cingulate infarction.,"Schäfer, Ralf; Popp, Kerstin; Jörgens, Silke; Lindenberg, Robert; Franz, Matthias; Seitz, Rüdiger J",Schäfer,"The frontal midline structures have been demonstrated by functional neuroimaging to be involved in the affective control of human behavior. However, due to the rareness of diseases affecting this part of the brain little is known about behavioral abnormalities following damage to these brain areas. We present a patient with a right anterior cingulate infarct who presented with an alexithymia-like disorder. Event-related potentials revealed an abnormality of emotional face perception in the right cerebral hemisphere. We suggest that the anterior cingulate lesion induced a deficit of emotion processing including emotional face perception probably due to an interference in a critical node of a large-scale network subserving affective control of behavior.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790701494964,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
23895444,Alexithymia: the story of a survivor of childhood traumatic brain injury.,"Ho, Nerissa S P; Lee, Tatia M C",Ho,"Affective abnormalities resulting from traumatic brain injuries can pose major threats to the long-term outcomes of neurorehabilitation, especially when they have gone unattended in the process of rehabilitation. This study reports a case of a 46-year-old woman who survived a severe traumatic brain injury to the right occipital cortex (BA18/19) at the age of 10. While her cognitive recovery was remarkable, she has been living with a significant affective disturbance: difficulty with feeling others' feelings. Neuropsychological tests and self-reported questionnaires capturing the patient's neuropsychological profile, social cognitive abilities, emotional responses, affective awareness and visual imager were administered to the patient. While cognitive functioning beside attention has recovered well, findings clearly indicate that she is indeed suffering from a high level of alexithymia. It is speculated that the alexithymia observed may relate to the damage to the visual cortex, which is an important neural substrate for visual imagery and/or damage to the bottom-up stimulus-driven attention system in the right hemisphere. This case exemplified a possible organic basis of social affective disturbance, which may be overlooked in the process of neurorehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.804198,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
30838889,Cognitive rehabilitation using immersive virtual reality at young age: A case report on traumatic brain injury.,"De Luca, Rosaria; Portaro, Simona; Le Cause, Maria; De Domenico, Carmen; Maggio, Maria Grazia; Cristina Ferrera, Maria; Giuffrè, Grazia; Bramanti, Alessia; Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore",De Luca,"Adolescents having moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience long-lasting cognitive, emotional, and behavioral problems. In current clinical practice, rehabilitation techniques to treat cognitive abnormalities may be classified in two main categories, i.e. conventional or advanced. Aim of this case study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an immersive virtual environment (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment [CAREN]), in a young boy affected by severe TBI. A 15-year-old boy with TBI involving the right parietal-temporal region underwent two different rehabilitation trainings, including standard cognitive rehabilitation alone in a usual clinical setting (face-to-face intervention with a paper and pencil approach) or the same cognitive program using virtual scenarios by means of CAREN. We evaluated the patient's cognitive status, before and after the two different trainings, by using a specific psychometric battery to evaluate the cognitive and behavioral functioning, such as attention abilities, visuo-spatial and executive functions. Only at the end of the CAREN training, we observed a significant improvement in specific cognitive and motor domains, such as attention abilities, visuo-executive processes, emotional awareness, and balance. Cognitive training, using immersive Virtual Reality, may be a useful tool to facilitate cognitive recovery in TBI patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Applied neuropsychology.

27987387,Possible common neurological breakdowns for alexithymia and humour appreciation deficit: A case study.,"Patrikelis, Panayiotis; Konstantakopoulos, George; Lucci, Giuliana; Katsaros, Vasileios K; Sakas, Damianos E; Gatzonis, Stylianos; Stranjalis, Giorgos",Patrikelis,"This brief work is an attempt to point to the possible common neurological breakdowns in giving rise to alexithymia, and impaired appreciation of humour. In particular, we present the case of a patient who lost the ability to enjoy humour after the surgical removal of a frontal groove meningioma, although he was still able to detect it, while at the same time was diagnosed with organic alexithymia. Our results indicate that problems in the affective appreciation of humour and in emotionalizing (alexithymic symptoms) may be the result of damage to the ventral-rostral portions of the ACG/mPFC, which prevent the patient from assessing the salience of emotion and motivational information, and generating emotional reactions; as a result he has trouble experiencing emotions, knowing how he and others feel, and enjoy humour.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2016.12.005,,Alexithymia; Cognition; Humour appreciation; Neuropathology; Olfactory meningioma,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
4001301,Aprosodia and alexithymia--a case report.,"Fricchione, G; Howanitz, E",Fricchione,"Aprosodias are disorders of affective language and behavior resulting from focal lesions of the right hemisphere. Patients devoid of prosody are unable to endow their language with emotion and feeling. They may show a lack of spontaneous prosody or gesturing. Alexithymia is a cognitive-affective disturbance which includes difficulty in recognizing and describing feelings and emotional states. Alexithymic patients have a diminished inner fantasy life and constricted emotional activity sometimes exhibited in a rigid posture and lack of expressive facial movements. Thus, both aprosodia and alexithymia to some extent are disorders of affective language and behavior. The patient discussed below had a motor aprosodia and can be described as having alexithymic features. The relationship between aprosodia and alexithymia and possible neurophysiological implications for the latter condition are examined.",{},,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,10.1159/000287873,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
12119081,Organic alexithymia: a study of acquired emotional blindness.,"Becerra, Rodrigo; Amos, Andrew; Jongenelis, Steven",Becerra,"The phrase 'organic alexithymia' is introduced as a clinically and theoretically useful construct for furthering understanding of alexithymia and the occurrence of alexithymic symptoms in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). The construct is illustrated by the case study of HR, a 21-year-old man seen at the State Head Injury Unit, Perth, for neuropsychological and clinical assessment 2 years following a motor vehicle accident. HR's case supports the hypotheses that a syndrome substantially similar to alexithymia can occur in patients with acquired brain injury, and that the acquired nature of the organic disorder may cause it to be systematically different from the established syndrome. The case demonstrates the clinical relevance of a construct like organic alexithymia when treating patients with ABI. It also highlights the need to develop instruments capable of identifying the condition and differentiating it from symptoms of depression.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050110119817,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Alexithymia is defined as ""a difficulty in identifying and describing feelings"", although there is no consensus on the exact diagnosis and treatment. A 36-year-old right-handed man, affected by ischemic stroke (which occurred about 3 months before admission) involving the right hemisphere (ie, the fronto-parieto-temporal region) with left hemiparesis and behavioral abnormalities, came to our observation for intensive rehabilitation. He was treated unsuccessfully with a traditional and behavioral training. Alexithymia due to ischemic stroke. Then, a specific combined protocol using computerized emotional and virtual emotional training was applied in a semi-immersive virtual reality environment using the BTS-Nirvana device. At the end of this novel rehabilitation approach, the patient showed a significant improvement in emotional skills, cognitive performances, and coping strategies. Virtual reality, in addition to standard therapy, may be a valuable tool in improving emotional abnormalities due to brain lesions, such as alexithymia.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000022313,PMC7505357,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
26735867,Rehabilitation following cerebral anoxia: An assessment of 27 patients.,"Tazopoulou, Eva; Miljkovitch, Raphaële; Truelle, Jean-Luc; Schnitzler, Alexis; Onillon, Michel; Zucco, Thierry; Hawthorne, Graeme; Montreuil, Michèle",Tazopoulou,"(1) To evaluate cognitive and emotional impairments, disability and quality-of-life for adults with cerebral anoxia institutionalized in residential care facilities. (2) To evaluate the efficacy of medication, psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities. Twenty-seven persons with cerebral anoxia were recruited, on average 8 years post-injury. Only 20 went through the whole study. Over three consecutive 2-month periods, they were assessed four times to evaluate: baseline observations (T1-T2), adjustment of their medication (T2-T3); and the effect of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities such as physical and artistic or cultural activities usually proposed in the facilities involved (T3-T4). Examined variables at all time points were cognitive status, anxiety and depression, anosognosia, alexithymia, disability and quality-of-life. All participants exhibited cognitive and emotional impairments comparable to those reported in the literature. Statistical analyses revealed good baseline stability of their condition and no significant effects of changes in medication (between T2 and T3). Conversely, following implementation of psychotherapy, support group and therapeutic activities (between T3 and T4), quality-of-life and social participation were significantly improved. Social participation and quality-of-life for persons instutionalized several years after cerebral anoxia were improved by psychotherapeutic and therapeutic activities.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1113563,,Anoxia; disability; psychotherapy; quality-of-life; rehabilitation; social re-integration,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
25577137,"Preserved emotional awareness of pain in a patient with extensive bilateral damage to the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala.","Feinstein, Justin S; Khalsa, Sahib S; Salomons, Tim V; Prkachin, Kenneth M; Frey-Law, Laura A; Lee, Jennifer E; Tranel, Daniel; Rudrauf, David",Feinstein,"Functional neuroimaging investigations of pain have discovered a reliable pattern of activation within limbic regions of a putative ""pain matrix"" that has been theorized to reflect the affective dimension of pain. To test this theory, we evaluated the experience of pain in a rare neurological patient with extensive bilateral lesions encompassing core limbic structures of the pain matrix, including the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala. Despite widespread damage to these regions, the patient's expression and experience of pain was intact, and at times excessive in nature. This finding was consistent across multiple pain measures including self-report, facial expression, vocalization, withdrawal reaction, and autonomic response. These results challenge the notion of a ""pain matrix"" and provide direct evidence that the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala are not necessary for feeling the suffering inherent to pain. The patient's heightened degree of pain affect further suggests that these regions may be more important for the regulation of pain rather than providing the decisive substrate for pain's conscious experience.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-014-0986-3,PMC4734900,Brain lesion; Consciousness; Emotion; Feeling; Limbic system,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Germany,eng
