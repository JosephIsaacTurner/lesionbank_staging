We diagnosed our patient with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) using computed tomography venogram, then detailed history and examination were obtained, and thorough blood tests and imaging were done to exclude other causes of CVT like thrombophilias, infections, and malignancies. Our patient is a 37-year-old heterosexual male, presented with headache only. The computed tomography venogram showed extensive CVT in the right internal jugular vein, sigmoid, transverse, and straight cerebral venous; detailed history and investigations suggest that his use of crushed oral contraceptive pills mixed with water topically on the scalp is the most important predisposing factor. This patient was managed with anticoagulants and is being followed in the clinic. Oral hormonal use in contraceptives is a known risk factor for CVT. This case sheds light on the importance of topical hormonal use concerning CVT in females and males; it stresses the need for more studies in that area, as it is poorly studied.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000455,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

32525581,Sexual Behavioral Disinhibition Associated with Nucleus Lentiformis Lesion: A Forensic Neuroscience Perspective Through a Case.,"Balcioglu, Yasin Hasan; Dogan, Mehmet; Incı, Ipek; Solmaz, Mustafa",Balcioglu,"Organic brain disturbances particularly related to frontal cortex structures and subcortical areas including the basal ganglia may play a role in behavioral disinhibition disorders. Kluver-Bucy syndrome (KBS), which is one of the better knowns of these syndromes, includes hyperorality, visual agnosia, and hypersexuality, has been reported to occur after temporal lobe and amygdala lesions; however, several patients who had focal lesions in areas other than the temporal cortex and amygdala have been reported to present partial KBS symptoms. Nucleus lentiformis refers to a large portion of the basal ganglia including the putamen and globus pallidus, and specific structures within this broad area are known to be important for reward and value-based decision making. To date, KBS symptoms including hypersexual behavior associated with nucleus lentiformis lesions have never been reported. Here, we present a 38-year-old male patient who developed increased sexual interest and hyperorality after infarctions in the right lenticular nucleus and right occipitotemporal region and committed a first-degree sexual assault. He was sent to our institution for the assessment of criminal responsibility to the index sexual crime. According to a comprehensive and thorough forensic psychiatric evaluation, he was diagnosed as having an organic personality disorder with partial KBS symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of deviant sexual behavior and hyperorality developing after nucleus lentiformis infarction.

Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are frequently responsible of such infections. However, concurrent infection with these two pathogens is uncommon and underreported in the literature. We describe the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian Belgian patient with no travel history, who presented with low-grade fever, headache and wasting syndrome. He was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at AIDS stage, with a HIV viral load of 506,000 viral copies/mL and a CD4 + T-cells count of 10 cells/µL. Diagnosis of disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans infection was made by positive serum cryptococcal antigen and positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans in blood and in cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection was made by positive culture on a biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node. With adequate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and treatment of these OIs, the patient recovered well and had a good clinical evolution. To our knowledge, this is the second case of coexistence of these two dangerous OIs reported in the post ART era. Clinicians should be aware that such co-infections still happen in high-income countries, in patients with severe immunodeficiency.

Approximately 2% to 5% of the people worldwide, even of younger age, are said to have aneurysms at cerebral arteries. In many cases, they remain clinically unapparent for decades. However, there are numerous risk factors for the rupture of an aneurysm, including temporary raises of the blood pressure. Such changes of the blood pressure can be induced even by several everyday behaviors. For example, any sort of sexual activities may cause extensive raises of the blood pressure because of several physical and psychological factors. The term ""sexual activity"" covers sexual intercourse as well as masturbation.

A growing number of published cases has recently indicated that hypersexual behavior may also arise in conjunction with treatment with second-generation antipsychotics. Although hypersexuality has been acknowledged as a possible side effect of antipsychotic treatment with partial dopamine agonists, including aripiprazole, only very few cases of olanzapine-associated hypersexuality have been reported in the literature. A 29-year-old man presented with delusions of persecution and reference, auditory hallucinations, and negative symptoms, and was diagnosed with paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenia. One and a half months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine, he developed compulsive sexual behavior and paraphilia, without signs of akathisia. After olanzapine discontinuation, a full remission of the hypersexual behavior was noted within one week, and treatment was switched to risperidone. Due to hyperprolactinemia, adjunct treatment with low-dose aripiprazole was initiated and a severe recurrence of identical hypersexual behavior occurred. The hypersexual behavior resolved completely within a week after aripiprazole discontinuation. This case illustrates that hypersexuality may be a rare adverse effect of treatment with second-generation antipsychotics. Although aripiprazole is a drug with a well-established risk for hypersexuality, the question of whether a causal association between hypersexuality and olanzapine exists remains currently unresolved. As the currently limited amount of available evidence precludes any definitive conclusions, additional research is warranted to delineate the possible neurobiological substrates of hypersexual and paraphilic disorders in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotics.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00318,PMC7212450,antipsychotic; aripiprazole; olanzapine; paraphilia; schizophrenia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS. There are currently limited data on the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in people living with HIV/AIDS with its associated opportunistic CNS infections as well as those without antiretroviral treatment. CASE REPORT Two young men with previously unknown HIV status and its related opportunistic infections received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell), inactivated. Both patients had the risk factor of having sex with men (men who have sex with men). Fever and first neurological symptoms occurred within the first few days after vaccination. Both patients were hospitalized and were tested positive for HIV for the first time. Both were further diagnosed from brain imaging as having CNS opportunistic infections. A presumptive diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was established as the working diagnosis according to the laboratory and epidemiological factors. Despite the treatment, neurological and clinical deficits worsened and eventually led to death in both patients. CONCLUSIONS The causality analyses showed that both adverse events had a possible inconsistent causal relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. Our cases may reflect the need for further studies on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people with HIV/AIDS-associated CNS opportunistic infection as well as people with HIV/AIDS who never receive antiretroviral treatment (ART).","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936257,PMC9150601,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Much remains unclear about its clinical onset and subsequent course. Although successful treatment depends on diagnosing the disorder early and therefore minimizing long-term complications, this is a difficult task owing to the atypical onset of this condition and the prolonged clinical course that has been observed in some patients. This report, illustrating a patient with slowly progressing psychiatric manifestations, unusual imaging and electrophysiological features, extends the information on varied clinical phenotypes. A 32-year-old woman suffered from an isolated depressive disorder for 4 months before undergoing psychiatric evaluation. During the following 5 months, she manifested hypersexuality, dysarthria, imbalance, dyskinesias and decreased word output. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions, a few contrast-enhanced, involving the corona radiata, the periventricular white matter, the deep gray nuclei, the optic nerves and the brainstem. MRI spectroscopy disclosed confluent bilateral demyelination and focal optic nerve involvement suggesting widespread encephalitis. Visual evoked potential studies indicated a demyelinating disorder. Serological screening and total body positron-emission tomography yielded negative findings for malignancies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed IgG oligoclonal bands and anti-NMDAR antibodies. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin provided only slight improvement, whereas switching to cyclophosphamide markedly improved her neurological status. In patients with a prolonged clinical course, including psychiatric and neurological symptoms, the differential diagnosis should be anti-NMDAR encephalitis. This report expands the known disease phenotypes in this emerging condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000358820,PMC3975751,Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis; Depressive disorder; Optic neuritis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

ALPD is so rare that its prevalence has not been established. Typically affecting middle-aged adults, this condition is often found in the context of Epstein Bar Virus infection and consists of angiocentric and angioinvasive pulmonary infiltrates. Herein, we present a biopsy-proven case of a patient manifesting with a viral meningoencephalomyelitis-like picture with brain, spinal cord, renal and splenic lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed to be ALPD in the context of newly diagnosed HIV infection. A 35 year-old homosexual man presented with a 5-week history of headaches followed by a 3-week history of horizontal diplopia, limb weakness and right 6th cranial nerve palsy. Lumbar puncture revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein and low glucose. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed scattered lesions throughout the brain and spinal cord and Computed Tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed hypodensities involving the kidneys and spleen. HIV testing was positive, with a viral load of 11,096 copies/mL and CD4 count of 324 cells/μL. Serum Epstein Bar virus PCR was positive with 12,434 copies/ml. Right frontal brain biopsy revealed gray matter containing angiogentric cerebritis with organizing infarction but Epstein Bar Virus-in situ preparations were negative and no viral inclusions were identified. A diagnosis of ALPD (also known as lymphomatoid granulomatosis) was made. The patient was initiated on antiretroviral therapy and treated with intravenous rituximab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles and made progressive improvements. By the time of discharge his strength had improved and he was ambulating again although with a walker. Within 2 months, his HIV viral load was suppressed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain 6 months later revealed interval improvement. At his most recent follow-up, 34 months later, his neurological symptoms had almost completed resolved. Albeit rare, ALPD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system lesions in persons with HIV once common etiologies have been eliminated. Furthermore, ALPD involving the central nervous system may occur in in the absence of documented EBV infection in the central nervous system.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,BMC infectious diseases,10.1186/s12879-018-3128-3,PMC5941628,Angiocentric lymph proliferative disorder; HIV; Lymphomatoid granulomatosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

2043912,The treatment of avoidance behaviour following severe brain injury by satiation through negative practice.,"Alderman, N",Alderman,"Brain-injured patients may frequently develop behaviour disorders in order to avoid participating in rehabilitation activities. In recent years, the use of behaviour modification techniques, particularly the use of positive reinforcement and time-out, has been increasingly reported in the literature as a means of remediating behaviour disturbance in this population. However, reward- or extinction-based programmes are generally not effective in the treatment of avoidance behaviours as they may be ineffective or, at worst, encourage further avoidance of rehabilitation activities. This paper, describes the use of satiation through negative practice in the successful treatment of a severely brain-injured patient whose behaviour, in the form of prolonged shouting, had previously not responded to the range of behavioural techniques used previously with this population. Two successive treatment programmes that were used in an attempt to satiate shouting are presented. Significant reductions in both the frequency and duration of shouting were found, enabling physical and functional gains to be made through successful participation in previously avoided rehabilitation activities. The validity of the use of this technique in the treatment of avoidance behaviour in brain-injured patients is discussed.",{},,Brain injury,10.3109/02699059108998516,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

These episodes included hypersexuality with qualitative changes of sex drive, obscene behavior, exhibitionism, masturbation and modified sexual orientation. Blunted affect, inability to recognize significant persons (visual agnosia) were also detected. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal and interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed decreased cerebral perfusion in both temporal lobes. The principal hypothesis is a Klüver-Bucy syndrome (KBS). In animals and human beings, this syndrome can be produced by bilateral temporal lobectomy. It is characterised by hypersexuality, visual agnosia, strong oral tendency, dietary changes, hypermetamorphosis and blunted affect. A minimum of three KBS elements suggests bilateral temporal dysfunction and supports the diagnosis. The syndrome may occur in herpes encephalitis, head trauma, Pick disease and temporal epilepsy. A single case of a patient, without any evidence for structural lesion in temporal lobes, is presented with many KBS symptoms, behavioral changes being due to complex partial seizure. Bitemporal dysfunction for this patient was confirmed by SPECT scan. On the other hand, the detected behavioral changes cannot be explained by temporal epilepsy alone. Postictal hypersexuality in temporal epilepsy consists in sexual arousal but not sexual aberrations as found in KBS. KBS following complex partial status epilepticus is a rare phenomenum.

Other symptoms were sexual disinhibition, tactlessness, abnormal discourse, and reduced need for food and sleep. His neuropsychological assessment revealed an anterograde amnesia, and an impairment of frontal-executive functions.

Ten subjects were admitted in the period 1997-99 to our emergency department for acute global amnesia related to sexual activity. They represented 18% of total acute global amnesias observed in the same period. All patients were males, aged between 41 and 64 years. TGA was found in nine cases, while one patient had subarachnoid haemorrhage, due to rupture of an aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery. The patient with subarachnoid haemorrhage showed neurologic defects (second-degree nystagmus and retropulsion), while no major neurologic abnormalities were found in TGA. Likewise computerized tomography (CT) scan was positive only in the case of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Patients and relatives in most cases left out sexual activity as a trigger factor.

LTG has no effect on serum levels of most female reproductive hormones, but its effect on male reproductive hormones still remains unclear. Improvement in sexual function after LTG treatment has been reported, and could have been caused by reduction of seizures, inhibition of focal discharges, or an unknown effect of LTG on reproductive hormones and protein levels. Two male patients exhibited acute hypersexuality while taking lamotrigine as add-on therapy: one patient on carbamazepine and one on oxcarbazepine. Neither prior history of psychiatric illness nor brain damage predisposed them to such a response to treatment, and in both patients, the hypersexuality was not a part of hypomania or a more diffuse psychiatric disturbance. In the first case, sexual hyperactivity resolved after discontinuation of LTG therapy without any concomitant treatment. In the second case, a reduction in the dose of LTG decreased the intensity of the hypersexuality and contributed to the patient's increased satisfaction with his sex life. Lamotrigine may cause drug-related hypersexuality by an unclear underlying mechanism.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,10.1016/j.yebeh.2006.01.005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It is a clinical presentation of bitemporal disorders with limbic system abnormalities. The most common cause of KBS is herpes encephalitis. An otherwise healthy 61-year-old woman presented with mental status changes (MMSE-0) after 6 days of severe vomiting. Extracellular dehydration, hyponatremia (107 mmol/L), low levels of natriuresis, and mild hypokalemia were noted. The initial computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal. Over 36 hours of hospitalization in a district hospital she developed unusual neuropsychiatric disorders: hypersexuality, hyperorality, absence, visual agnosia, sensory aphasia, amnesia, and depression typical of KBS. She was then transferred to a neurology department. Clear improvement was visible 3 months later: MMSE-22, moderation of hypersexuality and hyperorality, partial correction of amnesia and aphasia, regression of visual agnosia. But the prosopagnosia (face blindness) persisted, and the patient remained unable to differentiate positive and negative facial expressions. Intracranial mass, epilepsy, neuromeningeal infection and head trauma were all ruled out. Antiepileptic and antiherpetic agents were tested without success. There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or inappropriate vasopressin secretion. Only severe vomiting, corrected by water intake, could explain the hyponatremia. The first MRI showed bitemporal edema; 3 months later it showed large bitemporal lesions, both internal and external, with atrophy of the hippocampus and limbic system. These MRI findings are characteristic of KBS. To our knowledge, this is the only the second case of KBS with bitemporal myelinolysis reported related to excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (increase of 30 mmol/L over 36 h), which leads more usually to central pontine myelinolysis.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",10.1016/j.lpm.2007.08.021,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,eng

He ultimately died after a series of neurological complications developed. These complications, which are common in patients with AIDS, include progressive dementia, obtundation, and coma. As the number of patients with AIDS in our society increases over the next 5 years, it will become more important for the otolaryngologist to recognize the complications of this disease that involve the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is one of these complications. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, at this point, might best be treated by an approach of preventive medicine. However, such an approach would have far-reaching social and political implications--perhaps more so than in other venereally spread diseases.

A 38-year-old homosexual man presented with a recent history of headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an enhancing dural based right lateral wing mass that was thought to be a meningioma. The tumor had a signal intensity similar to the adjacent gray matter on T1-, T2-, and proton-weighted images. Angiography revealed that the tumor was vascular, supplied by the middle meningeal artery, but with contrast puddling as if there were small vascular lakes within the tumor. This evoked the possibility of a cavernous hemangioma. A craniotomy was performed, and the mass was resected. The pathological finding was consistent with a leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor was positive for alpha smooth muscle actin. Repeat testing for human immunodeficiency virus 2 months postoperatively was positive. Dural leiomyosarcomas are thought to take origin from the smooth muscles of the blood vessel walls. Another possible source is pluripotential mesenchymal cells.

Risk factors include homosexuality, intravenous drug abuse, Haitian descent, and multiple transfusion in the presence of hemophilia A. The etiology of AIDS remains unknown, but there is increasing evidence implicating a transmissible infectious agent and/or multiple antigenic exposures inducing a loss of immunoregulation. In a high-risk patient, the features of weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, and fever should arouse suspicion of AIDS. Diagnostic confirmation includes demonstration of reduced numbers of T lymphocytes with reversal of helper-suppressor T-lymphocyte ratio, presence of unusual opportunistic infections, and a progressive downhill course. The most common infection in AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Treatment failures with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) are common; pentamidine isethionate (Lomidine) may be more effective in eradicating the infection. In spite of initial improvement, recurrences of P carinii pneumonia and other opportunistic infections are common. In addition, other protozoan, viral, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial infections are frequent in patients with AIDS. Finally, rare neoplasms such as Kaposi's sarcoma and B-cell lymphoma, including primary lymphoma of the brain, are also being recognized as complications.

Sexual disinhibition was eliminated in supervised settings, but continued to occur if left unsupervised and this improvement resulted from behaviour management. Poor personal hygiene also improved markedly over the 6-month period. The goal of returning the patient home to live with her family was achieved and she remained there at follow-up.

The cause of Klüver-Bucy syndrome may be an injury, central nervous system infection, especially herpetic, Pick disease, temporal epilepsy and paraneoplastic encephalopathy. The condition is very rare in children; its occurrence in childhood was described in a few cases only. Symptom intensity and their manifestation depend on numerous diversified factors. A comparative presentation of two clinical cases of Klüver-Bucy syndrome following severe head injuries accompanied by description of computed tomography scans. The diagnosis of the syndrome does not require the presence of all the axial symptoms. Both patients were treated with carbamazepine. Regression of neuropsychological symptoms took a different course in each child, despite their similar brain damage. Fully symptomatic Klüver-Bucy syndrome is very rare.

We report the case of a patient who suffered a sudden delirium, expression of a probable right lenticular cerebral toxoplasmosis. This 35-year-old male homosexual, who had no psychiatric history, suddenly developed in November 1988 the following psychiatric signs: he started to walk back and forth incessantly, he had the impression that he was the subject of the conversations of the passers-by, that all the posters and notices refer to him, and that he was God. He was admitted in a psychiatric department where the symptoms were progressively curbed by neuroleptics (cyamemazine 75 mg, and haloperidol 15 mg). The episode was not questioned by the patient, but attributed to bad eating habits. HIV-positivity had been discovered a year later (during systematic screening). A computerized tomographic (CT) scan performed subsequently to this delirium was interpreted as normal. Four weeks later the patient was referred to us. The psychiatric condition was stabilized in spite of a certain aggressiveness and the probable persistence of an underlying delirium state. Laboratory examinations showed the following: blood count revealed leukopenia (2.2 G/l) and thrombocytopenia (135 G/l; OKT4/OKT8 ratio was 0.08; CSF: normal; sputum culture evidenced the presence of pneumocystis carinii; EEG were normal.
