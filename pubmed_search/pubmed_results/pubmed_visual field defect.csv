29110092,Tracking posttraumatic hemianopia.,"Decramer, Thomas; Van Keer, Karel; Stalmans, Peter; Dupont, Patrick; Sunaert, Stefan; Theys, Tom",Decramer,"Hemianopia after traumatic brain injury is not infrequent and results from retro-chiasmatic lesions. Differentiating optic pathway lesions can be challenging with classic imaging. Advanced imaging techniques as an investigational tool for posttraumatic hemianopia are discussed and their pitfalls highlighted through an illustrative case study. In a patient with posttraumatic hemianopia, MRI at 8 weeks and 2 years after trauma were analyzed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and morphometric analysis of the primary visual cortex (V1) were performed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed 2 years after trauma. DTI at 8 weeks showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the left optic tract together with a decrease in FA in the right optic tract and optic radiation. At 2 years, an isolated decrease of the left optic tract FA values was noticed together with signs of Wallerian degeneration on classic MR imaging. OCT showed thinning of the retina congruent with the visual field deficit. While DTI abnormalities were also present in the early scan, they were more diffuse and also encompassed functionally intact structures. Results of advanced imaging techniques need to be interpreted with caution and can vary according to the timing of imaging due to Wallerian degeneration.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-017-8661-2,,Diffusion tensor imaging; Hemianopia; Traumatic brain injury; Wallerian degeneration,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

This article offers an update of the intraoperative workflow and the general principles behind the 3D US acquisition of high-quality images.The authors also provide case examples illustrating the technique in two small mesial temporal lobe lesions and in one insular glioma. Due to the ease of acquiring new images for navigation, the operations can be guided by updated image volumes throughout the entire course of surgery. The high accuracy offered by 3D US systems, based on nearly real-time images, allows for precise and safe resections.

38206682,Homonymous hemianopia due to cerebral venous thrombosis: A case report.,"Choi, Woo Seok; Yoon, Sook Hyun; Lee, Donghun",Choi,"Diagnosing cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can be difficult because of nonspecific symptoms, such as headache and homonymous hemianopia (HH). Herein, we present a case of delayed CVT diagnosis due to nonspecific neurological symptoms and nonprominent lesions in a patient with HH. A 65-year-old woman presented with a sudden onset headache accompanied by right HH that lasted for 1 day. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were initially performed due to suspicion of ischemic lesions or hemorrhage in the left postchiasmal visual pathway; however, no remarkable acute brain lesions were detected. Ophthalmological examinations revealed no notable findings, except for a definite field defect in the Humphrey visual field test. The headaches then waxed and waned but recurred 3 days after the initial symptom.A repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which revealed left sectoral gyral swelling and vascular enhancement in the occipital lobe. To further evaluate venous drainage, additional 3-dimensional cerebral computed tomography angiography and 4-vessel angiography were conducted, revealing a partial filling defect in the left transverse sinus and superior venous drainage impairment. These findings suggested the presence of venous thrombosis in the left transverse sinus. The patient was diagnosed with thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, which subsequently caused the right HH. Anticoagulation therapy with parenteral heparin was started as soon as the diagnosis of CVT was confirmed. Eventually, the patient was solely managed with oral warfarin administration. Following 3 days of treatment, her headache resolved, and a subsequent visual field testing conducted 2 weeks later revealed a definite improvement in the field defect. Despite its favorable prognosis, CVT can be challenging to diagnose. CVT should be considered as a differential diagnosis when diagnosing patients who present with headaches accompanied by HH without prominent brain lesions.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000036204,PMC10754574,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

34587558,Dichoptic visual field mapping of suppression in exotropia with homonymous hemianopia.,"Economides, John R; Horton, Jonathan C",Economides,"The purpose of this study was to investigate which portions of the visual scene are perceived by each eye in an exotropic subject with acquired hemianopia. The pattern of suppression is predictable from knowledge of how suppression scotomas are organized in exotropic subjects with intact visual fields. Dichoptic perimetry was performed by having a subject wear red/blue goggles while fixating a cross that was either red or blue. Red, blue, or purple spots were presented briefly at peripheral locations. The subject's identification of the spot color revealed which eye was perceptually engaged at any given location in the visual fields. A 17-year-old female with a history of exotropia was evaluated after rupture of a right parietal arteriovenous malformation. Dichoptic perimetry showed a left homonymous hemianopia. All stimuli to the right of the right fovea's projection point were perceived via the right eye. Stimuli between the foveal projection points, which were separated horizontally by the 20° exotropia, were perceived by the left eye. Perception of the visual scene is shared by the eyes in hemianopia and exotropia. Suppression occurs only in the peripheral temporal retina of the eye contralateral to the brain lesion, regardless of which eye is engaged in fixation. Although exotropia expands the binocular field of vision in hemianopia, it is probably not an adaptive response, even when it develops after hemianopia.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of AAPOS : the official publication of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,10.1016/j.jaapos.2021.05.017,PMC8665098,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Only 10 cases have been reported, and they are often misdiagnosed as pituitary macroadenoma. We report the case of a 54-year-old Chinese man who developed progressive bitemporal hemianopsia and visual loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intrasellar and suprasellar clouded lesion adhering to the optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and hypophyseal stalk that was suspected of being a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma. Because of the atypically giant, hemorrhagic, and upward-growing lesion, an initial trans-sphenoidal approach failed, and subsequent transfrontal craniotomy was adopted to achieve macroscopically complete resection. Histopathologic findings revealed a benign melanocytic tumor. Despite an extensive search, no other primary or secondary site was found. Considering the relatively benign lesion, effective surgery, and potential significant consequences of radiotherapy, the patient received no further treatment and is still alive at the 7-year follow-up. Primary sellar melanocytic tumors are exceptional lesions that are difficult to diagnose before operating and/or obtaining pathological findings. The pathological classification and extent of surgical resection may play a key role in the prognosis. Once this type of lesion is suspected, the transfrontal approach may achieve preferable exposure and resection. Complete surgical resection may be sufficient for relatively benign lesions; otherwise, stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy is indicated. More cases should be reported to improve the treatment strategy.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,British journal of neurosurgery,10.3109/02688697.2014.967752,,melanocytic tumor; pituitary macroadenoma; primary; sellar; transfrontal,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

However, it is widely accepted that the developing cortex has superior capacities to reorganize following an early lesion to endorse adaptive plasticity. Here we report a single patient case (G.S.) with near normal central field vision despite a massive unilateral lesion to the optic radiations acquired early in life. The patient underwent surgical removal of a right hemisphere parieto-temporal-occipital atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the right lateral ventricle at four months of age, which presumably altered the visual pathways during in utero development. Both the tumor and surgery severely compromised the optic radiations. Residual vision of G.S. was tested psychophysically when the patient was 7 years old. We found a close-to-normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity within the central 25° and a great impairment in form and contrast vision in the far periphery (40-50°) of the left visual hemifield. BOLD response to full field luminance flicker was recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) and in a region in the residual temporal-occipital region, presumably corresponding to the middle temporal complex (MT+), of the lesioned (right) hemisphere. A population receptive field analysis of the BOLD responses to contrast modulated stimuli revealed a retinotopic organization just for the MT+ region but not for the calcarine regions. Interestingly, consistent islands of ipsilateral activity were found in MT+ and in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) of the intact hemisphere. Probabilistic tractography revealed that optic radiations between LGN and V1 were very sparse in the lesioned hemisphere consistently with the post-surgery cerebral resection, while normal in the intact hemisphere. On the other hand, strong structural connections between MT+ and LGN were found in the lesioned hemisphere, while the equivalent tract in the spared hemisphere showed minimal structural connectivity. These results suggest that during development of the pathological brain, abnormal thalamic projections can lead to functional cortical changes, which may mediate functional recovery of vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.033,,Contrast sensitivity; Cortical reorganization; DTI; Early brain lesion; Hemianopia; Neural plasticity; Retinotopic map; Visual cortex; fMRI; pRF,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

27450929,The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect dyslexia.,"Ptak, Radek; Di Pietro, Marie; Pignat, Jean-Michel",Ptak,"The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed bilateral decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule with the superior and middle temporal cortex. These findings suggest that parieto-temporal connections play a significant role for the deployment of attention within words during reading.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.07.033,,Disconnection; Neglect dyslexia; Parietal lobe; Reading; Spatial neglect; Temporal lobe; Visual attention,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
9549486,The Riddoch syndrome: insights into the neurobiology of conscious vision.,"Zeki, S; Ffytche, D H",Zeki,"We have studied a patient, G.Y., who was rendered hemianopic following a lesion affecting the primary visual cortex (area VI), sustained 31 years ago, with the hope of characterizing his ability to discriminate visual stimuli presented in his blind field, both psychophysically and in terms of the brain activity revealed by imaging methods. Our results show that (i) there is a correlation between G.Y.'s capacity to discriminate stimuli presented in his blind field and his conscious awareness of the same stimuli and (ii) that G.Y.'s performance on some tasks is characterized by a marked variability, both in terms of his awareness for a given level of discrimination and in his discrimination for a given level of awareness. The observations on G.Y., and a comparison of his capacities with those of normal subjects, leads us to propose a simple model of the relationship between visual discrimination and awareness. This supposes that the two independent capacities are very tightly coupled in normal subjects (gnosopsia) and that the effect of a VI lesion is to uncouple them, but only slightly. This uncoupling leads to two symmetrical departures, on the one hand to gnosanopsia (awareness without discrimination) and on the other to agnosopsia (discrimination without awareness). Our functional MRI studies show that V5 is always active when moving stimuli, whether slow or fast, are presented to his blind field and that the activity in V5 co-varies with less intense activity in other cortical areas. The difference in cerebral activity between gnosopsia and agnosopsia is that, in the latter, the activity in V5 is less intense and lower statistical thresholds are required to demonstrate it. Direct comparison of the brain activity during individual 'aware' and 'unaware' trials, corrected for the confounding effects of motion, has also allowed us, for the first time, to titrate conscious awareness against brain activity and show that there is a straightforward relationship between awareness and activity, both in individual cortical areas, in this case area V5, and in the reticular activating system. The imaging evidence, together with the variability in his levels of awareness and discrimination, manifested in his capacity to discriminate consciously on some occasions and unconsciously on others, leads us to conclude that agnosopsia, gnosopsia and gnosanopsia are all manifestations of a single condition which we call the Riddoch syndrome, in deference to the British neurologist who, in 1917, first characterized the major aspect of this disability. We discuss the significance of these results in relation to historical views about the organization of the visual brain.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/121.1.25,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

On initial MRI a grade 4 arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was identified in the right occipital lobe, which was further characterized by catheter angiography. Continued worsening of the headache in the following days prompted a follow-up MRI, which revealed a new T2 hypointense nodule and adjacent vasogenic edema in the periphery of the AVM. A follow-up MRI showed a marked increase in the size of the nodule with intrinsic enhancement and worsening perilesional edema. Based on the imaging evolution, the nodule was diagnosed as a metastasis and the patient was started on chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One week after the MRI he developed a sudden hemorrhage within the mass requiring decompression craniectomy and resection of both AVM and tumor.

However, partial syndromes without a decrease in the level of consciousness or brainstem signs exist, which may lead to initial misdiagnoses. The spectrum of clinical symptoms reflects the degree of venous congestion, which depends not only on the extent of thrombosis in the deep veins but also on the territory of the involved vessels and the establishment of venous collaterals. For example, thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins with (partially) patent basal veins and sufficient collaterals may result in relatively mild symptoms. Deep cerebral venous system thrombosis is an underdiagnosed condition when symptoms are mild, even in the presence of a venous hemorrhagic congestion. Identification of venous obstruction has important therapeutic implications. The diagnosis should be strongly suspected if the patient is a young woman, if the lesion is within the basal ganglia or thalamus, and especially if it is bilateral.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/01.wnl.0000179677.84785.63,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The purposes of this study were to describe the unusual presentation of bilateral homonymous visual field defects in three patients with bilateral ischemic strokes and to discuss the clinical and neuroanatomical correlations. Neuro-ophthalmological examination including perimetry and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in three patients with bilateral homonymous scotomas. Two of three patients presented with superior altitudinal hemianopia, resulting from right and left homonymous superior quadrantanopia due to bilateral occipital strokes below the calcarine fissure. A 57-year-old man (patient 1) with a history of atrial fibrillation presented with driving difficulties. Perimetry revealed bilateral superior altitudinal hemianopia. Brain MRI demonstrated a subacute right occipital stroke and a chronic left occipital stroke, both inferior to the calcarine fissure. An 83-year-old woman (patient 2) presented with reading disorders. Perimetry showed a left incomplete homonymous hemianopia and a right horizontal wedge-shaped homonymous scotoma. Brain MRI showed a chronic ischemic stroke in the left occipital lobe and acute ischemia in the right thalamus. A 40-year-old man (patient 3) was referred with headache, disorientation, and bilateral blurry vision. Perimetry showed bilateral superior altitudinal hemianopia, and MRI demonstrated acute bilateral occipital ischemia. Patients 1 and 2 suffered sequential bilateral strokes and were not aware of the initial scotoma, whereas patient 3 presented with bilateral concurrent strokes.

Here, we present a case of choroid plexus arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which the capsulothalamic artery originated from distal plexal segment of the AChoA. Clinical presentation A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation involving the left inferior horn in screening MRI. Preceding stereotactic radiosurgery, transarterial target embolization was performed. In this procedure, 20% n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) was successfully injected from the lateral plexal branch of the AChoA. After embolization, right homonymous hemianopsia developed due to cerebral infarction on the left optic radiation. This infarction was considered to be within the territory of the capsulothalamic artery. Conclusion This anomalous capsulothalamic artery might be formed by hemodynamic compromise of the brain surrounding AVM in early gestation.

The reliance on a lexical-semantic strategy in spelling, semantic errors, and impaired phonology and syntax were all highly consistent with the general characteristics of right hemisphere language, as revealed by studies of split-brain patients and adults with dominant hemispherectomy. In addition, this pattern of writing closely resembled the syndrome of deep agraphia.

In a letter/digit classification task, the patient responded accurately to targets presented in the upper visual field, for all horizontal eccentricities. In the lower visual field, she failed to discriminate letters from digits when targets were presented in the right, but not the left visual field (RVF and LVF, respectively). This pattern was also true for the foveal targets, with poor performance to foveal-RVF (0.5 degrees to the right of fixation) but not foveal-LVF (0.5 degrees to the left of fixation) targets. Similar patterns of normal performance to LVF but not RVF or foveal-RVF targets were observed in a group of nine normal observers when TMS was applied over their left occipital cortex. Complementary impairments to LVF and foveal-LVF target classification were induced with TMS over the right occipital cortex. Thus, we have induced an hemianopic pattern in normal observers contralateral to the magnetically stimulated hemisphere. This correspondence between real and TMS-induced visual field defects is further evidence, in neurologically intact subjects, that the cortical representation of the fovea is split between the two hemispheres along the vertical meridian.",{},,Brain research.

In this study, we report on a patient with a cerebral infarct who showed recovery of visual field defect via the corpus callosum, using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for optic radiation (OR). A 57-year-old male patient underwent conservative management for a cerebral infarct in the subcortical white matter of the right temporal lobe. Left homonymous hemianopsia was detected on the 2-week Humphrey visual field test. However, the patient showed improvement of hemianopsia with time; consequently, a left lower peripheral visual defect with the resolution of the upper and medial portions of the initial left hemianopia was observed on the 11-month Humphrey visual field test. Both 2-week and 11-month DTTs for the right OR showed a discontinuation between the right lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the right OR. On 2-week DTT, the left OR was connected to the transcallosal fibres, and on 11-month DTT, these transcallosal fibres were elongated to the right primary visual cortex via the right posterior OR. The visual field defect in this patient appears to have recovered by the neural pathway originating from the left OR and terminating in the primary visual cortex via the transcallosal fibres and right distal OR.

Neurologic examination, MRI, CSF and serologic analyses, and brain biopsy were performed. Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsied brain tissue were stained with histologic and immunohistochemical stains. Biopsy revealed an inflammatory subpial lesion containing lymphocytes and myelin-laden macrophages. Recurrent relapses with dissemination of MRI-typical white matter lesions characterized the subsequent course. Our findings highlight that cortical demyelination occurs on a background of inflammation and suggest that the noninflammatory character of chronic cortical demyelination may relate to long intervals between lesion formation and autopsy. This case provides pathologic evidence of relapsing-remitting MS presenting with inflammatory cortical demyelination and emphasizes the importance of considering demyelinating disease in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with a solitary cortical enhancing lesion.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0b013e31821a44f1,PMC3100131,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The etiology of monocular temporal hemianopia has been well-evaluated and has been suggested to result from an optic nerve or chiasmal lesion. However, the etiology of monocular nasal hemianopia remains unclear. Here, we present the case of a 41-year-old male who was punched on the head with fists during a fight and then suffered from painless blurred vision in the left eye after mild traumatic brain injury. An ophthalmic examination revealed a conjunctival chemosis, periorbital hematoma, and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. Automated perimetry indicated there was a left side nasal hemianopia along the vertical meridian. Examination of the fundus showed there was a normal appearing retina and disc bilaterally. Fluorescein angiography revealed no delayed filling of the vessels. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed unremarkable findings of the visual pathways, orbit, and brain. A diagnosis of left traumatic optic neuropathy was made. Systemic steroid pulse therapy (1 gram of intravenous methylprednisolone per day) was given to the patient for 3 days. An ophthalmologic examination after treatment indicated there was no obvious improvement in the relative afferent pupillary defect, best corrected visual acuity, and color sense. A second set of automated perimetry results showedno changes after 3 months. Monocular nasal hemianopia caused by traumatic optic neuropathy is uncommon. In this case, monocular nasal hemianopia was likely due to ischemic changes from impairment of the prechiasmal arterial anastomotic network or indirect injury to the lateral prechiasmal nerve fiber.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000021352,PMC7386976,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Aggressive behavior was found in 3 patients (7.3%) among 41 patients with posterior cerebral artery stroke. One patient had right occipitotemporal and ventrolateral thalamic stroke. The second patient had left occipitotemporal and lateral thalamic stroke. The third patient had right isolated occipital stroke. In addition to a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, the patients, who were physically and emotionally balanced before the stroke, suddenly manifested an acute, unusual, aggressive behavior. The patients became agitated and aggressive when they were stimulated by the environment, and they responded to solicitation by their relatives or medical personnel by shouting obscenities and hitting and biting others. In all of the 3 cases, temporary physical restraint was required and neuroleptics were administered. This unusual behavioral pattern resolved within 2 weeks after stroke. Aggressive behavior is a rare presentation of acute posterior cerebral artery stroke, which may be difficult to diagnose in patients presenting with hemianopsia as the only concomitant neurological sign.

This concern is especially acute in patients with a preexisting visual deficit. Approaches that involve mechanical retraction of the occipital lobe further threaten visual function. The supracerebellar transtentorial (SCTT) approach, which does not carry a risk of occipital retraction injury, should be considered for patients with occipital tentorial meningiomas to maximize functional visual outcomes. A 54-yr-old woman underwent 2 resections and radiation therapy for a right occipital oligodendroglioma as a teenager. She was left with a complete left homonymous hemianopsia. The patient now presented with progressive vision loss in her remaining right visual field. Imaging revealed a left occipital superiorly projecting tentorial meningioma. To preserve her remaining visual function the SCTT approach was chosen for resection. A Simpson grade 1 removal was achieved without disrupting the occipital lobe pia or requiring mechanical cerebellar retraction. A diagnosis of a WHO grade II meningioma (presumably radiation induced) was made. The patient's vision returned to premorbid baseline 1 wk after surgery. The SCTT approach should be considered for the surgical management of patients with occipital tentorial meningiomas when visual preservation is at risk.

To define a new inflammatory demyelinating disease unlike MS or CIDP. This study reports on five patients with a demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Each case presented a relapsing-remitting course in which CNS involvement preceded PNS involvement. All patients fulfilled Barkhof's criteria on MRI and the McDonald criteria for MS. Two patients had grey matter lesions with typical white matter changes. No systemic inflammatory disease and no metabolic or inflammatory factor for peripheral neuropathy were found. In all cases electromyography showed a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy without conduction block. Four patients fulfilled the European Federation of Neurological Societies/PNS guideline for CIDP and Nicolas et al's criteria for CIDP, one of whom also fulfilled the Ad Hoc Subcommittee criteria for CIDP. Nerve biopsy, performed in two patients, showed histological evidence of CIDP. An improvement in clinical status and neurophysiological parameters was observed in three patients after treatment with either intravenous immunoglobulin (n = 1) or cyclophosphamide (n = 2). The CNS and PNS demyelination, the absence of oligoclonal bands and the peripheral demyelination without conduction block indicate pathogenic mechanisms different from MS and CIDP. The chronology of events suggests an entity unlike that involved in acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Immunological reactivity against antigens common to peripheral and central myelin may explain why the demyelinating disease affected both the CNS and PNS.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2006.108290,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Homonymous hemianopia (HH) has rarely been described in this syndrome. We report on six patients (four females, two males, aged 63 to 80) referred for visual disorder which led to demonstration of HH using perimetry testing. These patients were followed for 1 to 5 years after discovery of HH. Brain imaging with MRI or CT scan was obtained in the six cases and a SPECT scan was performed in four cases. HH was left-sided in four cases and right-sided in two cases. Associated symptoms related to higher visual dysfunction were simultagnosia, alone or as part of a full Balint's syndrome, alexia, constructional apraxia, dressing apraxia, visual form agnosia, prosopagnosia and hemispatial neglect. These symptoms were mild at onset but invariably worsened with disease progression. Dementia eventually developed in all cases. The clinical diagnosis was probable Alzheimer's disease in five cases and corticobasal degeneration in one case. Radiology showed posterior cortex atrophy in all cases as well as reduced cerebral blood flow in the same region, with an asymmetrical pattern compatible with the side of HH. Elementary cortical lesions in PCA can develop mainly in the associative visual areas and even in the primary visual area, resulting in HH. HH has rarely been documented in PCA, but its prevalence would probably be higher if systematic search was conducted. Apparently isolated HH of insidious onset should suggest PCA and lead to neuropsychological testing and search for discrete atrophic changes of the posterior cortex on MRI as well as for metabolic alterations with SPECT or PET.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2008.10.010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of improvement in hemianopsia after surgery for metastatic brain tumors involving or adjacent to the optic radiation (OR). The study included 49 patients with brain metastasis in the parietal and occipital lobes in the present study. Preoperative and postoperative neurological assessments included visual field, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Karnofsky performance scale. Of 49 patients, 33 (67.3%) presented with preoperative homonymous hemianopsia. Of these 33 patients, the visual field was improved postoperatively in 17 patients (51.5%). In all patients regardless of preoperative hemianopsia, postoperative visual fields did not deteriorate. Tractography demonstrated that the OR was split by the tumor (n = 6) and fanning of fibers expanded along the lateral side of the tumor (n = 11). All tumors were removed via surgical access toward the medial side of the tumor. Gross total resection was achieved in most tumors in the group with visual improvement (n = 16/17; 94.1%). Improvement in the visual field was attributed to tumor location in the subcortical white matter, removal rate of the tumor, and higher postoperative Karnofsky performance scale score. The OR tended to deviate to the lateral side of the tumor in the parieto-occipital junction. The postoperative visual field improved even in cases of an occipital tumor. Based on the present study, total resection via an appropriate surgical route should be considered to preserve the OR, leading to improvement in the postoperative visual field.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.09.029,,Hemianopsia; Metastatic brain tumor; Optic radiation; Parieto-occipital junction; Surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Delayed FLAIR images, obtained 12 hours later without additional gadolinium, showed prominent CSF space enhancement without parenchymal changes. Delayed gadolinium enhancement of the CSF space on FLAIR imaging was resolved in parallel to clinical improvement during the 2 months' follow-up. Delayed gadolinium enhancement was first observed in patients with acute infarction who underwent thrombolytic therapy, and it has been considered a marker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption associated with reperfusion injury.

A 30 year old woman had been unwell for 4 months with difficulty focusing, vertigo, dizziness and a feeling of falling to the right. A small but congruous right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia was found on examination leading to further investigation that uncovered a vertebral artery dissection and multiple posterior circulation infarctions including a left occipital stroke matching the field defect. We describe an atypical case of VAD presenting with a small congruous quadrantanopia. This is a rare but significant condition that predisposes to multiple thromboembolic infarction that may be easily misdiagnosed and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,BMC ophthalmology,10.1186/1471-2415-10-14,PMC2885997,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

11101127,Bilateral occipital lobe stroke with inferior altitudinal defects.,"Holt, L J; Anderson, S F",Holt,"Cerebrovascular disease is the most common cause of neurological disability in Western countries. Patients who survive cerebrovascular accidents exclusive to the occipital lobe often have no significant neurological deficits other than visual-field loss. Visual-field defects from occipital lobe stroke typically include congruous homonymous hemianopsias or quadranopsias, with or without macular sparing. A 61-year-old white man came to us with symptoms of sudden loss of vision and difficulty reading. Visual-field testing revealed a bilateral inferior altitudinal defect with normal optic nerve and fundus appearance in both eyes. On radiological examination, he was found to have had a bioccipital lobe cerebrovascular accident secondary to complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery. An embolic event causing the artery occlusion, in combination with bilaterally compromised cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries, presumably caused the bilateral stroke. After appropriate medical and neurological consultation, optometric management consisted of maximizing the patient's remaining vision with a prismatic spectacle correction. Patients with infarction exclusive to the occipital lobe typically have no other neurological deficits except visual-field loss and are often easier to manage than patients with infarctions to other areas of the cerebral cortex or multiple infarctions. Visual-field loss from occipital lobe damage can be successfully managed with optical systems and/or visual rehabilitation. Factors related to management include location and extent of visual-field damage, functional visual needs, and both personal and health concerns of the patient.

A dissociation between colour and motion in blindsight.,"Chabanat, E; Jacquin-Courtois, S; Havé, L; Kihoulou, C; Tilikete, C; Mauguière, F; Rheims, S; Rossetti, Y",Chabanat,"Blindsight has been primarily and extensively studied by Lawrence Weiskrantz. Residual visual abilities following a hemispheric lesion leading to homonymous hemianopia encompass a variety of visual-perceptual and visuo-motor functions. Attention blindsight produces the more salient subjective experiences, especially for motion (Riddoch phenomenon). Action blindsight illustrates visuo-motor abilities despite the patients' feeling that they produce random movements. Perception blindsight seems to be the weakest residual function observed in blindsight, e.g. for wavelength sensitivity. Discriminating motion produced by isoluminant colours does not give rise to blindsight for motion but the outcome of the reciprocal test is not known. Here we tested whether moving stimuli could give rise to colour discrimination in a patient with homonymous hemianopia. It was found that even though the patient exhibited nearly perfect performances for motion direction discrimination his colour discrimination for the same moving stimulus remained at chance level. It is concluded that easily discriminated moving stimuli do not give rise to colour discrimination and implications for the 3 levels of blindsight taxonomy are discussed.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.08.006,,Attention-blindsight; Colour; Cortical blindness; Dorsal stream; Motion; Perception-blindsight; Vision,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
2331128,Bilateral altitudinal visual fields.,"Lakhanpal, A; Selhorst, J B",Lakhanpal,"We describe two patients with absolute, complete, binocular inferior altitudinal hemianopias. These altitudinal visual-field defects (AVFDs) involved both nasal and adjacent temporal quadrants and respected the horizontal meridian. The reported conditions and locations in the visual system that cause ""conventional"" AVFDs and their bilateral occurrence are reviewed. Division of the visual system into altitudinal halves results from the topographic arrangement of nerve fibers and their blood supply in the retina, optic nerves, and visual cortex. Lesions at these locations resulting in AVFDs are usually due to vascular occlusion or may result from a penetrating missile injury to the superior occipital lobes. It is important to emphasize that the nerve fiber layer of the retina respects the horizontal meridian only in the nasal field, not in the temporal field; therefore incomplete AVFD is more common. Because of the anastomotic blood supply of the occipital pole, only AVFDs due to occipital infarcts spare fixation. Diagnosis of retinal branch artery occlusion or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is aided by the presence of a unilateral AVFD along with ipsilateral funduscopic abnormalities and, in most bilateral examples, by its sequential temporal development. Bilateral occipital infarcts, as in our two cases, are characterized by sudden, simultaneous onset of AVFDs, an absence of retinal, retinovascular, or optic nerve abnormality and confirmation by computed tomographic scanning.",{},,Annals of ophthalmology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This is suggested by patients who recognize the global form of the left side of shapes (the forest) but fail to cancel out its local details (the trees). Here we report the opposite behavioural dissociation in a patient (Q.M.) with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. Q.M. detected local details (such as the tail of a dog) on the left or right side of visual shapes, regardless of whether these details belonged to predefined target shapes (a dog in this case) or to distractor shapes differing on the opposite side (a dog with a swan's neck and head, for example). Psychological testing showed an abnormal tendency of this patient to respond to local features, but perfect accuracy in interpreting global features when the local features could not interfere in global processing. The results indicate that the left hemisphere can integrate multiple local features simultaneously but loses global awareness as soon as local features individually compete for response selection.

On MRI, a left occipital lesion with mild enhancement after gadolinium infusion on the T1-weighted image, bright signal with some mass effect on the T2-weighted image, and the diffusion-weighted imaging suggested a diagnosis of an acute infarct. With the use of the exponential image technique, the T2 hyperintense signal present on the diffusion study was almost completely eliminated, changing the diagnosis and treatment plan. Subsequent examinations and MRI confirmed the diagnosis of demyelinating disease. In diseases such as cerebral ischemia and demyelination, MRI diffusion is often abnormal because such diseases modify the integrity of central nervous system structures.

21763441,Awareness-related activity in prefrontal and parietal cortices in blindsight reflects more than superior visual performance.,"Persaud, Navindra; Davidson, Matthew; Maniscalco, Brian; Mobbs, Dean; Passingham, Richard E; Cowey, Alan; Lau, Hakwan",Persaud,"Many imaging studies report activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortices when subjects are aware as opposed to unaware of visual stimuli. One possibility is that this activity simply reflects higher signal strength or the superior task performance that is associated with awareness. To find out, we studied the hemianope GY who has unilateral destruction of almost all primary visual cortices. He exhibits 'blindsight', that is, he claims to have no conscious visual phenomenology (i.e., no visual qualia), for stationary stimuli presented to his right visual field (the blind field), although he can press keys to distinguish between different stimuli presented there. We presented to him a visual discrimination task, and equated performance for stimuli presented to the left or right visual field by presenting low contrast stimuli to his normal (left) field and high contrast stimuli to his blind (right) field. Superior accuracy can be a serious confound, and our paradigm allows us to control for it and avoid this confound. Even when performance was matched, and the signal strength was lower, visual stimulation to the normal (conscious) field led to higher activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortices. These results indicate that the activity in the prefrontal and parietal areas that has been reported in previous studies of awareness is not just due to a (signal strength or performance) confounds. One possibility is that it reflects the superior 'metacognitive' capacity that is associated with awareness, because GY was better able to distinguish between his own correct and incorrect responses for stimuli presented to his normal field than to his blind field.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,NeuroImage,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.081,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The initial left-sided infarct induced right visual neglect, impairment of right-beating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optic ataxia, Gerstmann's syndrome and apraxia. After the right-sided infarct, which occurred six weeks later, bilateral visuo-oculomotor disturbances were observed, including peripheral visual inattention, disorder of visually guided saccades, severe impairment of foveal smooth pursuit and OKN slow phase. The lesion on the left involved the upper part of the angular gyrus and a part of the adjacent superior parietal lobule (SPL). That on the right involved the supramarginal gyrus and extended posteriorly into the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, into both margins of the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and into a small part of the SPL. As the oculomotor deficits and the peripheral visual inattention were bilateral after the second infarct, they probably resulted from the lesion of homologous areas in both cerebral hemispheres. The zone damaged in common included a small part of the SPL, the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, and the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and a small portion of the subcortical white matter. This restricted cerebral zone could therefore, in man, be implicated both in the control of all visually guided eye movements and in visual attention. It is further suggested that two corticofugal pathways are implicated in visually guided saccades, the first arising from the frontal eye fields and projecting directly onto the premotor structures in the brainstem, the second arising from the posterior parietal cortex (probably mainly the intraparietal sulcus adjacent to the angular gyrus) and including a relay in the superior colliculus before reaching the premotor structures.

An online visual field test (an 'app') was developed as part of a free to use web based therapy site for patients with hemianopic alexia, called Read-Right (http://www.readright.ucl.ac.uk). This study is an attempt to validate this test by comparing with a clinical 'gold standard'-the Humphrey automated visual field analyser. 22 patients had their visual fields assessed with both techniques on the same day. The criterion validity of the Read-Right was examined by comparing it with Humphrey 10-2 and 24-2 perimetry using the following measures: (1) sensitivity and specificity; (2) κ statistics; and (3) intraclass correlation. Read-Right demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, particularly for the undamaged field. In the damaged field, κ values were highly significant, especially for points along the horizontal meridian. The intraclass correlation score for the damaged field indicated excellent correlation between the two tests. Read-Right perimetry performed well on all measures. It had a tendency to under call damaged points offset from the horizontal meridian, and this and other aspects of the test will be revamped.

Hallucinations were accompanied by palinopsia in 2 cases, metamorphopsia in one case and constriction of one pupil in another case. This particular type of hallucination is considered as an irritative phenomenon of the visual association cortex which can be symptomatic of a parieto-occipital lesion and does not necessarily implicate the temporal lobes. Distinctive features about the visions were that they consisted of people, animals or objects. There was no auditory accompaniment and any action that took place was stereotyped and did not tell a story. In most cases, the hallucinations were not clearly related to any visual memory. It is suggested that the visual association cortex amy be responsible for the organization of visual percepts into broad categories of which people, animals and objects are representative.

Subjects moved their eyes so that a cue and a target presented at the same spatial location were imaged successively onto blind and seeing portions of their retinas. One hemianopic patient showed a similar IOR effect from cues presented within both the seeing and the hemianopic fields. With a second hemianopic patient, only presentations of the cue to the subject's seeing field produced IOR. The explanation for this discrepancy is not evident.

It is suggested that bilateral destruction of the lingual gyrus alone is not sufficient to affect complex visual processing. The fusiform gyrus probably has a critical role in colour integration, visuo-spatial processing, facial recognition and corresponding visual imagery. Involvement of the occipitotemporal projection system deep to the lingual gyri probably explained visual memory dysfunction, by a visuo-limbic disconnection. Impaired verbal memory may have been due to posterior involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus and underlying white matter, which may have disconnected the intact speech areas from the left medial temporal structures.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.50.5.607,PMC1031973,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

SWS without facial nevus was diagnosed based on calcification detected by CT and pial angioma detected by enhanced MRI. His migraine-like headaches were preceded by left homonymous hemianopsia, which persisted for more than 60 min. Although homonymous hemianopsia disappeared with cessation of the headache until 13 years of age, from age 14 years onward, this homonymous hemianopsia persisted after the headaches ended. Moreover, reduced cerebral blood flow was seen in the right occipital area on SPECT. At first, his left homonymous hemianopsia persisted for several months after the headache disappeared, but it had recovered completely. However, the durations of episodes of left homonymous hemianopsia, which persisted after headache disappearance, gradually became longer. At last one year after his first admission, the visual defect had become permanent. SWS is well known to be associated with migraine attacks and hemianopsia. However, the course of our present patient, i.e. recurrent homonymous hemianopsia, associated with migraine-like headaches becoming permanent, is rare. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this clinical course is uncertain. The efficacy of valproate and propranolol as preventive therapy has been inadequate, to date.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Brain & development,10.1016/j.braindev.2009.09.002,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

To investigate the relationship between degree of awareness and those factors that might be responsible for the unawareness, including the aspects listed above. Four patients with visual field defects caused by a brain lesion after a stroke was investigated. Self rating of emotional state, search performance for an object among many placed on a table, and for text reading, as well as visual field, visual positive phenomena, and hemispatial neglect were evaluated. Degree of unawareness for field loss was evaluated by modified version of the method of Bisiach et al. (1985). In addition, the episodes when the patient became aware of the defect were asked. In accordance with the previous studies, we found no relationship between the degree of awareness of field defect and anatomic lesions, co-existence of hemispatial neglect, or the degree of awareness of hemiplegia. However, the patient with neglect was unaware of their troubles in vision at all, whereas the patients without neglect were aware of the troubles but misinterpreted them as problems of the eyes including acuity. In accordance with previous studies, co-existence of visual hallucinations or illusions seemed to be associated with awareness of visual field defect. No relationship was found between the degree of awareness of field defect and emotional state, degree of field loss, degree of defective visual search, or severity of hemianopic dyslexia. Their responses to the inquiry about the degree of awareness of field defect were not consistent. Thus, the awareness of the field defect seemed to be difficult to be kept firmly in their mind. On the other hand, the patients could remember the episode when they became aware of the defect for the first time, being able to specify time, place, and situation. Levine (1990) suggested that the sensory loss in this sort of patients was never phenomenally immediate but instead must be discovered by observation and inference. Non-specificity of the lesion, qualitative difference in awareness between the patient with and without hemispatial neglect, association of positive visual phenomena and awareness, fluctuation of awareness, and dependence of awareness on personal experiences found in our patients, can be explained with this 'discovery' hypothesis.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Selective interruption of the dual blood supply to the lateral geniculate nucleus (with the anterior choroidal artery supplying the anterior hilus, together with the anterior and lateral nucleus and the lateral choroidal artery supplying the remainder of the nucleus) may result in a congruous visual field defect with steeply sloping borders because such a lesion must respect the anatomic boundaries produced by this vascular supply. Partial infiltration or involvement of the lateral geniculate nucleus (where uncrossed retinal projections terminate in one group of laminae, while crossed retinal projections terminate in another) provides a logical explanation for the occurrence of incongruous visual field defects. This unusual horizontal wedge-shaped defect should suggest lateral geniculate nucleus involvement, especially in the absence of trauma.",{},,American journal of ophthalmology,10.1016/0002-9394(84)90317-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Previous studies suggest that obstacle avoidance relies on mechanisms in the dorsal visual stream in the posterior parietal cortex. One fundamental question that remains unanswered is where the visual inputs to these dorsal-stream mechanisms are coming from. Here, we provide compelling evidence that these mechanisms can operate in ""real-time"" without direct input from primary visual cortex (V1). In our first experiment, we used a reaching task to demonstrate that an individual with a dense left visual field hemianopia after damage to V1 remained strikingly sensitive to the position of unseen static obstacles placed in his blind field. Importantly, in a second experiment, we showed that his sensitivity to the same obstacles in his blind field was abolished when a short 2-s delay (without vision) was introduced before reach onset. These findings have far-reaching implications, not only for our understanding of the time constraints under which different visual pathways operate, but also in relation to how these seemingly ""primitive"" subcortical visual pathways can control complex everyday behavior without recourse to conscious vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.0905549106,PMC2747232,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.",{},,NeuroImage,10.1006/nimg.1998.0390,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Six years before admission to our department the patient complained that prolonged rotation to the right caused vertigo and nausea accompanied by right-sided hemianopia and transient right-sided hemiparesis. At that time, no treatment was recommended and hemianopia did not improve spontaneously. The patient was referred to our department in 2002. Angiography disclosed normal carotid arteries, occlusion of the right VA, while the left VA was patent in the neutral position. However, during head rotation to the right, the artery became occluded at the C1-2 level. The left vertebral artery at level C1-2 was decompressed. Postoperative angiography indicated patent left VA, both in the neutral position and during maximal rotation to the right. The patient is symptom-free for more than 24 months. Surgical treatment of bow hunter's syndrome is easy and effective; this case should draw more attention to a very rare cause of VBI. The authors believe that vertebral artery decompression represents a more physiological treatment modality, and hence decompression is recommended as a first-line procedure.",{},,Zentralblatt fur Neurochirurgie,10.1055/s-2005-836600,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

We present a case of an incidental, nonruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm, which was successfully occluded by coil embolization after a bypass between the occipital artery and the distal posterior cerebral artery was created. MR imaging in a neurologically normal 26-year-old man, performed in the course of a work-up for nonrelated symptoms, incidentally revealed a partially thrombosed and calcified aneurysm of the left posterior cerebral artery (P2 segment). This was confirmed by angiography. Due to aneurysm configuration and localization in the asymptomatic patient, primary clipping or endovascular occlusion was considered to be too hazardous. Four weeks after successful microvascular connection of the left occipital artery to the distal posterior cerebral artery, the PCA was occluded at the level of the aneurysm with a detachable coil. The patient remained asymptomatic, without visual field defects. The above presented combined microvascular (bypass) and endovascular (coil embolization) treatment with excellent result should be considered as alternative in patients with nonruptured, asymptomatic P2 aneurysms, which are high risk for primary clipping or endovascular occlusion.",{},,Zentralblatt fur Neurochirurgie,10.1055/s-2000-11000,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Extinction occurred during double simultaneous stimulation within the same visual hemi-field (VHF). This finding suggests that interhemispheric rivalry is not a critical factor. During double simultaneous stimulation within the same VHF as well as with stimuli in different VHFs, the severity of extinction was determined by both the retinotopic and the hemi-spatial position of the extinguished stimulus. The location of the other stimulus, however, did not seem relevant. It is proposed that damage to a corticolimbic-reticular system reduces attentional capacity and that extinction during double simultaneous stimulation in the visual modality reflects an inability to distribute the limited attentional resources equally to two different locations. The severity of extinction is a measure of an unequal distribution of attention along a gradient within visual space.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.50.9.1117,PMC1032341,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

A 31-year-old patient, who underwent a surgical procedure for resection of the AVM, was referred with posterior low vision on the left side. The patient was diagnosed with left homonymous hemianopia. Visual neurorehabilitation therapy (NRT), which integrated restorative and compensatory approaches, was administered for 3 hours each week. NRT included fixation, follow-up, search, peripheral vision, and reading. The NRT did not change visual field defects and, retinotopocally, the same campimetric defects remained. However, after training the tracking ocular movements improved to standard values on the ENG, further, the visual search became more organized. The reading reached a level without mistakes, with rhythm and goog intonation. The Beck test demostrated an improvement in depression symptoms. Regarding the daily life activities, the patient reported significant improvements. Visual NRT can significantly improve eye movements, as well as the quality of life and independence of the patient.

Goldmann VF perimetry revealed left homonymous hemianopia, but central VF was intact. Three months after the onset of infarction, we measured cerebral glucose metabolism with FDG and FMZ binding using PET. FMZ binding reflects the density of surviving neurons. Moreover, eight months after the onset, FDG-PET scan was performed. Goldmann VF perimetry was also performed at the same times of PET examinations. Decrease of cerebral glucose metabolism in the right anterior striate cortex was observed at three months after onset, while FMZ binding in the same area did not decrease in the patient. At eight months after onset, we observed recovery of VF and improvement of cerebral glucose metabolism in the anterior striate cortex. We presented change of cerebral glucose metabolism using PET accompanying improvement of VF.

Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was completed at intervals that ranged between 8 and 42 days for a duration of 119 days. A comparison to the pre-trauma SD-OCT 10 months before revealed progressive thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in both eyes over multiple follow-ups post-trauma. Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing revealed an incomplete congruous right homonymous hemianopsia that gradually improved over the follow-ups. Analysis of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness displayed loss that corresponded to the pattern of visual field defect. TRD can occur as soon as 2 months after severe TBI with damage posterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Progressive RNFL loss can be tracked with SD-OCT, and the rate of thinning may slowly stabilize over time.

This phenomenon was first described in 1760 by Charles Bonnet and others during their observations of elderly patients with degeneration of the retina or cornea. To date a clear association between visual hallucinations and neurosurgical procedures has not been reported. Because of their clear demarcation, however, surgical lesions in the cerebrum offer a unique opportunity to determine the pathoanatomical aspects of visual hallucinations. During a 3-year period, 41 consecutive patients who acquired visual field defects after neurosurgery were examined for the occurrence of visual hallucination. Postoperatively, four of these patients experienced visual hallucinations. In two of them an upper quadrantanopia developed after the patients had undergone selective amygdalohippocampectomy. In the other two patients a complete hemianopia developed, in one case after resection of a parietal astrocytoma and in the other after resection of an occipital glioblastoma multiforme. The visual hallucinations were transient and gradually disappeared between 4 days and 6 months postoperatively. The patients were aware of the fact that their hallucinations were fictitious and displayed no psychosis. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained in only two patients and epileptic discharges were found. Deafferentiation of cortical association areas may lead to the spontaneous generation of complex visual phenomena. In the present series this phenomenon occurred in approximately 10% of patients with postoperative visual field defects. In all four cases the central optic radiation was damaged between the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex. The complex nature of the visual hallucination indicates that they were generated in visual association areas.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2004.101.5.0846,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Seven patients with homonymous hemianopia due to unilateral acquired post-geniculate visual pathway lesions were studied. The average duration from the onset of brain lesions to the initial visit was 49.8 months. Forty-nine normal control subjects without visual field defects, as confirmed using a Humphrey visual field analyzer, were also enrolled. Measurement of the cpRNFL thickness was performed at the initial visit and 24 months using SD-OCT (RTVue-100® OCT). The cpRNFL thickness was divided into eight sectors (superior temporal: ST, temporal upper: TU, temporal lower: TI, inferior temporal: IT, inferior nasal: IN, nasal lower: NL, nasal upper: NU, superior nasal: SN). The eye on the same side as the occipital lobe lesions was defined as the ipsilateral eye, and the eye on the opposite side was defined as the contralateral eye. The average cpRNFL thickness in the homonymous hemianopic eyes was significantly reduced as compared with that seen in the normal controls, except for the ipsilateral eyes at the initial visit. Four of the eight sectors of the cpRNFL thickness in the homonymous hemianopic eyes were significantly reduced compared with that noted in the normal controls. In the ipsilateral eyes, the cpRNFL thickness in the ST, TU, TL, and IT sectors was significantly reduced at both the initial visit and 24 months. In the contralateral eyes, the cpRNFL thickness in the TU, TL, IT, and SN sectors was significantly reduced at both the initial visit and 24 months. The reduction of the quadrantic cpRNFL thickness significantly correlated with some of the visual field parameters, in accordance with the structure-function relationship. In the contralateral eyes, the T and I quadrant cpRNFL thickness correlated with the mean deviation and hemianopic field total deviation at 24 months. In the ipsilateral eyes, the S, T, and I quadrant cpRNFL thickness correlated with mean deviation. However, there were no correlations between the cpRNFL thickness and visual field parameters at the initial visit. A reduction of the cpRNFL thickness corresponding to the hemianopic visual field loss due to acquired post-geniculate visual pathway lesions was detected using SD-OCT, and the change was more evident at 24 months than at the initial visit.

Two patients with right inferior homonymous paracentral scotoma were asked to describe their perception of a series of figures showing two isometric vertical lines symmetrically located on either side of a fixation point. In each figure, the fixation point varied by steps of 2 degrees along a hypothetical vertical line equidistant between the test lines. The lines subtended 20 degrees of visual angle, and the right line passed through the scotoma in both cases. Time for spatial distortion to manifest was recorded. Both subjects reported that the right line was perceived as shorter than the left one. The line shortening varied in magnitude with the distance of the fixation point from the end of the line and was more pronounced when the distance increased. Moreover, perceptual line shortening appeared 5-10 seconds after steady fixation, but values of shortening varied during the following 10 seconds.

The paucity of publications describing such visual field defects might be attributed to various factors, including the absence of severe symptoms, routine visual field assessment restricted to the central 30° with automated perimetry, and the collateral circulation to the occipital cortex. The aim of this study was to correlate the brain lesions and perimetric findings in 2 unusual cases of peripheral homonymous scotomas, with the anatomic location of the optic radiation and primary visual cortex. Two patients with circumscribed homonymous scotomas beyond 30° related to infarcts in the intermediate area of the visual cortex are reported. We describe a new strategy, which relies on modern lesion analysis and stereotaxic probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, to accurately correlate the brain lesion site with the location of the peripheral homonymous visual field defects. In Case 1, the posterior optic radiation was affected in its termination in the upper intermediate visual cortex. In Case 2, the lesion was located in the upper rostral portion of the primary visual cortex. In both, the most anterior part of the visual cortex and the occipital pole were intact, accounting for preservation of the central and most peripheral visual field. Additionally, correlation of the neuroimaging findings with commonly used maps of the representation of the visual field on the striate cortex suggested that our data were most consistent with the Holmes map.

As a result, the differential diagnosis of visual field defects and their etiology is important. A 64-year old white male was examined in follow up related to the surgical removal of a right temporal lobe abscess secondary to a childhood right side mastoidectomy. The patient underwent ophthalmic examination, which suggested possible changes in his field of vision, and neurobehavioral evaluation related to his visual field defect, a left homonymous superior quadrant defect. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast enhancement confirmed the ophthalmic diagnosis and correlated with the patient's medical history. However, neurobehavioral evaluation revealed a number of deficits that were believed to be associated with alcohol abuse.

28954971,"[Incongruous, incomplete, homonymous hemianopia due to an infarction localized to the lateral geniculate body].","Tanaka, Kanta; Wada, Ikko; Suenaga, Toshihiko",Tanaka,"A 45-year-old male was admitted with an acute-onset visual field defect. Goldmann perimetry revealed an incongruent, incomplete right homonymous hemianopia. The left eye showed a wedge-shaped, horizontal right hemianopia, whereas the right eye showed constriction of the right visual hemifield. MRI showed acute infarction localized to the left lateral geniculate body (LGB). LGB has a dual blood supply: from the anterior choroidal artery and from the lateral posterior choroidal artery (LPChA). The LPChA territory of LGB receives projection from the retinal area around the macula and horizontal meridian. Therefore, an LPChA territory infarction of LGB can cause a wedge-shaped, horizontal visual field defect. The visual field defect in our patient would be caused by an LPChA territory infarction of LGB. Our patient showed an incongruent homonymous hemianopia. LGB has six laminae, with the ipsilateral retinal fibers terminating in layers two, three, and five and the crossed fibers terminating in layers one, four, and six. The laminar structure provides the anatomical basis for the incongruous visual field defects in a case of partial lesion of LGB. Based on the present data, we believe that an ischemic lesion localized to LGB should be considered in patients presenting with incongruous, incomplete homonymous hemianopia.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001055,,congruency; lateral geniculate body; lateral posterior choroidal artery; sectoranopia; wedge-shaped visual field defect,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

The component letters of a string benefit when they form a familiar global object, rather than requiring representation as multiple separate objects.

Here we studied a left neglect patient with a right temporoparietal haemorrhage. On a nonlateralised, purely vertical SWM task, he was impaired in retaining spatial locations. In a visual search task, his eye position was monitored while his spatial memory was probed. He recursively searched through right stimuli, re-fixating previously inspected items, and critically treated them as if they were new discoveries, consistent with the SWM deficit. When his recovery was tracked over several months, his SWM deficit and left neglect showed concurrent improvements.

We prospectively followed clinical and radiographic courses of 13 patients undergoing laser ablation for focal epilepsy by the senior author (N.T.). Only patients with nonenhancing lesions and patients who had a delayed postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with gadolinium administration approximately 6 months after ablation were considered. Volumetric estimates of the amount of enhancement immediately after ablation and on the delayed MRI scan were made. Median interval between surgery and delayed postoperative MRI scan was 6 months (range, 5-8 months). In 12 of 13 cases, persistent enhancement was seen, consistent with prolonged blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Enhancement, when present, was 9%-67% (mean 30%). There was no correlation between the time from surgery and the relative percentage of postoperative enhancement on MRI. The blood-brain barrier remained compromised to gadolinium contrast for up to 8 months after thermal therapy. There were no adverse events from surgical intervention; however, 1 patient developed delayed optic neuritis. Prolonged incompetence of the blood-brain barrier produced by thermal ablation may provide a path for delivery of macromolecules into perilesional tissue, which could be exploited for therapeutic benefit, but rarely it may result in autoimmune central nervous system inflammatory conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.05.009,,Blood-brain barrier; Epilepsy; Laser ablation; Laser interstitial therapy; Thermal therapy; Tumors,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although hemianopia severely limits activities of daily life, current clinical practice comprises no training of visual functions in the blind hemifield. To find out whether flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield can be improved with intensive training, and whether training with flicker stimulation can evoke changes in cortical responsiveness. Two men with homonymous hemianopia participated in the experiments. They trained with flicker stimuli at 30 degrees or with flickering letters at 10 degrees eccentricity twice a week for a year, and continued training with more peripheral stimuli thereafter. Neuromagnetic responses were registered at 1-2-month intervals, and the Goldmann perimetry was recorded before, during and after training. Flicker sensitivity in the blind hemifield improved to the level of the intact hemifield within 30 degrees eccentricity in one participant and 20 degrees eccentricity in the other. Flickering letters were recognised equally at 10 degrees eccentricity in the blind and intact hemifields. Improvement spread from the stimulated horizontal meridian to the whole hemianopic field within 30 degrees. Before training, neuromagnetic recordings showed no signal above the noise level in the hemianopic side. During training, evoked fields emerged in both participants. No changes were found in the Goldmann perimetry. Results show that sensitivity to flicker could be fully restored in the stimulated region, that improvement in sensitivity spreads to the surrounding neuronal networks, and that, during training, accompanying changes occurred in the neuromagnetic fields.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.2006.099366,PMC2117780,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The temporal crescent syndrome was ruled out in patients with posterior lesions by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. In some patients with occipital lesions, the subjective and objective visual field results are discordant, and some of them will show a recovery of the visual field deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,American journal of ophthalmology,10.1016/j.ajo.2006.10.042,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
2713142,"On the different roles of the cerebral hemispheres in mental imagery: the ""o'Clock Test"" in two clinical cases.","Grossi, D; Modafferi, A; Pelosi, L; Trojano, L",Grossi,"This paper develops the hypothesis of different roles of the two hemispheres in imaginal processes. A test designated the ""o'Clock Test"" is proposed, which contains closely confrontable perceptual and imaginal tasks. It enables examination of the abilities both to generate mental images and to explore them in their right and left halves (R + L Condition). This test was used to examine two patients, one severely affected by hemi-inattention resulting from a right posterior lesion, and the other with a selective deficit of imagery due to a left occipital lesion. The former demonstrated left neglect in both perceptive and imaginal capacities, while the latter was able to perform correctly only the perceptive tasks. These results suggest that the right hemisphere has functions of organization and spatial exploration at both perceptive and imaginal levels, and that the left hemisphere's role is to generate mental images.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(89)90072-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Hemianopsia with occipital infarction related to carotid artery dissection has therefore rarely been reported. A 40-year-old woman in whom acute-onset hemianopsia developed, related to occipital infarction secondary to internal artery dissection, is described. This atypical association is explained by anatomic variations of the posterior part of the circle of Willis. Neuroimages showed occipital infarction related to internal carotid artery dissection associated with hypoplasia of the proximal portion of the cerebral posterior artery (P1). The anatomic correlation of this atypical association and a review of the literature are presented.",{},,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 20-year-old man visited us with a complaint of left homonymous hemianopia and headache. The patient's visual acuity was 1.2 (n.c.) OD and 0.9 (1.0) OS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass in the temporoparietal lobe. A pathological diagnosis of MS was made by brain biopsy. Low glucose metabolism in the lesion and visual cortex was observed by PET with (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose. PET with (11)C-flumazenyl revealed a reduction of (11)C-uptake in the demyelinated optic radiation, and only a slight reduction of (11)C-uptake in the primary visual cortex. The results of (11)C-flumazenyl PET suggested a slight reduction of neuronal density. In 2 years, the visual field recovered to the normal state.

The patient initially presented a clinical picture of depression as well as frequent gynecological disorders. The author evaluates important aspects of the psychogenesis of the clinical picture and emphasizes the identifying aspects and primary and secondary gains. Consideration is given to the distinct therapeutic strategies used (psychotherapy, autogenous training, hypnosis), and the case is analyzed from a morphodynamic point of view. The author concludes that the organic basis of the clinical picture would be localized in the posterior nuclei of the thalamus.",{},,Archivos de neurobiologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
1641119,"Spatio-motor cueing in unilateral left neglect: the role of hemispace, hand and motor activation.","Robertson, I H; North, N",Robertson,"Reported beneficial effects of left arm activation on neglect are experimentally examined. The present study of a subject with left visual neglect compared left hand finger movement with an instruction to visually anchor perception on the left arm during letter cancellation. Only the finger movements significantly reduced neglect. Another comparison was between ""out of sight"" finger movements of the left hand in left and right hemispace, respectively. Only left hemispace ""blind"" finger movements significantly reduced neglect compared to the standard condition. Thirdly, blind left finger movements in left hemispace were compared with passive visual cueing (reading a changing number) and again it was found that only the finger movements reduced neglect. Finally, right finger movements in left hemispace were compared with left finger movements in left hemispace: only the latter reduced neglect. The implications of these findings for theory and therapy of neglect are discussed.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(92)90058-t,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
18416495,The influence of spatial coordinates in a case of an optic ataxia-like syndrome following cerebellar and thalamic lesion.,"Frassinetti, Francesca; Bonifazi, Silvia; Làdavas, Elisabetta",Frassinetti,"We report the case of a patient (S.C.) who, after a lesion involving the midbrain, thalamus, and cerebellum on the left side, was unable to reach a target at which he was not directly gazing. When attempting to do so with either hand, he showed an optic ataxia-like behaviour: A rightward deviation was manifest with respect to the real position of the target object, accuracy being worse for the right than for the left hand and for the right than for the left hemifield. To assess whether S.C.'s reaching accuracy was affected by the position of the target with respect to the retina, eyes, and/or head, he was asked to perform a pointing task in different conditions. By manipulating eyes and head position, the relative location of the target with respect to these body parts was altered. Further, to verify the relevance of the visual feedback for the accuracy of the reaching responses, the task was also performed either with or without vision of the performing hand (closed- and open-loop conditions). The results showed that the patient's reaching impairment reflects a deficit in spatio-motor coding mainly within head-centred coordinates. The lack of visual feedback about the hand spatial location worsened the reaching performance. This new pattern of reaching deficits is discussed in relation to the theoretical framework of both parietal optic ataxia and cerebellar ataxia.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290701275857,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This rare campimetric deficit involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. A 41-year-old patient presented with a complaint of blurred vision. Visual acuity was 20/20 on both sides. Visual field showed a left quadruple sectoranopia. CT scan, MRI, MRA and conventional angiography showed a right cerebral arteriovenous malformation supplied partly by the right anterior choroidal artery. Partial retinal nerve fiber layer atrophy matched to the campimetric deficit proved that some degree of infarction involved the lateral geniculate body. The arteriovenous malformation was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Two years after treatment, the nidus had completely disappeared. The campimetric deficit began improving from 19 months onwards after stereotactic radiosurgery. Twenty-eight months after treatment, the superior defect had completely reversed. Quadruple sectoranopia involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. Following radio-induced angioma thrombosis, blood was no longer shunted away from the right lateral geniculate body, whose viable areas resumed their activity. Accordingly, a partial campimetric recovery occurred.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,10.1007/s00417-004-0937-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Both cases had pure alexia and right homonymous hemianopsia. Midsagittal inversion recovery (IR) images demonstrated that the corpus callosum was completely intact, and coronal IR images revealed involvement of the lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus, forceps major, inferior longitudinal fascicle, and optic radiation in the dominant cerebral hemisphere in both cases. Midline sagittal images provided direct visualization of the corpus callosum but did not provide sufficient information for the study of callosal disconnection syndromes. Coronal reconstructions aided in visualizing the relationship of lesions to the adjacent structures of cerebral white and gray matter.

The patient, A.L., suffered a right-hemisphere stroke with left hemiplegia; over the 6 months post-stroke, the overall course of his neglect was monitored with the Behavioural Inattention Test at approximately monthly intervals. An experimental investigation of multitrial line bisection was also repeated six times and analysed both between and within sessions. The results confirm previous reports of a linear relationship between transection displacements and line length, and also of anomalous crossover with 'right neglect' at 'shorter' length. Both effects are reliable over time in this patient. The most striking finding, however, was 'recovery' within a session of the extended line bisection task. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of this phenomenon in the context of attentional theories of neglect.",{},,Brain injury,10.3109/02699059108998508,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
30068811,[A case of painful seizure accompanying ictal paresis and homonymous hemianopia due to post-stroke epilepsy].,"Tanaka, Kanta; Hashimoto, Shuji; Harada, Yuzuru; Kageyama, Takashi; Suenaga, Toshihiko",Tanaka,"A 69-year-old female with an old infarct of the left parietotemporal lobe was admitted for the evaluation of suspected painful seizures accompanying ictal paresis. The painful seizure and ictal paresis involved her right extremities without convulsions, although intermittent tremulous movements were noted on the right upper extremity. She also showed right hemianopia during the seizure. Ictal scalp EEG demonstrated lateralized rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity intermingled with a large amount of spikes, sharp waves, and fast activity mainly on the posterior half of the left hemisphere. Ictal MRI showed restricted diffusion in the postcentral gyrus and dilatation of distal branches of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT revealed hyperperfusion on the left parietal cortex. Treatment with antiepileptic drugs successfully prevented seizure recurrence, then she was discharged home. On the follow-up SPECT after 1 month, the abnormal hyperperfusion disappeared. MRI demonstrated resolution of the restricted diffusion and the MCA dilatation. Taken together with the EEG abnormality and the transient abnormalities in SPECT and MRI, we concluded that her seizures were epileptic and that her painful seizures likely arise from the left primary somatosensory cortex. The mechanism of ictal paresis would be attributed to some disturbed functional architecture in the left primary motor cortex leading to loss of normal motor function through epileptic interference by ictal discharges. The same mechanism in the visual cortex could be assumed for her ictal hemianopia. Painful seizure and ictal paresis each is rarely encountered, even more so the combination thereof. These ictal manifestations might be difficult to differentiate from transient ischemic attack or postictal paresis, and thus EEG is essential to diagnose this treatable condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001167,,epileptic negative manifestation; epileptic painful seizure; ictal hemianopia; ictal paresis; lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA),Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
