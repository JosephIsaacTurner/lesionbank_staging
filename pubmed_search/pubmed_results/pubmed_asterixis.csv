He developed disorientation, asterixis, nausea and elevated serum ammonia (221 μmol/L) 48-72 hours after treatment onset with preserved liver function. After ruling out potential causes of encephalopathy and tumor progression by abdominal and brain CT scans, his symptoms were related by exclusion to the recently initiated treatment with capecitabine. Capecitabine discontinuation, onset of standard anti-encephalopathy measures, and intravenous hydration led to a rapid, complete resolution of symptoms with serum ammonia normalization.",{},,Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas,10.17235/reed.2021.8129/2021,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,eng

This study reports the role of manganese in brain alterations and therefore in clinical manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. Male patient, 67 years old, suffering from alcoholic liver cirrhosis and two previous episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, developed drowsiness, asterixis, amnesia, disorientation in time and space, and psychomotor retardation. Brain MRI without contrast showed: initial signs of cerebral atrophy, a hyperintense signal of globi pallidi and bilateral substantia nigra. The hyperintense signal of globi pallidi is the result of manganese deposition in the brain. The case report presented supports the data reported in the literature indicating that the increase in plasma manganese levels in subjects with liver dysfunction is correlated with the onset of extrapyramidal symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Reviews on recent clinical trials,10.2174/1574887117666220617104539,,Hepatic encephalopathy; Manganese; brain; cirrhosis; extrapyramidal symptoms; globi pallidi; liver dysfunction,Case Reports,United Arab Emirates,eng
33480615,Gabapentin-Induced Myokymia: A Case Report.,"Brown, Alexander; Esechie, Aimalohi; Gogia, Bhanu; Shanina, Elena",Brown,"Gabapentin is a commonly used medication for neuropathic pain and epilepsy that is prescribed by a wide range of medical specialties. Adverse effects including asterixis and myoclonus have been described in patients with chronic kidney disease, but myokymia has not been previously reported. A 69-year-old man with a history of traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia, and posttraumatic stress disorder presented to the hospital after multiple falls attributed to acute onset muscle spasms. He reported taking a total daily dose of 9600 mg of gabapentin, as prescribed. Physical examination demonstrated stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, painful muscle spasms in all extremities, and myokymia in his bilateral calves. Diffuse action tremors, as well as tongue tremors, were also observed.Initial workup, including basic laboratory investigations, brain imaging, and electroencephalogram, was unrevealing. Gabapentin toxicity was suspected, and a gabapentin holiday was initiated with the improvement of myokymia by hospital day 3. The patient was found to have a high gabapentin level (25.8 μg/mL; reference range, 2.0-20.0 μg/mL) measured the morning after hospital presentation. After restarting on a lower dose of gabapentin with multimodal pain control, the patient continued to improve with diminution of his myoclonus, tremor, and gait instability. Myokymia is a newly described motor symptom associated with gabapentin toxicity. The mechanism of gabapentin-associated myokymia is currently unknown. A brief medication holiday resulted in the resolution of motor symptoms without significant withdrawal symptoms. Knowledge of this newly reported adverse manifestation can aid physicians in the diagnosis of gabapentin toxicity and prompt treatment, as gabapentin levels are not widely or immediately available.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/WNF.0000000000000434,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

It was the only skeletal motor sign in a patient with ophthalmoplegia caused by midbrain infarction; no metabolic abnormality was present. The asterixis was accompanied by signs of damage to the mesencephalic reticular formation. We propose that episodic lapses of postural control by the reticular formation are responsible for midbrain asterixis and suggest that this asterixis is a segmental form of drop attack.,{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410060411,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

34974486,New-onset Oscillopsia in a Patient With a History of Pontine Stroke.,"Kabanovski, Anna; Donaldson, Laura; Margolin, Edward",Kabanovski,"A 69-year-old man with a history of pontine hemorrhage 2 years ago noticed binocular vertical diplopia after the stroke. On examination, there was a small-angle incomitant left hyperdeviation that did not fit the 3-step test for fourth nerve palsy and incyclotorsion of the higher eye. On motility testing, there was an obvious pendular nystagmus. Resting tremor of the right hand was noticed on neurological examination. Examination of the oropharynx revealed rhythmic oscillations of the soft palate synchronous with the eye oscillations and hand tremor. These findings established a diagnosis of oculopalatal myoclonus (OPM). Although OPM is a well-described entity, this case is unique because the patient was completely asymptomatic from OPM and did not complain of oscillopsia but was very bothered by vertical diplopia because of skew deviation. It also demonstrates that OPM may coexist with skew deviation because anatomically vestibulo-ocular pathway is close to the triangle of Guillain-Mollaret and patients with lesions in one pathway should be examined for abnormalities in the other. Finally, it reminds us about the importance of monitoring patients with a history of brainstem insults for emergence of synchronous tremors years later and that simple maneuver-like ex/amining oropharynx may provide a clear diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,10.1097/WNO.0000000000001461,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

She was apathetic and had left leg paresis and asterixis in all extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute cerebral infarctions in the bilateral frontal lobes perfused by the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Anticoagulant treatments improved ischemia-induced damage of the frontal lobes, and then her neurological symptoms including asterixis gradually disappeared. A unique point of this case is that acute stroke in the bilateral ACA territory induced bilateral asterixis resembling metabolic encephalopathy.

We report a novel case of asterixis in the leg after unilateral anterior cerebral artery territory infarction. A 76-year-old man was admitted with sudden-onset mild right leg weakness and postural instability due to knee buckling. He was diagnosed with ischemic stroke in the left prefrontal area and cingulated gyrus by brain magnetic imaging. Needle electromyography of the right vastus lateralis muscle while standing showed intermittent periods of EMG silence, consistent with asterixis. There were no abnormal involuntary movements in the upper extremities. This case suggests that gait disturbance or postural instability after structural lesions in the prefrontal area may be directly related to asterixis in the leg, not in the arm associated with postural failure.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-016-2486-0,,Anterior cerebral artery territory infarction; Asterixis; Movement disorder; Prefrontal,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
24332366,A neurologist's approach to delirium: diagnosis and management of toxic metabolic encephalopathies.,"Krishnan, Vaishnav; Leung, Lester Y; Caplan, Louis R",Krishnan,"Toxic metabolic encephalopathies (TMEs) present as an acute derangement in consciousness, cognition and behavior, and can be brought about by various triggers, including endocrine and metabolic disturbances, exogenous toxins, pain and infection. Also referred to as ""delirium"" or ""acute confusional states,"" TMEs are characterized by (1) an altered level of consciousness and activity, (2) global changes in cognition with inattention, (3) a fluctuating course with disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, and (4) asterixis and myoclonus. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is poorly understood. Imbalanced neurotransmitter signaling and pathologically heightened brain inflammatory cytokine signaling have been proposed as candidate mechanisms. Focal brain lesions can also occasionally mimic TMEs. A neurological examination is required to identify the presence of focal findings, which when present, identify a new focal lesion or the recrudescence of prior ischemic, inflammatory or neoplastic insults. Diagnostic testing must include a search for metabolic and infectious derangements. Offending medications should be withdrawn. Magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroencephalography should be considered in select clinical situations. In addition to being an unpleasant experience for the patient and family, this condition is associated with extended hospital stays, increased mortality and high costs. In individuals with diminished cognitive reserve, episodes of TME lead to an accelerated decline in cognitive functioning. Starting with an illustrative case, this paper provides a neurologist's approach to the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and management of toxic metabolic encephalopathies.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,European journal of internal medicine,10.1016/j.ejim.2013.11.010,,Confusion; Confusional state; Delirium; Encephalopathy; Metabolic encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng
28961956,Tremor Secondary to a Thalamic Glioma: A Case Report.,"Wang, Tony R; Fadul, Camilo E; Elias, W Jeff",Wang,"Tremor is the most prevalent movement disorder. While the exact pathophysiology remains to be elucidated, the importance of the thalamus in tremor circuitry is well recognized. Thalamic lesions from demyelination, trauma, ischemia, or neoplasm rarely cause isolated tremor. We report the case of a patient presenting with a tremor secondary to a thalamic grade II astrocytoma that improved with treatment. A 50-yr-old male presented with a 1-yr history of right-hand tremor. The presence of long tract signs prompted imaging that revealed a lesion within the left thalamus. Stereotactic biopsy revealed a World Health Organization grade II astrocytoma. Prior to biopsy, the patient's tremor was graded using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Immediately postoperatively the patient remained at his neurological baseline without improvement in his tremor. Subsequent fractionated radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide led to radiographic response as well as clinical improvement. The patient reported less tremor, which was confirmed objectively with improved Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores at 6 and 12 mo postoperatively. This case of a thalamic glioma presenting with isolated contralateral tremor highlights the role of the thalamus in the development of tremor. Moreover, this particular case contrasts with other published reports on the lack of additional symptoms and tremor response to chemoradiation.",{},,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",10.1093/ons/opx181,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This study aims at elucidating the pathophysiology of the thalamic asterixis. Two cases with unilateral asterixis caused by an infarction in the lateral thalamus were studied by analysing the asterixis-related cortical activities, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for motor cortex excitability and probabilistic diffusion tractography for the thalamo-cortical connectivity. Averaging of electroencephalogram (EEG) time-locked to the asterixis revealed rhythmic oscillations of a beta band at the central area contralateral to the affected hand. TMS revealed a decrease in the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and a prolongation of the silent period (SP). The anatomical mapping of connections between the thalamus and cortical areas using a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) showed that the lateral thalamus involved by the infarction was connected to the premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the corresponding hemisphere. The thalamic asterixis is mediated by the sensorimotor cortex, which is subjected to excessive inhibition as a result of the thalamic lesion involving the ventral lateral nucleus. This is the first demonstration of participation of the sensorimotor cortex in the generation of asterixis due to the lateral thalamic lesion.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1016/j.clinph.2012.01.021,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Although experimental animal models of MIE have suggested a Wernicke's encephalopathy-like pathology, little is known about the histopathological features of MIE. Here we report the first autopsy case of irreversible MIE. A 72-year-old Japanese woman with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour and metastatic tumours in the liver developed intraabdominal bleeding from a hepatic abscess. She was administered metronidazole for 79 days (1.5 g/day), which caused dysarthria followed by hand tremor and altered mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging at the time of onset revealed hyperintensities in the deep white matter of the bilateral parietal lobes and splenium of the corpus callosum on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Despite the improvement of dysarthria and hand tremor, her cognition remained affected even after the withdrawal of metronidazole. She died of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour at the age of 74 years. Histopathological examinations of the brain confirmed a combination of severe demyelination and moderate axonal degeneration, which corresponded to the regions showing abnormal signal intensities on DWI with reduced ADC values. There were no pathological findings suggestive of Wernicke's encephalopathy in the brain. We have demonstrated the clinical, radiographic and histopathological aspects of irreversible MIE. Hyperintensities on DWI with reduced ADC values in affected regions may indicate a poor clinical prognosis due to irreversible pathological damage.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-03006-4,PMC9753291,Apparent diffusion coefficient; Case report; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, an asterixis occasionally resembles a transient ischemic attack (TIA). On the other hand, reports have indicated that anemia is an independent risk factor for brain ischemia. Therefore, both asterixis and anemia are important considerations for stroke diagnosis. A 79-year-old man with frequent leg palsy was initially diagnosed with recurrent TIA at the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) with a tiny callosal infarction and aspirin was prescribed immediately. However, subsequent careful physical examination revealed asterixis at both the wrist and knee joints. Laboratory testing and colonoscopy revealed severe anemia secondary to colon cancer. Blood transfusion immediately improved the asterixis and gait, thus confirming that anemia contributed to the patient's symptoms.

A 74-yr-old male with medically refractory ET, and a right-sided ventricular shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus, underwent FUS to the right ventro-intermedius (VIM) nucleus. The VIM nucleus was directly targeted using deterministic tractography. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor. Shunt components required 6% of the total ultrasound transducer elements to be shut off. Eight therapeutic sonications were delivered (maximum temperature, 64°), leading to a 90% improvement in hand tremor and a 100% improvement in functional disability at the 3-mo follow-up. No complications were noted. This is the first case of FUS thalamotomy in a patient with a shunt.

Therefore, when treatment for hand tremors begins, various pharmacological options have to be considered. In clinical practice, a practical approach is to initially check hand tremor patients for signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), because patients with PD can benefit from dopamine treatment. However, only part of patients with PD tends to show a meaningful improvement in hand tremors for dopamine treatment. On the other hand, dopamine treatment may help with hand tremors of patients with other disorders, but dopamine responsiveness can't be predicted by clinical assessment alone. Hand tremors.

7224601,Asterixis and encephalopathy following metrizamide myelography: investigations into possible mechanisms and review of the literature.,"Bertoni, J M; Schwartzman, R J; Van Horn, G; Partin, J",Bertoni,"Marked asterixis occurred in two patients following metrizamide myelography. One also suffered generalized seizures and the other had severe stuttering speech for seven days. The spectrum of toxic manifestations of metrizamide is reviewed with emphasis on the unusual lethargy and other depressive effects seen with this relatively safe agent. The hypothesis that metrizamide exerts a ouabain-like effect on the cortical surface was tested. Metrizamide in concentrations as high as 20 mM had no inhibitory effect on rat cerebral K+-para-nitrophenylphosphatase, a partial reaction of (Na+K+)-adenosine triphosphatase. Because metrizamide is a 2-deoxyglucose analogue, a competitive inhibition of hexokinase at the first step in glycolysis was also postulated. Metrizamide was found to competitively inhibit commercial (microbial) hexokinase. The Michaelis constant for glucose rises from 0.13 to 0.25 to 0.33 to 0.91 mM in the presence of 0, 0.4, 1.0, and 2.0 mM metrizamide, respectively. Since the concentration of metrizamide over the cerebral cortex after routine myelography may be approximately 50 mM compared with a glucose concentration of only 3.6 mM (65 mg/dl), it is postulated that impaired brain glucose metabolism may be responsible for some of the toxic effects of metrizamide.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410090409,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

He had had a psychosomatically underdeveloped childhood, with a propensity for legumes without a family history of the same or a record of consanguinity. On admission, he had disturbed consciousness and emaciation without other physical abnormalities. The EEG revealed diffuse slow waves with occasional appearance of triphasic waves. A high level of serum citrulline (534.7 nmol/ml) was recognized and the assay of urea cycle enzymes in the liver demonstrated decreased argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) activity (0.062 U/g liver, 7.4% of that in normal liver), although no kinetic abnormality was found. Accordingly he was diagnosed as having type II citrullinemia. In addition, this case could be classified as cluster type of localization of the ASS in the liver by immunohistochemical study. There were characteristic findings concerning his clinical picture and laboratory data, such as a significant correlation between the grade of disturbed consciousness and arterial blood gas pH (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01). However, the blood ammonia level did not always correlate with the severity of disturbed consciousness. Oral treatment with sodium citrate and sodium benzoate was very effective, though transiently, for disturbed consciousness in this case. Pathological findings of the autopsied liver were fatty change and fibrosis. Neuropathologically, characteristic findings were brain edema with cerebellar tonsilar herniation, laminar necrosis with spongy formation in cerebral cortex, and Alzheimer type II glia.

As to our knowledge, there is no published paper relating delusional disorder, paranoid type (DD-PT) and UIA, which can have important clinical implication. We describe a case of a woman who had DD-PT and UIA. The patient in her fifties, a typist with elementary school education, presented to the psychiatrist with the symptoms of irritability, insomnia, suspiciousness and paranoid ideas lasting for about a year. She showed clear symptoms of a delusional disorder. The psychiatrist established the diagnosis of DD-PT according to ICD-10. Olanzapine therapy, 10 mg day, was introduced immediately, causing partial improvement. In further diagnostic procedure, psychological tests were performed. The finding confirmed the diagnosis and average intellectual efficacy. The additional findings of impaired verbal fluency (VF) and hand tremor signalized an organic origin. The patient was referred to a neurologist, who assessed hand tremor, but otherwise the finding was normal. Brain CT revealed the possible UIA. Neurological hospitalization was quickly organized, and the definitive diagnosis of basilar artery aneurysm of 22 mm in diameter was made by angiography. Several days later, osteoplastic supraorbital craniotomy was performed at the neurosurgical department, with right sided keyhole approach in microsurgical technique, and the aneurysmal neck was clipped. The postoperative course was accompanied by meningitis treated with antibiotics. In neurological status, cerebellar symptomatology, tremor of the left hand, mild hemiparesis on the left side and the right eyelid ptosis persisted. Paranoid delusions were absent, but depressive symptoms emerged. Eight months after the surgery (approx. 11 months after the first test), control psychological testing was performed. The finding showed depression with significant perceptive disorganization. The VF result was within the normal limits. The patient is still being continuously followed-up. During preliminary diagnostic work-up, the possible organic cause and/or relation was suspected, based only on the psychiatric assessment and psychological report, because neurological status was free from any abnormalities other than tremor of the hands. The reported case confirmed the importance of detailed psychiatric interview and psychological testing in persons with psychic disorders, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and therapy.

Given that higher HE grades correlate with poorer outcomes, clinical management of ALF necessitates close neurological monitoring. The primary objective of this case report is to highlight the diagnostic value of utilizing multimodal neuromonitoring (MNM) in a patient suffering from ALF. A 56-year-old male patient with a history of chronic alcoholism, without prior chronic liver disease, and recent acetaminophen use was admitted to the hospital due to fatigue and presenting with a mild flapping tremor. The primary hypothesis was an acute hepatic injury caused by acetaminophen intoxication. In the following hours, the patient's condition deteriorated, accompanied by neurological decline and rising ammonia levels. The patient's neurological status was closely monitored using MNM. Bilaterally altered pupillary light reflex assessed by decreasing in the Neurological Pupil Index values, using automated pupillometry, initially suggested severe brain oedema. However, ultrasound measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter showed normal values in both eyes, P2/P1 noninvasive intracranial pressure waveform assessment was within normal ranges and the cerebral computed tomography-scan revealed no signs of cerebral swelling. Increased middle cerebral artery velocities measured by Transcranial Doppler and the initiation of electroencephalography monitoring yielded the presence of status epilepticus. The utilization of MNM facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the patient's clinical deterioration in the setting of HE. Nonetheless, future studies are needed to show feasibility and to yield valuable insights that can enhance the outcomes for patients with HE using such an approach. Given the absence of specific guidelines in this particular context, it is advisable for physicians to give further consideration to the incorporation of MNM in the management of unconscious patients with ALF.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1097/MS9.0000000000001519,PMC10783349,EEG; acute liver failure; cerebral ultrasound; pupillometry,Case Reports,England,eng

SEPs were normal. MRI disclosed a right cortical infarct within the primary motor cortex in both cases. These findings indicate that asterixis was not related to a failure in the processing of proprioceptive input controlling the regulation of postural tone of the distal upper limbs because SEPs were normal.

Two months later, parietal responses were normal but right frontal SEPs P22 and N30 remained abolished while ataxia of left upper limb persisted. Electromyographic activity recorded at the same time showed periodic involvement of the left hand distal tonus. These finding suggested that both ataxia and asterixis were due to a single postcentral infarct. Frontal SEP components are known to convey proprioceptive inputs which could be received by neocerebellar afferent pathways. Generators of these components are presumably located in premotor cortex and can be activated through parietofrontal connections. In our case it can be assumed that the parietal infarct involved these connections, which are mainly implied in the regulation of postural tonus of the distal upper limbs, and simultaneously impaired neocerebellar afferent pathways resulting in the emergence of parietal ataxia.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

13679721,[An ischemic syndrome of the oculumotor nucleus: associated clinical and anatomical variations on a theme].,"Bonnaud, I; Salama, J",Bonnaud,"Nuclear syndrome of the oculomotor nerve was first described in 1981, it is characterized by the association of an ipsilateral third nerve palsy with a paresis of elevation in the contralateral eye. This syndrome can be caused by vascular or tumoral lesions in the upper midbrain. It is rarely due to ischemic unilateral mesencephalic lesions, because ischemic lesions of the midbrain are usually integrated in a diffuse involvement of the brainstem and the thalamo-sub-thalamic region. In case of nuclear syndrome of the third nerve due to isolated upper midbrain infarct in the paramedian territory, dependent on branches of the basilar artery, oculomotor symptoms are frequently isolated. On the contrary, in fascicular syndromes of the third nerve, resulting from stroke in more lateral territories upon branches of the posterior cerebral artery, many neurological symptoms are associated with the oculomotor signs. We describe 3 patients presenting with a characteristic nuclear syndrome of the third nerve, resulting from a unilateral paramedian ischemic stroke in the upper midbrain, confirmed by cerebral CT scan or MRI examination. Clinical presentation differed in each case, and marked contralateral hemiparesia, cerebellar syndrome and focal asterixis were associated in various ways with the stereotyped oculomotor disorders. In the 3 cases, the nuclear syndrome of the third nerve was associated with fascicular involvement of the nerve, in an unusual clinical picture. The theoretical distinction between nuclear and fascicular syndromes is supported by the anatomical description of the arterial segmentation in the upper midbrain, which remains debated since the first description. According to the variability of clinical presentations, it seems that the arterial territories may be more variable than initially described. Therefore, ischemic lesions of the upper midbrain may involve some vascular borderzones with a high inter-individual variability. Upper midbrain strokes may thus lead to variable clinical pictures.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

Because CAPD provides a poorer ACV clearance than hemodialysis, CAPD patients tend to have a higher risk of developing ACV encephalopathy and to recover more slowly. If CAPD patients develop ACV encephalopathy, a temporary change in the type of dialysis to hemodialysis should be considered.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001355,,acyclovir; acyclovir encephalopathy; herpes zoster; peritoneal dialysis; renal failure,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
30407335,Lithium intoxication presenting as altered consciousness and arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock: A case report.,"Chien, Shun-Ching; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Wu, Yen-Hung",Chien,"Lithium has been used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, with a therapeutic level between 0.6 and 1.5 mEq/L. The possible complications of lithium overdose include altered mental status, hand tremor, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizure, syncope, and arrhythmia. Lithium intoxication can be fatal and is difficult to diagnose in patients without a history of lithium intake. The occurrence of serious cardiac arrhythmias is rare in lithium intoxication. An 81-year-old man was brought to the emergency department because of consciousness disturbance for 2 days. According to his daughter, he had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Recently, his family also observed slurring of speech and easy choking. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Blood examination only revealed impaired renal function. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block. Chest radiography revealed mediastinal widening. The blood pressures obtained from the 4 limbs showed no significant differences. Subsequently, brain computed tomography revealed no obvious intracranial lesion. A neurologist was consulted, and a recent ischemic stroke could not be ruled out. While in the observation area, his systolic blood pressure decreased to <90 mm Hg and he showed bradycardia, and 12-lead electrocardiography revealed an AV block and long pulse. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed no evidence of aortic dissection. Another family member reported a history of lithium intake for bipolar disorder for >30 years. Blood examination revealed a lithium concentration of 2.65 mEq/L. A nephrologist was consulted, and emergency hemodialysis was indicated. Dopamine was administered for his shock status via a right neck central venous catheter. His lithium level gradually declined after the hemodialysis, and blood pressure and consciousness level improved subsequently. The patient was discharged 9 days later in a stable condition. If an emergency physician encounters a patient with altered consciousness and arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock, the patient's drug intake history should be carefully reviewed to rule out cardiovascular problems on the basis of the patient's clinical condition.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000013129,PMC6250446,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neurologic examination failed to show asterixis in both patients. The literature on nonmetabolic causes of TW was also reviewed, and the clinical and anatomic reports of 10 patients have been analyzed: 7 patients had focal brainstem-diencephalic lesions (craniopharyngioma: 2 patients; thalamic gliomas: 3 patients; pontine stroke: 2 patients), and 3 patients suffered from diffuse subcortical or multifocal encephalopathies (Binswanger's encephalopathy: 1 patient; cerebral carcinomatosis: 1 patient; multifocal cerebral lymphoma: 1 patient). From the clinical point of view, patients with nonmetabolic diseases causing TW presented either disturbance of higher cerebral functions with no asterixis or sudden onset of coma. It is concluded that TW may result from focal brainstem/diencephalic lesions or from diffuse subcortical or multifocal encephalopathies in the absence of concomitant metabolic abnormalities.

We report the first case presenting an association of the three adverse effects occurring with divalproate sodium prescribed for bipolar disorder: a 58-year-old man with a history of bipolar type I disorder presented with Parkinsonian syndrome and cognitive impairment of insidious onset. This patient had been treated for several years with lithium carbonate, with a successful effect on mood swings, but with distressing adverse effects such as hand tremor and diarrhoea. Lithium therapy was progressively withdrawn while sodium divalproate was initiated. Associated medications, unchanged for several years, were amisulpride (daily dose: 100 mg), liothyronine, ciprofibrate and benfluorex. The patient was treated with sodium divalproate for seven months (daily dose: 1,000 mg), and with trihexyphenidyle for one month for extrapyramidal symptoms. At hospital admission, he presented with temporal disorientation, slowed thinking, severe anterograde memory deficits, and Parkinsonian syndrome. The minimal mental state (MMS) score was 16 (maximum: 30). The patient was anxious but did no present with mood symptoms. He also developed hyperammonemia (124 micromol/liter, normal range: 15 to 60 micromol/liter) without signs or biochemical evidence of hepatic failure. Valproate concentrations were within the therapeutic ranges (79 mg/l, normal range: 50 to 100 mg/l). The CT-scan showed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with enlarged ventricles. The electroencephalogram showed generalized slowing waves. All the symptoms resolved within one month after the withdrawal of divalproate: the extrapyramidal hypertonia resolved, the MMS score was 29. The CT-scan and the electroencephalogram returned to normal. The divalproate was replaced by lithium. After a one-year follow-up, the cognitive and neurological symptomatology did not reappear at the exception of the pre-existing hand tremor. The pathophysiology of valproate induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy remains unclear. A possible mechanism is neuronal toxicity induced by increased intracellular concentrations of glutamate and ammonium in astrocytes. Indeed, these abnormal intracellular concentrations increase the intracellular osmolarity and thus induce rise in intracranial pressure and cerebral oedema. Reversible dementia could be due to a direct toxic effect of valproate on the central nervous system or to an indirect effect mediated through valproate-induced hyperammonemia. It has been suggested that the occurrence of extrapyramidal syndrome could be explained by a disturbance in the GABAergic pathways inducing reversible dopamine inhibition. A drug adverse reaction should always be considered when a patient treated with valproate presents with extrapyramidal symptoms and cognitive disorders even when valproate concentrations are within standard therapeutic ranges.",{},,L'Encephale,10.1016/s0013-7006(05)82378-4,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

However, fungal masses called cryptococcoma can sometimes be formed. We report a case in which intraventricular cryptococcoma in an immunocompetent patient was completely cured using liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) and voriconazole (VRCZ). A 56-year-old previously healthy man was admitted to our hospital with fever, headache and bilateral hand tremor lasting over three weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies on admission showed meningitis with a white blood cell count of 228 cells/μL: mononuclear leukocytes, 96%; polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 4%; proteins, 157 mg/dL; and glucose, 50 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a small, homogeneously enhanced lesion in the right lateral ventricle, and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 11C-methionine positron emission tomography revealed abnormal uptake corresponding to the lesion. To reach a definitive diagnosis, surgical excision of the lesion was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen showed moderate lymphocyte infiltration and numerous fungal spores, and periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott staining revealed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans (C.neoformans) within the granuloma, leading to a diagnosis of CNS cryptococcoma. The patient underwent treatment with intravenous L-AMB for 2 weeks and oral VRCZ for 10 months. CSF cultures were negative for C.neoformans and no recurrences were identified on MRI. CNS cryptococcoma is a rare infection that may occur in patients with no known history of immunosuppression. This pathology can be difficult to distinguish from brain tumor, so early pathological diagnosis from an excised specimen is very important. Furthermore, administration of L-AMB and VRCZ may be effective in treating cases of CNS cryptococcoma.",{},,No shinkei geka.

They were clipped completely without any troubles during surgery. But postoperative CT scan demonstrated contralateral cerebellar infarction. We recognized left-hand tremor as a neurological deficit caused by cerebellar infarction in case 1. Concerning the mechanism of contralateral cerebellar infarction after pterional craniotomy, we think that it could be; --1) changing of venous blood flow by overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid, 2) destruction of the bridging vein because of cerebral transformation with rapid decompression, 3) ischemia caused by brain retraction and compression during operation, 4) hypertension or hypoxia during operation, 5) crossed cerebellar diaschosis, and so on. In our 2 cases, we believe that perioperative CSF overdrainage caused the contralateral cerebellar infarction or CCD. To avoid this kind of infarction, we should try to take more protective and careful procedures as well as closer perioperative management.",{},,No shinkei geka.

It occurs during posture maintenance. It is usually bilateral and, in this case, is observed in metabolic encephalopathy. Unilateral asterixis is more uncommon. We report 12 cases which occurred in patients with focal brain lesions. In all cases asterixis involved the upper limb and the lower limb in only 2 cases. Asterixis was transient, discrete and always associated with other neurological signs. The causal lesions (7 infracts, 2 haematomas, 2 abscesses, 1 meningioma) were unique in 7 cases and multiple in 5. Asterixis was always contralateral to the unilateral lesions. Lesions mainly involved the thalamus (7 cases) and other structures (lenticular nucleus, frontal lobe, internal capsule, precentral regions and cerebellum).

15131742,[Asterixis in focal brain lesions].,"Velasco, F; Gomez, J C; Zarranz, J J; Lambarri, I; Ugalde, J",Velasco,"Asterixis is a motor control disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal movements of the lower limbs in the vertical plane during posture maintenance. Asterixis is usually bilateral and associated with toxic-metabolic metabolic encephalopathies. Unilateral asterixis is less frequent and it normally indicates focal brain damage. We report the cases of four patients (two males/two females), aged 57 to 83 years, suffering from uni or bilateral asterixis associated with focal brain damage. All patients underwent CT brain scan and a neurophysiological study (parietal EMG and/or PES). In addition, any toxic-metabolic cause that could be produced by this clinical phenomenon was ruled out with the appropriate testing. Unilateral asterixis is a clinical symptom that may indicate the presence of focal brain damage. Often, it is ignored or overlooked during routine neurological examinations. On the other hand, the presence of a bilateral asterixis is not always indicative of a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.Rarely, such as in one of the cases herein presented, bilateral asterixis can also appear associated with structural brain lesions. Although asterixis diagnosis is fundamentally clinical, the neurophysiological study contributes to verify the diagnosis.",{},,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,spa

She noted a difficulty in holding a glass and hand tremor in June of 1996 when she was 63 years old. In July of 1996, she tended to lean toward left when she walked. She also noted truncal titubation. In November of 1996, she started to have visual hallucination and delusion in which she said ""I see something is flying on the wall."", ""Somebody has come into my room"", and things like that. She was admitted to our service on November 22, 1996. On admission, she was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurologic examination revealed disturbance in recent memory. Hasegawa's dementia rating scale was 22/30. She showed vivid visual hallucination with colors in which she saw faces of dwarfs and angels, a space ship, and others. Higher cerebral functions were normal. She showed left oculomotor palsy which was a sequel of an aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage nine years before. Otherwise cranial nerves were unremarkable. She showed ataxic gait, limb ataxia, truncal titubation, and postural hand tremor. She had no weakness and no muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits. Plantar response was flexor. Sensation was intact. Laboratory examination was also unremarkable. Complete survey for occult malignancy was negative. CSF was under a normal pressure and cell count was 1/microliter, total protein 27 mg/dl, and sugar 68 mg/dl. Cranial CT scan was unremarkable. MRI was not obtained because of the presence of an aneurysm clip in the left internal carotid-posterior communication artery junction. She showed progressive deterioration in her mental function. By January 1997, she became unable to stand or walk with marked dementia. Repeated CSF exams and cranial CT scans were unremarkable. She suffered from several episodes of aspiration pneumonia. A trial of three days methylprednisolone pulse therapy was given starting on March 7, 1997, which was of no effect on her neurologic status. On March 28, 1997, she was intubated because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In April 2, her body temperature rose to 38 degrees C. On April 9, 1997, her blood pressure dropped and resuscitation was unsuccessful. She was pronounced dead on the same day. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had primary leptomeningeal lymphoma. Other possibilities entertained among the audience included brain stem encephalitis of unknown type, carcinomatous cerebellar degeneration plus limbic encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, thalamic degeneration, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Post-mortem examination revealed thickening and clouding of the leptomeninges; Gram-positive diplococci were found in the leptomeninges. This meningitis appeared to have been an complication in the terminal stage of her illness. Microscopic examination revealed astrocytosis in the midbrain tegmentum. Cerebral cortices showed only mild astrtocytosis. No cerebellar atrophy was seen and Purkinje cells were retained which excluded paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Neuropathologic diagnosis was bacterial meningitis, however, the presence of brain stem encephalitis prior to the onset of bacterial meningitis could not be excluded. It is interesting to note that the diagnosis of the primary neurologic disease of this patient was not easy even after autopsy. As autopsy permission was obtained only for the brain, it was not clear whether or not this patient had an occult malignancy somewhere in her body, however, there was no evidence to indicate paraneoplastic degeneration of the central nervous system. As the patient did not have meningeal signs until one month before her death, it is difficult to ascribe her entire neurologic problems to her meningitis.
