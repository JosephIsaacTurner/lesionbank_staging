32624028,Neuroimages and Neuropathology of a Stroke-Like Cerebral Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis.,"Marano, Massimo; Brunelli, Chiara; De Marco, Costanza; Martini, Maurizio; Quattrocchi, Carlo Cosimo; Lauriola, Libero; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Marano,"A 70-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department reporting the acute onset of non-fluent aphasia, hyposthenia, and hemi-anesthesia of the right body. Brain computerized tomography revealed a subcortical hypodense lesion in the middle cerebral artery territory. Neck ultrasounds of internal and external carotid arteries and of the vertebral arteries showed a focal moderate stenosis of the left internal carotid artery due to a soft atheromasic plaque. These findings that were initially consistent with a diagnosis of an ischemic stroke were not confirmed by magnetic resonance (MR). The latter showed an hyperintense lesion on FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences located in the left centrum semiovale, corona radiata, and thalamus, with a well-defined regular rim and a mild compressive effect on the lateral ventricle, with diffusivity restriction but without ADC reduction and with a punctate and serpiginous gadolinium enhancement on T1 sequences (Figure 1). Within the first day of observation, the patient started complaining progressive mental deterioration, in absence of any other possible causes, and a total body CT scan excluded any other organ involvement. Patient was then referred to the neurosurgeon in order to perform a brain biopsy. The neuropathology was compatible with the diagnosis of cerebral lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) (Figure 1).","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

35027230,'Cortical Hand' in the Emergency Department: Two Case Reports.,"Davies, Matthew L; Harrison, Mark",Davies,"Cortical hand strokes affect the 'hand knob' of the motor cortex, resulting in isolated distal upper limb or hand weakness. They are rare and can be easily misdiagnosed for peripheral lesions. Case 1: A 59-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after noticing left hand weakness while driving. There was no sensory deficit noted. A full neurological examination suggested an upper motor neurone rather than a peripheral nerve lesion. This was confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging scan of his brain. Case 2: An 88-year-old man presented to the ED after developing sudden-onset left hand weakness while completing a newspaper puzzle. Power returned gradually over approximately 4 h, with no sensory symptoms being noted. A transient ischemic attack leading to cortical hand was diagnosed. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Cortical hand strokes are a rare, but important, differential for wrist drop. They are often first strokes and embolic in nature. Therefore, correct diagnosis is vital to enable initiation of secondary prevention.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.10.010,,cortical hand; stroke; wrist drop,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
33728181,Ischemic Stroke After Tumor Resection in a Patient With Glioblastoma Multiforme.,"Soliman, Sara; Ghaly, Medhat",Soliman,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GM) is the most common type of aggressive malignant glioma in the brain or spinal cord and represents 15% of all primary brain tumors among adults. Although ischemic strokes in the setting of an underlying glioma is a rare occurrence, its diagnosis is usually challenging due to the overlapping neurological manifestations with the underlying brain tumor. We report a case of a 58-year-old white male who presented with subacute worsening symptoms of expressive aphasia with focal neurological symptoms, including right-sided extremity motor weakness and intermittent vision spots. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed a large 9.5 cm infiltrating mass in the left frontal and temporal lobes, strongly indicative of a primary glioma. The patient underwent resection to confirm diagnosis and remove part of the tumor mass. Pathological examination revealed GM. Expressive aphasia was markedly improved following the surgery; however, on postoperative day 3, the patient developed acute onset of right-sided weakness and sensory deficit. MRI revealed acute left posterior, frontal, and parietal infarct. Unfortunately, recent brain surgery would not allow for intravenous thrombolysis, and, therefore, he was discharged with a plan for outpatient radiation treatment and oral temozolomide chemotherapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.13232,PMC7948307,glioblastoma multiforme; glioma; hemorrhagic stroke; thrombolysis,Case Reports,United States,eng
36034172,A Case Report of Herpes Zoster-Associated Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis.,"Li, Man; Wang, Xingyu; Chen, Mojun; Chang, Yuan; Li, Linfeng; Zhong, Shan",Li,"Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) is a rare demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is caused by a direct viral infection or secondary autoimmune responses. BBE secondary to Herpes zoster has rarely been reported. A 68-year-old man developed a painful vesicular rash and drooping eyelid on the left side of his face for 20 days. Physical examination revealed left-sided blepharoptosis and crusted erythema on the left front side of his face, left upper eyelid, and left nasal tip. Neurological examination showed impaired sensation over the left side of his face and cheek. His left pupil was dilated (4mm compared to 2mm on the right side), and the Pupillary light reflection (PLR) was absent, with an ocular movement disorder (limited adduction) and diplopia. Brain imaging did not reveal abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed leukocytosis and increased protein levels. He was treated with intravenous acyclovir for 7 days, but developed disturbance of consciousness and right limb weakness. Neurological examination revealed right lower limb hypoesthesia. The Heel-Knee-Shin test was positive on the left side, and Babinski's sign was present on the right side. He was diagnosed with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis caused by herpes zoster. After 2 days of intravenous acyclovir combined with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), the patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Then, his treatment was changed to systemic steroids. At the 3-month follow-up, his pupils were bilaterally equal and reactive to light, and there was a significant improvement in ocular motility and ptosis. At the 6-month follow-up, his diplopia had completely resolved. BBE associated with herpes zoster is very rare and can be overlooked. Dermatologists should be aware of the expanding spectrum of neurological complications caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections to aid early diagnosis and treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Infection and drug resistance,10.2147/IDR.S374981,PMC9417297,Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis; acute kidney injury; herpes zoster; treatment,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng
2039391,Opercular cheiro-oral syndrome.,"Bogousslavsky, J; Dizerens, K; Regli, F; Despland, P A",Bogousslavsky,"Perioral and distal upper limb sensory dysfunction (cheiro-oral syndrome) has classically been attributed to cortical involvement. In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1991.00530180116027,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, dermatomal temperature and pain sensory loss have rarely been reported in patients with LMI. We describe the case of a patient with LMI presenting solely with temperature and pain sensory disorder below the C5 sensory level. Magnetic resonance imaging findings demonstrated a small superficial infarction in the right lateral medulla oblongata, indicating that the sensory deficit was caused by a restricted infarction of the lateral spinothalamic tract. We emphasize the importance of adding LMI to a differential diagnosis of acute dermatomal sensory disturbance without other major symptoms of LMI, such as cranial nerve abnormalities, ataxia and Horner's syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Oxford medical case reports,10.1093/omcr/omac147,PMC9853935,,Case Reports,England,eng

In deciding treatment strategies, it is helpful to classify cavernous malformation according to its origin, as follows: in the Gasserian ganglion (Type G); between the cisternal and intra-axial portions of the trigeminal nerve root (Type C); in the intra-axial trigeminal nerve root in the pons (Type P); or in the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve root (Type S). A 62-year-old male presented with left trigeminal neuralgia (V2 area) and left facial hypoesthesia. Imaging studies revealed a cerebellopontine angle mass lesion with characteristics of a cavernous malformation and evidence of hemorrhage. The lesion was completely removed via a left anterior transpetrosal approach. The mass was attached to the trigeminal nerve root; it was located between the cisternal and intra-axial portions of the nerve root, and feeding off microvessels from the trigeminal nerve vascular plexus. Histological examination confirmed a cavernous malformation. In this case, the cavernous malformation was Type C.

This induces 2 pathways with immunothrombosis from activated endothelium (cytokine storm, leukocyte and platelet recruitment, and activation of coagulation extrinsic pathway), and rise of angiotensin II levels promoting inflammation. While thrombosis is widely described in COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit, cerebrovascular diseases remains rare, in particular cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We describe 2 cases of women admitted during the spring of 2020 for intracranial hypertension signs, in stroke units in Great-east, a French area particularly affected by COVID-19 pandemia. Cerebral imaging revealed extended CVT in both cases. The first case described was more serious due to right supratentorial venous infarction with hemorrhagic transformation leading to herniation. Both patients presented typical pneumonia due to SARS-Cov-2 infection, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab in only one. The first patient had to undergo decompressive craniectomy, and both patients were treated with anticoagulation therapy. Favorable outcome was observed for 1 patient. Persistent coma, due to bi thalamic infarction, remained for the other with more serious presentation. CVT, as a serious complication of COVID-19, has to be searched in all patients with intracranial hypertension syndrome. Data about anticoagulation therapy to prevent such serious thrombosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection are lacking, in particular in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000024708,PMC7969213,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
29101073,Malignant Cerebral Swelling After Cranioplasty: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Shen, Liang; Zhou, Yue; Xu, Jie; Su, Zhongzhou",Shen,"Cranioplasty is considered a low-risk operation in the field of neurosurgery following decompression craniectomy. Well-known complications after cranioplasty, such as infection, seizure, and titanium plate exposure, may not threaten the lives of patients. Unfortunately, there are many fatal complications that are underreported. In this study, we report a case and perform a literature review to introduce malignant cerebral swelling, which is regarded as a devastating complication. A 51-year-old man who was a victim of traumatic brain injury underwent emergency clot removal and decompression craniectomy. His neurologic condition improved with subsequent rehabilitation therapy, and he had left sinking skin flap syndrome where the skull was defective. Six months after the initial surgery, he underwent a cranioplasty; however, he did not recover from the uneventful anesthesia. A vacuum suction drain showed 300 mL of flow outflow had drained when his pupils dilated and fixed. An immediate computed tomography scan showed ipsilateral diffuse cerebral swelling with diffuse cerebral hemorrhage. Despite all approaches that were considered, the cerebral swelling continued to worsen until death. Cranioplasty is a high-risk procedure in some cases. Sinking skin flap syndrome and vacuum suction drain may be the main risks of a postoperative venous congestion and stasis, which may result in diffuse cerebral swelling. Once the computed tomography scan shows malignant cerebral swelling, the patient is expected to have a poor prognosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.10.102,,Cranioplasty; Malignant cerebral swelling; Sinking skin flap syndrome; Vacuum suction drainage,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Due to the wide range of benefits provided by regional anesthesia, an anesthetist should be aware of the possible options for perioperative management to best handle such polytrauma cases. In this case, agitation was managed with a bolus of benzodiazepine and maintenance infusion of dexmedetomidine while the six-hour-long surgery continued with epidural anesthesia. This patient was a smoker who had bronchospasm and underlying pneumonia precluding a high risk for postoperative ventilatory support if only general anesthesia was administered.

Our objective was to review the anesthesia management of pregnant women who underwent resection of cAVM at our institution and to provide opinions and suggestions. Herein, we report of 3 patients with cAVM rupture and hemorrhage during pregnancy who underwent neurosurgery at the 22nd, 28th, and 20th weeks of pregnancy. All 3 patients were admitted to the emergency department of our hospital due to sudden symptoms. Subsequently, their head imaging results confirmed the rupture and hemorrhage of cAVM. The rupture and hemorrhage of cAVM during pregnancy has a low incidence and high mortality, which seriously endangers the safety of the mother and fetus. For this emergency condition, craniotomy for removing intracranial lesions and clear hematoma can result in a chance of a successful delivery. Especially in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, the management goal of anesthesia is to ensure the maternofetal safety and to maintain continuous pregnancy. This article describes the process of intraoperative anesthesia management and maternal-fetal outcomes and discusses the key issues for the anesthesia management of cAVM rupture during pregnancy, including considerations of physiological changes during pregnancy and anesthesia medication, intraoperative monitoring, the maintenance of hemodynamic stability, and the control of intracranial pressure, among other considerations. Resection of intracranial lesions should be performed whenever possible while maintaining the pregnancy for better maternal and infant outcomes. The operations of the 3 pregnant women were successfully completed under our detailed anesthesia planning and careful anesthesia management. All the patients recovered well after the operation, and underwent cesarean section to give birth smoothly. The preservation of pregnancy under cAVM resection is a complex challenge for anesthesiologists, and these 3 cases provide an extensive amount of experience for anesthesia management in similar situations. Detailed anesthesia planning and careful anesthesia management by anesthesiologists are important guarantees for good maternal and fetal outcomes.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000032753,PMC9902018,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient was a 19-year-old man presenting with sudden explosive headaches with meningeal syndrome, right hemiparesis and right hypoesthesia. The cerebral CT angiography showed a left parieto-occipital and intraventricular hematoma without classic aneurysm or mycotic aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. The injected brain magnetic resonance imaging found a CVT in front of a stopped opacification of the left lateral branch of the superior sagittal sinus. The presence of fever, poor oral status and a heart murmur justified the prescription of transthoracic echodoppler. It showed vegetations on healthy aortic valves. The patient was put on antibiotics and anticoagulants with favorable evolution. The absence of usual risk factors for CVT, the negativity of thrombophilia tests, the inflammatory and prothrombotic state associated with the infection reinforce the causal link of infective endocarditis to CVT formation. The etiology of CVT is variable, can be multiple and requires a comprehensive assessment. Infective endocarditis is one of the rare etiologies of CVT. In this case, anticoagulation and antibiotic drugs are indicated, taking into account the risk of intracerebral bleeding.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal de medecine vasculaire,10.1016/j.jdmv.2022.09.001,,Antibiotic therapy; Anticoagulation; Cerebral venous thrombosis; Infective endocarditis,Case Reports; Letter,France,eng

34016062,Crossed brainstem syndrome revealing bleeding brainstem cavernous malformation: an illustrative case.,"Beucler, Nathan; Boissonneau, Sébastien; Ruf, Aurélia; Fuentes, Stéphane; Carron, Romain; Dufour, Henry",Beucler,"Since the nineteenth century, a great variety of crossed brainstem syndromes (CBS) have been described in the medical literature. A CBS typically combines ipsilateral cranial nerves deficits to contralateral long tracts involvement such as hemiparesis or hemianesthesia. Classical CBS seem in fact not to be so clear-cut entities with up to 20% of patients showing different or unnamed combinations of crossed symptoms. In terms of etiologies, acute brainstem infarction predominates but CBS secondary to hemorrhage, neoplasm, abscess, and demyelination have been described. The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of CBS caused by a bleeding episode arising from a brainstem cavernous malformation (BCM) reported in the literature. We present the case of a typical Foville syndrome in a 65-year-old man that was caused by a pontine BCM with extralesional bleeding. Following the first bleeding episode, a conservative management was decided but the patient had eventually to be operated on soon after the second bleeding event. A literature review was conducted focusing on the five most common CBS (Benedikt, Weber, Foville, Millard-Gubler, Wallenberg) on Medline database from inception to 2020. According to the literature, hemorrhagic BCM account for approximately 7 % of CBS. Microsurgical excision may be indicated after the second bleeding episode but needs to be carefully weighted up against the risks of the surgical procedure and openly discussed with the patient. In the setting of a CBS, neuroimaging work-up may not infrequently reveal a BCM requiring complex multidisciplinary team management including neurosurgical advice.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02223-7,PMC8136125,Brainstem cavernous malformation; Crossed brainstem syndrome; Developmental venous anomaly; Foville syndrome; Intracranial hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The key to a good outcome, when removing cerebral cavernous malformation, is preservation of adjacent neurovascular bundles, use of sharp dissection over blunt pulling, judicious use of cautery in and around the brainstem, and preservation of the developmental venous anomaly, when present. The authors present a case of a lateral pontine cerebral cavernous malformation that was exophytic at the lateral and peritrigeminal safe entry zones.<sup>2</sup> Neuromonitoring was used an adjunct to ensure safety of the procedure. The lesion is accessed using a keyhole retrosigmoid craniotomy (Video 1). We do not routinely use lumbar drains for these procedures as careful arachnoid dissection can result in adequate cerebrospinal fluid release. The window of access to this area is between CN 5 and the CN 7/8 complex. The arachnoid over the nerves is preserved, but the layer between the nerves is exposed to gain access to the lateral pons. The lesion is sharply dissected from the lateral pons, taking care to save the developmental venous anomaly, from which this lesion arises.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2024.01.038,,Brainstem; Cerebral cavernous malformation; Pons; Surgery,Case Reports; Video-Audio Media,United States,eng

34408717,The Efficacy of Intraoperative Passive Language Mapping for Glioma Surgery: A Case Report.,"Kanaya, Kohei; Mitsuhashi, Takumi; Kiuchi, Takafumi; Kobayashi, Sumio",Kanaya,"<b>Background:</b> Recently, electrocorticographic (ECoG) studies have emphasized the importance of gamma band-based functional mapping in the presurgical localization of the eloquent cortex. Passive functional mapping using ECoG signals provides a reliable method for identifying receptive language areas without many of the risks and limitations associated with electrical cortical stimulation. We report a surgical case of left temporal malignant glioma with intraoperative passive language mapping. <b>Case Description:</b> A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with left temporal glioma with inspection of her language difficulty. MRI showed a left temporal tumor measuring 74.6 × 50.0 × 51.5 mm in size. Real-time CortiQ-based mapping using high-gamma activity by word-listening and story-listening tasks was performed. Significant listening task-evoked high gamma activities were detected in 5 channels in the superior temporal gyrus and one channel in the middle temporal gyrus. The tumor was grossly removed except for the region corresponding to listening task-evoked high gamma activities. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms of language comprehension difficulty improved, and no new neurological deficits were observed. <b>Conclusion:</b> Intraoperative passive language mapping was successfully performed, and the patient's language function was well-preserved. Intraoperative passive language mapping, which is applicable in a short time and under general anesthesia, can be an important tool for detecting language areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.652401,PMC8364957,awake craniotomy; cortiq; glioma; high-gamma activity; intraoperative passive language mapping; real-time,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

As the number of procedures performed increases, the complications arising are likely to become more frequent, so it is advisable to bear this in mind when establishing early diagnosis and treatment. Cerebral air embolism is a rare complication after a digestive endoscopic procedure, although in the case of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), may be as high as 10%. In such cases there are usually local circumstances exist favoring the entry of air into the bloodstream, and in some cases it is the presence of a patent foramen ovale that favors the passage of air into the arterial system.

Head computered tomography angiography (CTA) and digital substraction angiography (DSA) examinations showed that the lesion was mainly vascular, approximately 3 × 5 cm in size, and supplied by occipital arteries and the muscular branches of vertebral arteries. The venous drainage of the lesions communicated with the suboccipital vein plexus and the paravertebral vein in the venous phase, indicating AVM. Postoperative histological investigation showed the lesion was a hemangioma. It was recommended for surgical removal. The surgery was carried out under general anesthesia. The lesion showed a clear boundary. The occipital artery touched the anterior margin of the lesion, was exposed and ligated, and was removed around the lesion. The lesion consisted of massive blood vessels, and the surrounding muscles were swollen, indicating IH.After the lesion was removed, the normal muscle tissue around the lesion was also removed. The patient achieved a good recovery after surgery, and pathology confirmed IH. A postoperative 1-year CTA review was performed and showed partial residual, then the radiotherapy was recommended. She refused further radiotherapy, follow-up 2 years later showed no enlargement of the lesion. Although IH rarely occurs in the occipital region, this can occur.

The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a patient with moyamoya disease complicated by pregnancy and to review the literature on other such cases. We report a 23-year-old primipara with moyamoya disease who delivered uneventfully by cesarean section under spinal anesthesia at 38 weeks of gestation. In the literature, 30 cases were reported of patients who had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease before pregnancy and delivery, and 23 patients who were symptomatic and were diagnosed for the first time with moyamoya disease in association with pregnancy. There is no evidence that pregnancy increases the risk of cerebrovascular accident or that bypass surgery decreases its risk. Poor prognosis of the patient or the newborn is mostly caused by cerebral hemorrhage and not by cerebral ischemia. It is important to control blood pressure and especially to avoid toxemia during pregnancy. Either cesarean section or vaginal delivery can be accomplished safely. Any anesthetic method can be used, provided special attention is given to avoiding hypocapnia, hypotension, and hypertension.

However, Weber syndrome induced by simple anterior choroidal artery lesions has rarely been reported. Computed tomographic angiography revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery in a 57-year-old male patient who was admitted to the Beijing Haidian Hospital with cerebral infarction. Thrombectomy to clear the occlusion of the left internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery was successfully performed in the emergency department. However, postoperative digital subtraction angiography indicated occlusion of the middle and distal segments of the left anterior choroidal artery. After recovery from anesthesia, the patient had left blepharoptosis, inability to abduct the left eye, limitation of the upward and downward gaze, left mydriasis, absence of response to light, and right hemiplegia. Complete head magnetic resonance imaging suggested left cerebral peduncle and basal ganglia infarction. Therefore, the diagnosis was that the patient had left Weber syndrome caused by a left anterior choroidal arterial embolism. When the anterior choroidal artery is the dominant supplier of blood to the medial region of the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle, the occlusion of this artery may lead to ipsilateral Weber syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Risk management and healthcare policy,10.2147/RMHP.S427893,PMC10505376,Weber syndrome; anterior choroidal artery; cerebral infarction; mechanical thrombectomy; oculomotor nerve palsy,Case Reports,England,eng

The cortical hand syndrome is a rare stroke presentation that results from infarction of the precentral gyrus leading to variable neurologic deficits mimicking peripheral nerve injuries, with no prior reports in the perioperative setting. To raise awareness of this complication among anesthesiologists, we present a case of cortical hand syndrome in a surgical patient initially suspected to have a peripheral neuropathy. A 68-yr-old male with multiple stroke risk factors underwent a nephroureterectomy under general anesthesia and thoracic epidural analgesia for urothelial carcinoma. The patient noted right-hand numbness and weakness to digits 3-5 immediately after surgery and notified his bedside nurse the following day. His symptoms were initially presumed to be a peripheral neuropathy secondary to surgical positioning. Computed tomography of the head the following day revealed an acute cortical infarct in the precentral gyrus consistent with cortical hand stroke syndrome. Subsequent neurologic consultation revealed additional subtle right-sided weakness. Further workup revealed moderate (60-80%) stenosis of the left carotid artery and he underwent a successful carotid endarterectomy one week later. His symptoms had mostly resolved six weeks later. Cortical hand stroke syndrome is a rare presentation of perioperative stroke that may be misdiagnosed as a peripheral neuropathy. Our case presentation highlights that perioperative stroke should be considered for patients presenting with neurologic deficits of the hand, particularly those with deficits in multiple peripheral nerve territories and stroke risk factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,10.1007/s12630-023-02587-z,,cortical hand stroke; peripheral neuropathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Spinal cavernomas are more uncommon and intradural extramedullary cavernomas are the most uncommon as they constitute only 3 % of spinal cavernomas. A 36-year-old female presented to our neurosurgical clinic with a history of back pain radiating to the left side of the chest with left lower extremity paresthesia and ataxia without urinary disturbance. Neurological exam showed left-sided hypoesthesia below the T9 dermatome in addition to increased patellar and Achilles reflexes on the left side. MRI showed a homogeneous intradural extramedullary mass which was hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2 and it was surgically resected. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of intradural extramedullary cavernoma. Intradural extramedullary cavernomas are extremely rare lesions that arise within the area located between the inner surface of the dura and the pial surface of the spinal cord. Up until 2022 only 40 cases of intradural extramedullary cavernomas were reported in the literature. MRI is the preferred imaging modality and pathology is the golden standard for diagnosis. Surgical resection showed very promising results and it is considered the golden standard for treating this condition. However, surgery should be performed urgently to give an optimal outcome.

A craniocervical angiogram showed a perimedullary arteriovenous fistula on the left, ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord with a single feeding artery that originated from the thyrocervical trunk and entered through the left C6 nerve root sleeve. Venous drainage was cephalad to cortical cerebellar veins and to the suboccipital plexus. A branch of the thyrocervical trunk supplying the ventral spinal cord originated close to the fistula, which precluded endovascular embolization. The patient underwent C6-T1 laminectomies for microsurgical treatment of the fistula. This case demonstrates multiple key concepts in the surgical management of these rare lesions as follows: the ventral aspect of the cervical spinal cord can be safely approached from posterior. The venous anatomy is often confusing and intraoperative angiography utilizing both indocyanine green and conventional digital subtraction techniques are of paramount importance. Unlike arteriovenous malformations, the venous drainage can be pruned to gain visualization and trace the venous anatomy retrograde to the point of the fistula.

However, the information obtained may demonstrate lesions responsible for the neurological deficits. Especially, CT scan findings may help to understand a mechanism of cerebral ischemia. Indeed, categories of cerebral ischemia are divided in three types: territorial infarctions (downstream of the territory of an artery), watershed infarctions (slow-flow at the junction of two arterial territories), and lacunar infarctions (small-vessel occlusions). Hypersensitivity reactions and type I anaphylactic IgE antibody reactions are severe potential adverse effects of sulfonamide administration, which occur in about three percent of cases. In horses, anaphylaxis is often clinically expressed as hypotension and collapse. Cardiovascular collapse may lead to multiorgan slow-flow leading to infarction with multiorgan failure and death. We report the case of a filly that suffered a presumed watershed cerebral infarction after antibiotic injection, indicated on a brain CT scan. This was attributed to a cerebral slow-flow during cardiovascular collapse, at the posterior junction of the right cerebral arteries. No abnormalities were initially identified on the CT scan; however, a review of the imaging by a radiologist specialized in cerebrovascular diseases detected a limited right occipital cortico-subcortical lesion in the visual cortex, interpreted as an ischemic scar in the watershed area related to hemodynamic infarction. This case highlights that detection of brain lesions by CT scan might require specialized knowledge and careful reading for interpretation particularly in the case of limited lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of equine veterinary science,10.1016/j.jevs.2020.102953,,CT Scan; Filly; Horse; Ischemic stroke; Visual field,Case Reports; Review,United States,eng

Successful mechanical thrombectomy (MT) achieved thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 2C. Anticoagulation was postponed due to a small risk of hemorrhagic conversion. However, the patient developed a rare bilateral M1 segment MCA occlusions on the fifth day with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 23, leading to an emergent thrombectomy, resulting in TICI 3 and TICI 2C recanalization in left and right MCAs, respectively.

She was healthy and without identified stroke risk factors other than oral contraceptive use and a patent foramen ovale without venous thromboses. A 26-year-old woman presented with nonfluent aphasia, left facial droop, and left hemianesthesia approximately 12 hours after first use of synthetic cannabis. Her other stroke risk factors included migraine with aura, oral contraceptive use, smoking, and a family history of superficial thrombophlebitis. Both women were found to have acute, large-territory infarctions of the right middle cerebral artery.

Although the entire arterial system can be affected, when coronary arteries are the main targets, Kounis syndrome needs to be considered. Cerebral artery involvement has also been suggested in rarer MC-mediator release episodes; so-called 'Kounis-like' syndrome. Cerebral ischaemic lesions can then result from low blood pressure or direct proinflammatory and/or vasoconstrictive mediator action in the cerebral arterial system. Diagnosis can be difficult in anaesthetised patients, as low blood pressure can have multiple causes. Treatment is also challenging, as administering adrenaline can worsen ischaemia. We report the first case of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced type II Kounis syndrome under general anaesthesia, complicated with severe, irreversible and subsequently fatal encephalopathy of ischaemic origin.

Radiation has been known to be a factor in the later development of aneurysms. Aneurysms have been reported to occur after radiation delivered in a variety of methods including both externally delivered radiation radiosurgery and brachytherapy. We report here an incidence of a de novo aneurysm presenting following radiosurgery treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. The patient was treated using frame-based LINAC radiosurgery receiving 90Gy to the mid cisternal extent of the nerve via a 4mm conical collimator. The patient presented with progressive hypoesthesia 11years after treatment. Imaging evaluation demonstrated the presence of an aneurysm abutting the treated trigeminal nerve. The aneurysm was successfully coil embolized. The patient's facial hypoesthesia, however, did not improve following embolization. We believe that this is the first report of such an aneurysm occurring after radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia. De novo aneurysms are a recognized long term complication of radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatment. This report shows such aneurysms can occur with very small treatment volumes. Late sensory changes following radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia should prompt workup for de novo aneurysms as well as other late adverse radiation effects.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2016.12.026,,Aneurysm; Linear accelerator; Radiation; Radiosurgery; Trigeminal neuralgia,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 80 minutes after onset revealed no acute ischemic stroke lesions, but magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated complete occlusion of the right vertebral artery. Based on these neurological and MRA findings, atypical lateral medullary infarction was suggested, and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) was started 178 minutes after onset. Right hemiplegia improved immediately after IV-tPA administration. MRI performed on hospital day 2 showed an acute ischemic lesion on the right side of the medulla oblongata, resulting in a diagnosis of Opalski syndrome. Opalski syndrome is a rare subtype of Wallenberg syndrome accompanied by hemiplegia of the side ipsilateral to the lesion, and expansion of the stroke lesion to the corticospinal tract below the pyramidal decussation is considered to cause ipsilateral hemiplegia. Based on this case and previous reports, Opalski syndrome should be considered when limb ataxia and crossed sensory deficit are observed among patients with hyperacute-onset hemiplegia, and IV t-PA therapy should be considered even in the absence of neurological findings such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and Horner's signs and radiological evidence of acute ischemic stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104806,,Opalski syndrome; Wallenberg syndrome; cerebral infarction; recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator; vertebral artery; vertebral artery dissection,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Resource limitations are one of the basic reasons for avoiding AC in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study is to describe the simplified protocol of awake brain surgery that can be implemented in a limited financial setting in LMICs and to share our first experience. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with tumor of the left frontotemporal lobes, all involving Broca's and Wernicke's areas, were operated on using AC. Brain mapping was executed using mono- and bipolar direct electrical stimulation including cortical and subcortical (axonal) mapping profiles, investigating basically cortical language centers. Neither neuronavigation nor intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized due to financial constraints. AC was performed successfully in 23 of 25 patients, achieving a near-total resection in 16 (69.5%) patients, subtotal resection in 4 patients (17.39%) patients, and partial resection in 3 (13.04%) patients. In two patients, due to psychological instability-agitation and fear during the awake phase-speech test was not technically possible, so they were reintubated by giving them GA. There was no mortality in the early or postoperative period. In spite of the absence of advanced pre- and intraoperative technologies such as intraoperative MRI and navigation systems, AC can be safely performed in LMICs. These tools along with intraoperative cortical mapping and language testing can guarantee better surgical outcomes and quality of life. However, our study confirms that omitting these tools does not make a huge difference in getting good results with AC and that AC is not absolutely impossible. AC can be performed successfully, preserving eloquent brain areas, with minimum and basic set of the armamentarium like system for cortical and subcortical intraoperative neurostimulation which provides cortical/subcortical brain mapping.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Asian journal of neurosurgery,10.1055/s-0043-1771326,PMC10749855,awake craniotomy; brain tumor; cortical mapping; electrophysiological monitoring; language testing,Case Reports,India,eng

There have been few reports on how to diagnose and deal with such malformed celiomesenteric trunk aneurysms till now. This paper tries to summarize the experience of how to expose and excise such kind of aneurysm according to the seven cases' data. The clinic data were collected retrospectively. There were seven cases with celiomesenteric trunk aneurysm from February 2000 to February 2013, including 5 males and 2 females aged 35~62. The operations were done including aneurysm resection and vascular reconstruction under general anesthesia. The operated patients were followed-up at the sixth month and each year post operation. The vascular stomas were detected or examined by Color Doppler Sonography, spiral Computed Tomography angiography (SCTA). The seven operated patients were cured and discharged from hospital, and they were followed up for 3~10 years (mean time 5 years), with four patients being followed up longer than 5 years. No sign of intestinal ischemia or hepatic ischemia or splenic ischemia was found, and no image of anastomosis stricture or stenosis was found during the follow-up. Five patients are alive now while two patients were dead, with one dying of large area myocardial infarction unexpectedly at 6 years post operation and the other dying of cerebral infarction abruptly at 4 years post operation. It is an effective and safe method to treat the celiomesenteric trunk aneurysm by using by-pass operation with artificial blood vessels, originating from inferior kidney aorta to visceral arteries including hepatic artery, splenic artery and superior mesenteric artery.

Pain, swelling, stiffness, and hypoesthesia are observed as manifestations. The presence of a trophic ulcer is accompanied by a range of severe manifestations. The assaults occur in three distinct phases, namely vasospastic, plethoric, and erythema. Various approaches improve the overall well-being of a patient. It is possible to differentiate between primary and secondary Raynaud's syndrome, the latter being linked to systemic diseases. The application of botulin toxin is commonly indicated in several medical conditions including focal dystonia, spasticity with or without contractures, paraparesis in children with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, brain injuries, involuntary muscle hyperactivity of a non-dystonic nature, pain management, strabismus, nystagmus, sialorrhea, and esthetic medicine.

Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed according to a radiologist's recommendation because the CT results showed areas of slightly low attenuation in the frontoparieto-occipital lobes bilaterally, suggesting PRES; otherwise, ischemic events. MRI showed subcortical increased T(2) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) intensity in the occipitoparietal regions bilaterally with slight increase in the apparent diffusion coefficient signal on diffusion-weighted imaging, which confirmed a diagnosis of PRES.

30189865,Iatrogenic cerebral arterial gas embolism from flushing of the arterial line in two calves.,"Casoni, Daniela; Mirra, Alessandro; Goepfert, Christine; Petruccione, Ilaria; Spadavecchia, Claudia",Casoni,"Measurement of invasive blood pressure as reflection of blood flow and tissue perfusion is often carried out in animals during general anesthesia. Intravascular cannulation offers the potential for gas to directly enter the circulation and lead to arterial gas embolism. Cerebral arterial gas embolism may cause a spectrum of adverse effects ranging from very mild symptoms to severe neurological injury and death. Although several experimental models of arterial gas embolism have been published, there are no known published reports of accidental iatrogenic cerebral arterial gas embolism from flushing of an arterial line in animals. A 7-day-old Red Holstein-Friesian calf (No. 1) and a 28-day-old Holstein-Friesian calf (No. 2) underwent hot iron disbudding and sham disbudding, respectively, under sedation and cornual nerve anesthesia. Invasive arterial blood pressure was measured throughout the procedure and at regular intervals during the day. Before disbudding, a sudden and severe increase of blood pressure was observed following flushing of the arterial line. Excitation, hyperextension of the limbs and rapid severe horizontal nystagmus appeared shortly thereafter. Over the following minutes, symptoms ameliorated and blood pressure normalized in both cases. Prompt diagnosis was missed in calf 1; supportive fluid therapy was provided. Severe deterioration of neurologic status occurred in the following 24 h and culminated with stupor. The calf was euthanized for ethical reasons and the histological examination revealed extensive cerebral injury. Treatment of calf 2 consisted of supportive fluid and oxygen therapy; furosemide (1 mg/kg IV) was injected twice. Calf 2 appeared clinically normal after 2 h and showed no neurologic sequelae on a 3-month-follow up period. There are no known reports of cerebral arterial gas embolism following flushing of the auricular arterial line in calves. The injection of a small amount of air at high pressure in a peripheral artery may lead to a significant cerebral insult. The clinical presentation is non-specific and can favour misdiagnosis and delay of therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,10.1186/s13028-018-0405-5,PMC6127953,Calf; Cerebral infarcts; DIC; Gas embolism; Invasive blood pressure,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It is often related to the presence of predisposing factors, such as pregnancy, puerperium, oral contraceptive use, and malignancies. Headache is the most common symptom. We describe a case of a patient who underwent spinal anesthesia who had postoperative headache complicated with CVT. Male patient, 30 years old, ASA 1, who underwent uneventful arthroscopic knee surgery under spinal anesthesia. Forty-eight hours after the procedure, the patient showed frontal, orthostatic headache that improved when positioned supine. Diagnosis of sinusitis was made in the general emergency room, and he received symptomatic medication. In subsequent days, the headache worsened with holocranial location and with little improvement in the supine position. The patient presented with left hemiplegia followed by tonic-clonic seizures. He underwent magnetic resonance venography; diagnosed with CVT. Analysis of procoagulant factors identified the presence of lupus anticoagulant antibody. The patient received anticonvulsants and anticoagulants and was discharged eight days without sequelae. Any patient presenting with postural headache after spinal anesthesia, which intensifies after a plateau, loses its orthostatic characteristic or become too long, should undergo imaging tests to rule out more serious complications, such as CVT. The loss of cerebrospinal fluid leads to dilation and venous stasis that, coupled with the traction caused by the upright position, can lead to TVC in some patients with prothrombotic conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,10.1016/j.bjan.2014.09.005,,Cerebral venous thrombosis; Complications post‐dural puncture headache; Complicações cefaleia pós‐punção da dura‐máter; Raquianestesia; Spinal anesthesia; Trombose venosa cerebral,Case Reports; Journal Article,Brazil,por

However, stent migration has been an unusual complication. Until recently, among some types of FDs, the migration of the flow-redirection endoluminal device (FRED; MicroVention Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) has almost never been reported. Herein, we report a case of acute distal migration of a single FRED secondary to in-stent thrombi with symptomatic ischemic stroke and review the literature on the distal migration of FDs. A 35-year-old woman was diagnosed with a left unruptured internal carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm. A 3.5 mm diameter and 17 mm long FRED was adequately deployed. The patient awoke from general anesthesia without neurological deficits. However, shortly after the procedure, the patient presented with conjugate deviation toward the left side, right severe hemiparesis, and total aphasia. Although the symptoms gradually improved, angiography was performed. Angiography revealed some in-stent thrombi and distal migration of the FRED, and initially, one of the left M2 inferior trunk branches was occluded by an embolic thrombus. However, the thrombus spontaneously migrated distally without any specific treatment. Finally, despite leaving the migrated stent <i>in situ</i>, the flow almost completely improved, and the patient's neurologic deficits disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging following treatment revealed only a small cerebral infarction in the left temporo-occipital area. Distal migration of an FD in an acute setting, including the FRED, may occur even following appropriate placement. In-stent thrombosis can cause distal stent migration and thromboembolic stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_1279_2021,PMC8986641,Flow diverter; Flow-redirection endoluminal device; Stent migration,Case Reports,United States,eng
34646648,Awake Craniotomy for Resection of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation: Initial Experience From a Low- and Middle-Income Country.,"Bakhshi, Saqib Kamran; Ather, Mishaal; Tariq, Quratulain; Anis, Saad Bin; Enam, Syed Ather",Bakhshi,"Global health has shown progress over the years; however, neurosurgical care has not followed the same trajectory due to it being presumably resource intensive. Awake craniotomy (AC) is a neurosurgical technique that can improve neurological outcomes, can potentially reduce costs and hospital stay, and can be easily employed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It has proven to be beneficial in surgical resection of tumors located in the critical areas of the brain, but there is limited literature to support AC for resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVM). We present four cases of AVM that were successfully treated surgically under awake settings in a developing country. Two of the AVMs were Spetzler-Martin grade (SMG) 3, one was SMG 4, and one was SMG 1. All the patients underwent successful excision of AVMs, and the postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was negative for any residual. They had a total hospital stay of three to five days with a mean postoperative stay of two days. Only one patient showed transient conductive dysphasia, which resolved on subsequent follow-ups, and none of the patients developed any long-term neurological deficit. There are limited data from LMICs regarding the benefits of using AC for AVMs. However, our cases show that this technique can be applied for AVM resection, particularly in eloquent areas of the brain (parts of the cerebral cortex that control vision, language, sensory, and motor functions), to minimize potential neurological deficits. Even though it requires careful selection of cases, and needs a higher level of microsurgical and neuro-anesthesia expertise, it can lead to better postoperative outcomes, lesser morbidity, and a shorter hospital stay, contributing to low resource utilization, making it feasible in a resource-limited setting.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.17596,PMC8482807,arteriovenous malformation; awake craniotomy; digital subtraction angiography; global neurosurgery; spetzler-martin grade,Case Reports,United States,eng

We describe the unique and rare case of a dural arteriovenous fistula treated by transarterial embolization and complicated by an intraventricular hemorrhage. We aim to emphasize some central aspects of the perioperative management of these patients in order to help improving the future approach of similar cases. A 59-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed Cognard Type IV dural arteriovenous fistula presented for transarterial embolization, performed outside the operating room, under total intravenous anesthesia. The procedure underwent without complications and the intraoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration of the fistula. In the early postoperative period, the patient presented with clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure attributable to a later diagnosed intraventricular hemorrhage, which conditioned placement of a ventricular drain, admission to an intensive care unit, cerebral vasospasm and a prolonged hospital stay. Throughout the perioperative period, there were no changes in the cerebral brain oximetry. The patient was discharged without neurological sequelae. Intraventricular hemorrhage may be a serious complication after the endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula.

Injuries that traverse (with complete penetration of) the brainstem are often fatal, with survivors rarely seen in clinical practice. Here, the authors describe the case of a 16-year-old male who suffered and recovered from an accidental transorbital PHI traversing the brainstem-the first case of complete neurological recovery following such injury. Neuroimaging captured the trajectory of the initial injury. A delayed-onset carotid cavernous fistula and the subsequent development of internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms were managed by endovascular embolization.The authors also review the relevant literature. Sixteen cases of imaging-confirmed PHI traversing the brainstem have been reported, 14 involving the pons and 12 penetrating via the transorbital route. Management and outcome of PHI are informed by object velocity, material, entry point, trajectory, relationship to neurovascular structures, and the presence of a retained foreign body. Trauma resuscitation is followed by a careful neurological examination and appropriate neuroimaging. Ophthalmological examination is performed if transorbital penetration is suspected, as injuries may be occult; the potential for neurovascular complications highlights the value of angiography. The featured case shows that complete recovery is possible following injury that traverses the brainstem.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of neurosurgery.

In most cases, treatment strategy is usually determined according to the patient's Spetzler-Martin grade. However, in the present case, we were not able to treat the patient following the usual guidelines because of neurological symptoms and pregnancy. We describe a rare case of a 31-year-old woman in the 15<sup>th</sup> week of gestation who presented with an AVM in the anterior perforated substance (APS). She suffered a sudden coma and hemiplegia. A computed tomographic scan showed an enhanced mass and a huge hematoma in the basal ganglia and temporal lobe. The hematoma was successfully evacuated in an endoscopic procedure. Angiography showed that a 25-mm nidus in the APS was fed by the anterior choroidal arteries (AChAs) and the lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs). Therefore, we attempted to remove the nidus because the patient became alert with mild aphasia and hemiparesis 10 days after hemorrhage. The feeding arteries were cut under motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring, and the nidus was totally resected leaving two of four AChAs and a single artery with several LSAs. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she gave birth to a healthy baby by caesarian delivery 122 days after the hemorrhage with only minor sequelae. Surgical strategy with a device-administered anesthesia are suitable for removing large AVMs even in pregnant women and for the successful outcome of their pregnancies. Even after recovering from a coma and hemiplegia, MEP monitoring is effective for removing large AVMs even when located in the APS.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/sni.sni_220_17,PMC6000718,Anterior perforated substance; arteriovenous malformation; motor evoked potential; pregnancy,Case Reports,United States,eng

We looked at associated factors in a consecutive series of patients who underwent thrombectomy with the same endovascular device. We included all patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior or posterior circulation, who underwent thrombectomy with the same thrombectomy device for acute stroke from 2013 to 2016. Distal embolization was defined as any movement of the thrombus into a previously uninvolved portion of the cerebral vasculature or the presence of thrombotic material further downstream in the affected vessel, which occurred after the initial angiogram. We studied patient-related as well as technical factors to determine their association with distal emboli. In this study 167 consecutive acute stroke patients treated with the emboTrap® device (Cerenovus, Irvine, CA, USA) were included with a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 15 (range 2-30) and mean age of 67 years (SD 13.1 years). Of the patients in our cohort 20 (11.9%) experienced distal emboli, with 2.3% into a new territory and 9.6% into a territory distal to the primary occlusion. On univariate analysis, age, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), posterior circulation occlusions, and general anesthesia were associated with distal emboli. On multivariate analysis, only posterior circulation occlusions (odds ratio OR 4.506 95% confidence interval CI 1.483-13.692, p = 0.008) were significantly associated with distal emboli. Distal embolization was not significantly associated with worse functional outcomes at 3 months, increased mortality or increased bleeding risk.

An 86-year-old man with bilateral frontotemporal subdural effusion, hematoma, and cerebral hernia was admitted to our department and treated with bilateral burr hole surgery and closed-system drainage under local anesthesia. After the operation, computed tomography (CT) showed AIH in the left temporal and occipital lobe, and then a series of head CT showed that the hematoma gradually increased day by day. This patient had a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and taking warfarin. He was treated conservatively, but had not recovered at discharge after 1 month. We reviewed the relevant literature and analyzed the operation opportunity, causes of cerebral hemorrhage, and preventive measures in similar patients. We suppose that the coagulation abnormality and rapid fluctuations of intracranial pressure were the main causes of development of AIH in our patient. Several possible reasons such as brain shift and impaired vascular autoregulation are also associated with postoperative AIH. We must be aware of this complication and keep some preventive measures in our mind.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Ibrain,10.1002/ibra.12022,PMC10528771,acute intracerebral hemorrhage; chronic subdural hematoma; drainage,Case Reports,United States,eng
35812084,Case Report: Can Ruptured Aneurysms in the Hypoplastic and Plexiform Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Arteries Be Safely Occluded?,"Hou, Kun; Yu, Jinlu",Hou,"Aneurysms arising from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are not rare and may originate from the proximal or peripheral segment of the PICA. However, when the affected PICA is hypoplastic and plexiform, it is difficult to occlude the aneurysm without sacrificing the parent vessel, the PICA. This type of aneurysm is rare, and whether it is safe to occlude the aneurysm and the parent artery, in cases of a ruptured aneurysm of the hypoplastic and plexiform PICA, has not been adequately studied and is still open to debate. In this report, two patients with ruptured aneurysms in the hypoplastic and plexiform PICA were presented. Both patients were admitted to our hospital for subarachnoid hemorrhage. After team discussions between the neurosurgeons and neurointerventionalists, the aneurysm and parent PICA had to be occluded <i>via</i> endovascular treatment under general anesthesia. One of the patients developed postprocedural brainstem infarction and exhibited favorable recovery. The other patient died of pulmonary infection, although improvement in the postoperative state was observed. Although rare, aneurysms can originate from the hypoplastic and plexiform PICA. Occluding the aneurysm and hypoplastic parent PICA <i>via</i> endovascular treatment might be a reasonable option.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2022.904863,PMC9263357,aneurysm; endovascular treatment; hypoplastic; plexiform; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

However, it is uncommon in the young population. The etiologies of stroke in young patients are different compared with those for the elderly population. They include various non-atherosclerotic angiopathies, hematological conditions, and inflammatory disorders. We report the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the emergency department because he noticed that his right hand had become clumsy. He first noticed this symptom five days before his presentation, but he noticed that his symptom had improved significantly since it began. He reported that he had episodes of neck pain and pain around the ear. He visited the family physician clinic several times for this complaint and was diagnosed as having a temporomandibular joint disorder. Neurological examination revealed decreased muscle strength in the right upper limb with a power of 4/5 along with a sensory deficit. The coordination was intact. No gait ataxia was noted. Considering the patient's age, the initial diagnosis was a demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. It demonstrated an increased signal intensity in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery representing a left-sided infarction. Subsequently, the patient underwent computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out any structural malformation. The scan showed the presence of an elongated styloid process that appeared in close proximity to the neck vasculature. These radiological findings are consistent with Eagle syndrome. The patient underwent surgical resection of the styloid process. Eagle syndrome is a rare clinical condition that may have a myriad of clinical presentations. A high index of suspicion for this condition is vital to reach the diagnosis. Physicians should keep this condition in the differential diagnosis of stroke in the young population with no risk factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.21102,PMC8829662,case report; eagle's syndrome; neck pain; str; temporomandibular disorder,Case Reports; Retracted Publication,United States,eng

Differentiating the ischemic core from the associated penumbra is tremendously important in tailoring an effective therapeutic strategy and potential intervention. Additionally, the degree of cell damage adjacent to the ischemic core may be either reversible or irreversible, which may also affect clinical outcomes. We describe a case of a 58-year-old female, who was diagnosed with global aphasia and fluctuating right-sided hypoesthesia. Multimodal MR imaging analysis was obtained, with cerebral blood flow and mean transit time , demonstrating an infarcted core with an even larger penumbra, suggesting potentially salvageable tissue. We concluded that quantified perfusion imaging data should be used in combination with other MR protocols to determine at-risk tissues.

Owing to its rarity, there is no guideline to support the decision of selecting a conservative or a surgical approach. Management of BHS is dependent on each patient. A 13-year-old girl presented with transient visual disturbance, hypoesthesia, and paralysis of the left side of the body. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute cerebral infarction in the right thalamus, and magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery and dilation of V3 of the left VA. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a left VA dissecting aneurysm at V3 and left VA occlusion at the level of C1-C2 during neck rotation to the right. A dynamic x-ray suggested atlantoaxial joint instability, and three-dimensional computed tomography revealed aplasia of C1 lamina and atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation. BHS with left VA dissecting aneurysm caused by atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation was diagnosed. We performed C1-C2 posterior fusion by the Goel-Harms technique. Stroke did not recur, and computed tomography angiography obtained 8 months postoperatively demonstrated a decrease in the dissecting aneurysm. To our knowledge, this is the first case of BHS with VA dissecting aneurysm and aplasia of C1 lamina.

The patient developed hypoesthesia and paresthesia in the right upper lip and hand; however, the weakness was not severe. Twenty-five days after the ICH onset, the manual muscle test results were normal, but he had difficulty eating and shaving because of decreased hand dexterity. The rehabilitation focused on improving fine hand motor function and endurance. On the 94th day after ICH onset, paresthesia remained only in the fingertips, and the upper lip sensory change disappeared. Patients with sensory symptoms in the perioral area, hands, and brain lesions were previously referred to as having cheiro-oral syndrome (COS).

A 40-year-old man was admitted for sudden-onset headache, nausea and vomiting, and transient right arm hypoesthesia. Computed tomography scan showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage with intracerebral hemorrhage within the interhemispheric fissure, but computed tomography angiography failed to identify any aneurysms.

However, the definite rupture site remained unidentifiable. After interdisciplinary consultation, endovascular treatment was favored, and complete occlusion of both DACAAs was achieved by coiling without stent placement. During coiling of the right DACAA, a thrombus in the right callosomarginal artery formed, and treatment with abciximab (ReoPro) was initiated to dissolve the thrombus. After treatment, the patient presented with right leg paresis; however, computed tomography did not show any ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage increase, or vasospasm.

The leg paresis had recovered to a grade 3/5. Rapid identification of the rupture site in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple aneurysms is crucial for initiating optimal treatment. In patients with mirror aneurysms in close proximity to each other, this is not easily accomplished, complicating treatment decisions. Although clipping has been the standard for DACAA occlusion, coiling should be taken into consideration as a viable alternative.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.05.259,,Coil embolization; Distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms; Endovascular treatment; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Mirror aneurysms; Outcome; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

One patient with TBI and eight normal control subjects were recruited. A 64-year-old woman who had suffered a motor vehicle accident presented with a persisting tingling sensation and pain in her right upper and lower extremities at 3 weeks after onset. The patient showed impaired touch sensation, but normal proprioception. Diffusion tensor imaging was performed at 1 month after onset. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were measured using a region of interest method along the STP. DTT showed normal STP integrities as compared with normal controls. However, the FA values of the left STP at the thalamus were more than 2 SD decreased. The diminished FA value of the left STP in the left thalamus seems to indicate injury of the left ventrolateroposterior nucleus. Central pain and impaired touch sensation of right extremities supports the presence of left STP injury at the ventroposterolateral nucleus in this patient. It is believed that DTT for the STP provides a useful means of detecting thalamic injury in TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.771794,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Such a presentation secondary to a conversion reaction is very rare, especially in the pediatric age group. The authors report an adolescent presenting with acute complete left-sided hemiplegia and sensory loss together with decreased tendon reflexes mimicking an acute arterial stroke. Examination revealed Hoover's sign was present and the patient was oblivious to his stern neurological state. Movement of his paralytic limbs was observed during sleep. Cortical and spinal CT, cortical MRI, motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and a PET study were all normal. As such, the diagnosis of psychogenic hemiplegia was established, apparently within a period that the patient had experienced severe emotional stress while questioning his gender identity. After three days, the adolescent began to move the paralytic limbs along gradual resolution of sensory deficit, leading to complete clinical recovering within two months. Although extremely rare, a conversion reaction should be taken into account in children presenting with acute hemiplegia and anaesthesia, even accompanied with decreased tendon reflexes, when the patient is oblivious to his alleged grave state, and when clinical observations such as Hoover's sign remain intact, substantiated by normal extensive radiological and neurophysiological investigation.

We present the case of a 63-yr-old woman with a diffuse glioma centered in the left supplemental motor area (SMA) and extending throughout the cingulate gyrus. In the video, we demonstrate the principles developed by the senior author for trimodal motor mapping under general anesthesia. Trimodal motor mapping includes direct stimulation of the cortex with a strip electrode, use of the bipolar stimulator for cortical and subcortical mapping, and use of the monopolar stimulator for subcortical motor mapping. We highlight technical principles required to safely resect these tumors, including the key anatomic landmarks and approach to SMA/cingulate lesions, techniques for subpial dissection, and preservation of en passage vessels. Patients with SMA tumors will almost always have a deficit after SMA resection, but if motor pathways are preserved and can be stimulated to produce movement at the end of the case, then the deficit will almost always improve, as was the case with this patient. Initially, postoperatively, she was nonverbal and hemiplegic, but by postoperative day 7 she recovered her speech significantly, was naming three of three objects, and was moving her right side. By 6 wk postoperative, she was ambulating independently and had normal speech. This case demonstrates the principles and techniques necessary for achieving maximal safe resection of tumors adjacent to the motor pathways with the patient under general anesthesia.

Cerebral angiography revealed dural AVF draining into spinal perimedullary veins at the left transverse-sigmoid sinus. The patient was treated by transvenous embolization under local anesthesia. A microcatheter proceeded to the left sigmoid sinus via the internal jugular vein, and embolization of the sinus was performed using coils without complications. The patient's swallowing difficulties improved over a few days after the embolization, and one month later, there remained only a slight mild hemiparesis and hemisensory disturbance.

35133444,[Thalamic infarction following paradoxical embolism during total hip replacement : Case report and pathophysiological considerations].,"Brandt, L; Albert, S; Brandt, K L",Brandt,"Because of a painful right-sided coxarthrosis a 57-year-old female patient underwent a cementless total arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Except for Asperger's syndrome and an occlusion of a vein in her left eye she stated no other diseases or complaints, especially no cardiac problems. Postoperatively she developed neurological symptoms of left-sided hemiparesis and hemihypesthesia. A cranial computer tomography was performed and a right-sided infarction of the thalamic region was found. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm were detected 5 days later. The incidence of a PFO is given as 25% of the population. A paradoxical air embolism in the presence of a PFO is a feared complication in neurosurgical interventions in a semi-sitting or sitting position. Corpuscular emboli, such as bone, cement, fat or wound debris may be the reason for paradoxical embolisms in combination especially with partial or total hip replacement. The kind of embolism in the case described could not be clarified. Deep vein thrombosis or cardiac arrhythmia could be excluded. Therefore, it can be considered most likely that the operation site was the source of the embolism. The trigger for a paradoxical embolism is a reversal of the pressure difference between the right and left atria: normally the left atrial pressure exceeds the right atrial pressure by ca. 2-4 mm Hg, resulting possibly in a small clinically irrelevant left-to-right shunt. If the pulmonary arterial circulation is compromised and pulmonary vascular resistance increases, the pressure gradient between the left and right atria reverses and a right-to-left shunt can occur causing a paradoxical embolism. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation during anesthesia could be an important reason for a shunt reversal between the right and left atria and therefore favoring a paradoxical embolism but the pathophysiological role of PEEP has not yet been finally clarified.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Die Anaesthesiologie,10.1007/s00101-022-01094-y,,Acute ischemic stroke; Intracardiac Shunt; Patent foramen ovale; Perioperative complications; Positive end-expiratory pressure,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,ger

CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.195,,Central post-stroke pain; Intermittent stimulation; Spinal cord stimulation; Thalamic pain,Case Reports,United States,eng

A 79-year-old man, with embolic occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and large hemispheric infarction involving the thalamus, suffered a right hemiplegia and expressive aphasia. One year poststroke, severe right-sided facial, scalp, arm, and trunk pain developed and was exacerbated by any tactile contact. Medical treatment had failed. Medical illness, including mandatory anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, precluded surgical procedures. Minimally invasive radiosurgery was offered as an alternative. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were used to localize the left CMN. A single shot of 140 Gy was delivered to the 100% isodose line by using the 4-mm collimator helmet. The patient was evaluated at regular intervals. By 12 weeks posttreatment, he had significant improvements in pain control and his ability to tolerate physical contact during activities of daily living. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated baseline encephalomalacia from his prior stroke, and signal changes in the left CMN consistent with gamma irradiation-based thalamotomy. Currently, nearly 7 years after radiosurgery, he continues to enjoy a marked reduction in pain without the need of analgesic medications. Thalamic pain syndrome is generally refractory to conventional treatment. Neurosurgical interventions provide modest benefit and carry associated risks of invasive surgery and anesthesia. The CMN is readily localized with neuroimaging and is an approximate target to reduce the suffering aspect of pain. In this case, radiosurgery was a safe and effective treatment, providing durable symptom control and improved quality of life.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/sup.2006.105.7.222,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using the intravenous xenon-133 technique before and after AVM resection, during both hypocapnia and normocapnia at each stage. Intraoperative changes in CBF were related to a risk score system based on the patient's history and preoperative angiograms. Seven otherwise healthy patients undergoing spinal surgery were studied to control for anesthetic effects.

The baseline CBF and CO2 reactivity were not different from the control group. There was a weak correlation between the risk score and the percentage of change in the ipsilateral CBF, with a trend for the patients with the lowest risk to have the lowest CBF changes after resection. There was no relationship between CO2 reactivity and risk grade. None of the patients awoke from anesthesia with unexpected neurological deficits. The highest CBF increases were associated with postoperative brain swelling in one patient and fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in another. Both patients had normal CO2 reactivity before excision. One patient suffered postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, attributable to technical problems, and had no increase in CBF. We conclude that, with an acute increase in the arteriovenous pressure gradient (and cerebral perfusion pressure) that results from shunt obliteration, there is an immediate global effect of AVM resection to increase CBF.

As previous studies have reported perioperative development and recurrence of PRES, a cautious anesthetic management of the syndrome is required. We describe the anesthetic management for oral surgery in a patient with multiple sclerosis and a history of PRES, both of which are risk factors of recurrent PRES. Although we faced a dilemma regarding the management method of anesthesia, we finally performed intravenous sedation for the surgery without any complications. Appropriate preoperative evaluation and anesthetic management are important to maintain hemodynamics and avoid recurrence of PRES.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",10.1111/scd.12717,,multiple sclerosis; oral surgery; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; sedation,Case Reports,United States,eng

To date, little information is known regarding the risks and outcomes of cosmetic tourism, especially potential stroke complications. Here, we present a case of fungal meningitis in the setting of medical tourism leading to ischemic strokes and vasospasm. We describe an immunocompetent 29-year-old female patient who initially presented with intractable headaches and an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile who was eventually diagnosed with Fusarium solani meningitis as a part of a common source outbreak in Matamoros, Mexico. These patients were part of a cohort who underwent cosmetic procedures requiring spinal anesthesia. This report also highlights the unusual clinical course leading to poor outcomes in such conditions. The patient initially presented with headaches, papilledema, elevated opening pressure on the spinal tap, abnormal CSF studies, and eventually developed ischemic strokes and hydrocephalus. CSF showed positive beta D-Glucan with repeated negative CSF fungal cultures. A cerebral angiogram revealed extensive basilar artery vasospasm that led to ischemic strokes. Continued clinical worsening and lack of response to antifungal treatment prompted further imaging that revealed significant non-obstructive hydrocephalus subsequently complicated by spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. CSF PCR for Fusarium solani species was positive days after her passing. This novel case highlights fungal meningitis caused by Fusarium solani complicated by bilateral ischemic strokes stemming from basilar artery vasospasm. Complications from medical tourism impact not only individual patients but also the health systems of both countries. Professional and regulatory entities for cosmetic surgeries must highlight and educate patients on the risks and complications of cosmetic surgeries happening abroad. Physicians should be aware of ongoing outbreaks and possible complications of these procedures.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2023.107432,,"Fungal meningitis; Spinal anesthesia; Vasospasm, Medical tourism",Review; Case Reports,United States,eng

A 30-year-old female arrived at the emergency room with a sudden headache and left sided weakness and sensory loss. In her past medical history, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 1 year prior, and subsequently underwent a breast conserving mastectomy with whole breast radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with tamoxifen. At the time of admission, computed tomography showed a small acute intracerebral hemorrhage at the right parietal cortex, and magnetic resonance imaging showed that a dural AVF at the SSS with a prominent and tortuous venous enhancement along the centrum semiovale was present. Cerebral angiography showed that the dural AVF at the mid-portion of the SSS with meningeal arterial feeding vessels entering the wall of the SSS, then draining through the dilated cortical veins. Our patient had no signs of active malignancy or any abnormalities in her coagulation profile, so it can be concluded that the tamoxifen was the likely cause of the SSS thrombosis and dural AVF. The dural AVF was treated by an endovascular coil embolization for the arterialized segment of the SSS. The patient dramatically recovered favorably from left side motor and sensory deficit. The best clinical approach is to screen potential patients of tamoxifen hormonal therapy and educate them on the sign and symptoms of life threatening thromboembolic events while taking tamoxifen.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,10.3340/jkns.2015.57.3.204,PMC4373050,Breast cancer; Dural fistula; Superior sagittal sinus; Tamoxifen,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

29794278,A case report of a thalamic stroke associated with sudden disappearance of severe chronic low back pain.,"Shanthanna, Harsha",Shanthanna,"Chronic pain conditions are associated with neuroplasticity within the central nervous system. In most patients the maladaptive consequence of neuroplasticity supports prolonged course of chronic pain, despite the absence of a commensurate etiology. From a pain neuromatrix perspective it can involve three different circuits within the central nervous system; the classical sensory pathway, the limbic system pathway, and the associative pathways involving the parietal cortical connections. Although this can be conceptualized as a fluid system composed of several interacting networks, it can be broadly separated into a nociceptive specific network of spino-thalamic neurons and second order neurons beyond thalamus that are not nociceptor specific. Thalamus acts as an important relay station that conveys nociceptive signaling to higher centres. Neuroplastic changes can potentially involve any parts within this neuromatrix. It is very uncommon to observe the sudden disappearance of such a chronic pain condition. In this case report, the author describes the clinical course of a patient with severe chronic low back pain (CLBP), whose pain suddenly disappeared after a stroke involving his left thalamus. Although extremely rare, existing case reports of such disappearance of pain with a secondary stroke in patients suffering from central post stroke pain (CPSP) are reviewed. The author further postulates hypotheses that could potentially explain this phenomenon based on the existing knowledge. Although extremely rare and unpredictable, a thalamic stroke involving areas that are involved in chronic pain signaling can potentially lead to disappearence of an existing chronic pain condition. This is the first case report of such sudden disappearence of CLBP with well established nociceptive pathology supported by clinical and imaging findings. This unique case report could potentially generate ideas for future research and clinical treatment in the field of neuromodulation and brain stimulation.",{},,Scandinavian journal of pain,10.1515/sjpain-2017-0169,,deep brain stimulation; neuromodulation; neuroplasticity; post-stroke pain; thalamic pain; thalamic stroke,Case Reports,Germany,eng

Rapid, accurate diagnosis allows for specific treatments that optimize outcome, but diagnosis can be challenging in this population. We present a case of postpartum herniation due to intracranial hypotension in a patient with eclampsia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Case report. A 26-year-old woman developed headache on postpartum day (PD) 1 after cesarean section with epidural anesthesia. Over the next 3 days, she developed progressively worsening headache and hypertension. On PD 5, she had a generalized seizure, leading to endotracheal intubation, propofol infusion, and transfer to our institution. By PD 6, she opened her eyes to voice, followed commands, moved all extremities, and had briskly reactive 4 mm pupils. MRI showed L parasagittal ICH with minimal mass effect, edema consistent with PRES, and brain descent with obliteration of the basal cisterns and tonsillar herniation. Later on PD 6, after diuresis for pulmonary edema, she became unresponsive with a dilated and nonreactive left pupil. She was laid flat for transport to CT, with improvement in arousal and pupil reactivity within 5 min. Intravascular volume was repleted with normal saline and albumin, and she was placed in the Trendelenburg position. Over the subsequent 8 h, she developed a dilated and nonreactive left pupil whenever her head was raised to horizontal. Her head position was gradually successfully raised over 48 h without need for a lumbar epidural blood patch. She was discharged home on PD 13 with only mild left arm dysmetria. Intracranial hypotension may coexist with other potential causes of cerebral herniation in the postpartum period.

Patients were selected if they had stenosis or occlusion of the basilar or intracranial vertebral arteries identified on vascular imaging before undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Clinical and radiographic features were reviewed, along with the nature of the surgeries and details of the perioperative management. Records were reviewed for the diagnosis of stroke occurring within 1 month of surgery. Thirty-eight patients with a history of symptomatic vertebrobasilar ischemia underwent 50 operations under general anesthesia, and 3 had ischemic strokes in the vertebrobasilar territory immediately after surgery, a per-procedure rate of 6.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 16.6) All 3 had episodes of prolonged hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg for >10 minutes) during surgery.

He was diagnosed with spontaneous dissection of both vertebral arteries, with occlusion of the right one, and the right carotid artery. Neurological examination also revealed a right C2-C3 tactile sensory loss, with unilateral proprioceptive deficit below. Brain images revealed small bilateral cerebellar infarcts which could not be responsible for the clinical symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord showed a right posterior cervical spinal cord infarction. The patient achieved nearly complete recovery after several weeks of anticoagulation and rehabilitation. Infarction of the caudal portion of the cervical spinal cord, especially unilateral, caused by spontaneous VAD, has rarely been described and is certainly under-diagnosed due to less suggestive symptoms, like unilateral and mainly sensory deficit.

Here, we describe a case of endovascular treatment of a ruptured occipital artery aneurysm that occurred after a craniotomy in a patient with NF1. A 46-year-old man with a history of NF1 underwent a right lateral suboccipital craniotomy to remove a cavernous hemangioma in the right middle cerebellar peduncle. Severe bleeding occurred in the occipital artery during the craniotomy. Due to vessel fragility, coagulation and ligation were not possible, and pressure hemostasis was achieved using cellulose oxide and fibrin glue. On postoperative day 12, the patient developed a sudden swelling on the right side of the neck as well as tracheal compression. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a ruptured aneurysm in the right occipital artery. Transarterial embolization was performed under general anesthesia the same day. Right external carotid angiography showed an 18-mm-diameter fusiform aneurysm in the occipital artery. The aneurysm ruptured inferiorly to form a large pseudoaneurysm with significant jet flow. An arteriovenous fistula was also observed in a nearby vein. A microcatheter was inserted into the fusiform aneurysm under proximal blood flow control, and embolization was performed using coils and <i>N</i>-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. Compared to surgical repair of ruptured occipital artery aneurysms, endovascular treatment appears to be safe, effective, minimally invasive, and rapid.

On admission, high levels of arterial hypertension were found. It seems that trigeminal manipulation during dental treatment as well as increased serum levels of induced epinephrine mainly by stress and pain, and the small amounts absorbed from the site of local anesthesia might produce abrupt elevation of blood pressure, subsequent increase in cerebral blood flow and severe, even fatal intracerebral hemorrhage.

In children, this method has been reported extraoperatively by the placement of invasive electrodes to map the language area and monitor epileptic activity. It is difficult from a technical standpoint to perform an awake craniotomy and language mapping in young children under 10 years of age. Here we report a 9-year-old boy suffering from drug-resistant non-lesional epilepsy who underwent extraoperative and intraoperative electrical stimulation with successful identification of Broca's language area. Electrocorticography (ECOG) was applied intraoperatively in a continuous manner utilizing grid electrodes before the skin opening. We found that the use of visual digital video games facilitated extraoperative and intraoperative cortical mapping. Cortical language inhibition by electrical stimulation was elicited at an amplitude of 7 mA (100 μs single-phase duration and 50 Hz pulse width). Resection of the seizure onset zone was completed safely. The post-resection ECOG revealed the disappearance of epileptogenic electrographic discharges at the seizure onset contacts and at other involved contacts in the epileptogenic zone. After surgery, the child recovered well with no language deficits and remained seizure-free. The child remembered only the video game test that was performed intraoperatively.

We retrospectively report the unexpected clinical outcome of these two patients in relation with the anatomical damages documented by brain MRI, associated with diffusion tensor imaging and reconstruction of corticospinal tracts in tractography. The following clinical parameters systematically assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months: muscle testing on 12 key muscles (Medical Research Council), prehension metrics (box and block test and purdue pegboard), and independence for acts of daily living (functional independence measure). Both patients showed a progressive recovery beginning between 2 and 3 months after the onset of symptoms, leading to almost complete autonomy at 12 months (FIM > 110), with motor strength greater than 4/5 in all joint segments (MRC > 50/60). On brain MRI with tractography, CST appeared partially preserved at pons level. The possibility of a near-complete functional recovery at 12 months is important to consider given the ethical issues at stake and the discussions about limiting care that may take place initially. It seems to be the consequence of reversible myelin damage combined with partially preserved neurons. Development of collateral pathways or resolution of conduction block may explain this recovery. MRI comprising DTI and tractography could play a key role in the prognosis of motor recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Annals of clinical and translational neurology,10.1002/acn3.51994,PMC10963307,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report a novel application of the NIM® nerve monitoring system (Medtronic@ NIM response 3.0) for intraoperative direct cortical (dc)-MEPs monitoring. A 69-year-old female patient presented with a 4month history of progressive left hemiparesis resulting from a large right sided posterior frontal meningioma that abutted and compressed the motor cortex. Motor cortical mapping and MEPs were indicated. The patient was anesthetized and maintained on total intravenous anesthetics. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) of the right upper limb were monitored using the NIM system. After a craniotomy was performed, we first used the Ojemann stimulator (monopolar) for dc-stimulation and then switched to use the monopolar nerve stimulator probe of the NIM system. The CMAP response was successfully elicited using the NIM stimulating probe (pulse width=250s, train frequency=7pulses/s, current=20mA). A gross total resection of the tumor was achieved with intermittent cortical mapping of MEPs. There were no intraoperative complications and the patient's motor function was preserved after the surgery. In this case, we reported the successful use of the NIM nerve monitoring system to elicit dc-MEPs under general anesthesia. The advantages of using this system include a simple set up and application, neurosurgeon familiarity, wide availability and lower cost. dc-MEPs can be achieved using the NIM system. We conclude that the NIM nerve monitoring system is a feasible alternative to standard neurophysiological monitoring systems.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2016.11.006,,Cortical mapping; Evoked potential monitoring; Motor evoked potentials; NIM system,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

A 68-year-old female patient developed sudden HL in the right ear and vertigo. A left-beating horizontal torsional nystagmus was observed, and caloric weakness in the right side was noted. Diffusion- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar infarction in the right AICA territory.

27001236,Ipsilateral Dural Thickening and Enhancement: A Sign of Isolated Cortical Vein Thrombosis? A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Croci, Davide Marco; Michael, Diepers; Kahles, Timo; Fathi, Ali-Reza; Fandino, Javier; Marbacher, Serge",Croci,"Isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT) being a rare condition (6% of intracranial vein thromboses), no clinical guidelines and few radiologic clues to it have been established. ICVT mostly appears in conjunction with sinus vein thromboses. ICVTs primarily occur during pregnancy and puerperium (35%). The great variability of cortical veins and difficulty identifying small occluded vessels complicate ICVT diagnosis. We present the first case of isolated ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement as a potential radiologic sign of ICVT shown on magnetic resonance imaging. A 30-year-old woman presented with sudden position-independent severe headache and neck pain 2 weeks postpartum. Standard magnetic resonance imaging revealed ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement of the meninges (left hemisphere). The symptoms and findings were interpreted as a post-lumbar puncture syndrome associated with the epidural anesthesia during labor and birth. Deteriorating, the patient was referred to our hospital after a computed tomography scan had revealed atypical left parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Digital cerebral subtraction angiography confirmed a left parietal ICVT as the underlying disease. When systemic anticoagulation was initiated, the patient's condition further deteriorated. Progressive aphasia and right-sided face and arm weakness and numbness developed as a result of increased intracranial hemorrhage volume. We therefore performed craniotomy and hematoma evacuation, after which the patient fully recovered. We hypothesize that ipsilateral dural thickening and enhancement in patients presenting with severe headache may indicate ICVT and we suggest further diagnostic workup, using venographic study such as computed tomographic venography or magnetic resonance venography. In an inconclusive venographic study with high clinical suspicion for ICVT, catheter cerebral angiography is indicated.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.03.026,,Ipsilateral dural thickening; Isolated cortical vein thrombosis; Magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

In patients undergoing neuro-anesthesia for surgical procedure evacuation of intracerebral hemorrhage with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, anticoagulants should not be given because they can cause recurrent bleeding. Meanwhile, at the same time, the patient could also be infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one of treatment is the administration of anticoagulants. A case report. A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a loss of consciousness and was diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage due to a hemorrhagic stroke and was confirmed positive for COVID-19. Giving anticoagulants to patients is considered counterproductive so, an ethical dilemma arises. For this reason, a joint conference was held to obtain the best ethical and medicolegal solutions for the patient. By using several methods of resolving ethical dilemmas such as basic ethical principles, supporting ethical principles, and medicolegal considerations, it was decided that the patient was not to be given anticoagulants. Giving anticoagulants to hemorrhagic stroke patients is dangerous even though it is beneficial for COVID-19 patients, so here the principle of risk-benefit balance is applied to patients who prioritize risk prevention rather than providing benefits. This is also supported by the <i>prima facie</i> principle by prioritizing the principle of non-maleficence rather than beneficence, the <i>minus malum</i> principle by seeking the lowest risk, and the double effect principle by making the best decision even in a slightly less favorable way as well as the medicolegal aspect by assessing patient safety and risk management.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,F1000Research,10.12688/f1000research.75630.2,PMC10739180,Anticoagulants; COVID-19; Ethics and medicolegal; Hemorrhagic stroke; Neuro-anesthesia,Case Reports,England,eng
1735870,Acute postoperative hypertension in the hypertensive patient.,"Hogenson, K D",Hogenson,"Acute postoperative hypertension (APH) has been documented in the PACU. Over half of the patients who exhibit APH have pre-existing primary hypertension. Sustained blood pressure (BP) elevation increases the risk of myocardial ischemia, infarction, surgical site bleeding, or cerebral hemorrhage in these patients. Following surgery and anesthesia, increased sympathetic stimulation caused by a high level of circulating catecholamines can lead to APH. Some direct perioperative stimulants include pain, anxiety, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, shivering, volume overload, and bladder distension. Nursing interventions are directed toward identifying and relieving the cause of APH. Antihypertensive drug therapy with vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors is used if initial nursing interventions are not effective. Vasodilators frequently used are hydralazine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin. Nicardipine has recently been introduced as an intravenous calcium channel blocker. Vasodilators are effective in BP reduction but may cause reflex tachycardia when used alone. Adrenergic inhibitors, such as esmolol and labetalol, block alpha and/or beta receptors to decrease heart rate and BP. Labetalol's effectiveness, relative freedom from side effects, and ease of administration have made it a useful drug in the treatment of APH.",{},,Journal of post anesthesia nursing,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Recanalization of thrombi inside pseudoaneurysmal sac is one of the putative mechanisms of rebleeding of unsecured aneurysms and of coil migration after endovascular treatment. We document ""real time"" pseudoaneurysm formation after rerupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Case report. A 55-year-old man with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from an anterior communicating aneurysm underwent catheter angiography. After the diagnostic angiogram while awaiting for the anesthesia team to proceed with endotracheal general anesthesia, a seizure occurred. Rebleeding was suspected and confirmed by a dynamic CT in the angio suite. A repeat angiogram showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the previously ruptured aneurysm which had not been present on the original angiogram a few minutes earlier. Uneventful coiling of the aneurysm was undertaken and the patient was discharged home a week later. We document angiographic formation of a ""pseudoaneurysm"" at the site of rupture of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. ""Pseudoaneurysm"" formation occurs after rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. They represent a weak spot in the aneurysm sac at the site of rupture and probably the result of persistent flow within the clot forming at the site of rupture.

Awake craniotomies with intraoperative cortical and subcortical mapping have helped to achieve this aim while allowing us to preserve executive function including language. Language mapping becomes a daunting task in individuals who are bilingual because of the complexity of varied cortical representation of different languages. We present a case of a bilingual patient who underwent re-resection of right frontal astrocytoma using principles of awake surgery and language mapping. Our patient was fluent in English and Hindi. She underwent a complete neurophysiologic cognitive assessment in both languages preoperatively. She was tested for speech arrest, nominal aphasia, and semantic paraphasia intraoperatively for both English and Hindi. She underwent a gross total resection with postoperative preservation of both English and Hindi. Intraoperative language mapping revealed that while certain cortical areas overlapped between 2 languages, other aspects were represented by distinct areas. Postoperative assessment at 2 months revealed most major aspects of language remained preserved or had improved relative to the preoperative baseline. Advancements in anesthesia and neuromonitoring have further allowed for long awake periods, permitting complex language tasks to be tested intraoperatively. The results obtained from this case study have allowed us to further plan for awake surgeries for patients with bilingualism. With understanding bilingual representation of languages, we hope to achieve maximal resection with minimal postoperative deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.01.153,,Awake surgeries; Gliomas; Language mapping; Neuronal plasticity,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Arterial blood pressure was overall well maintained except for a very transient hypotension at surgical incision. Blood loss was moderate and did not require transfusion. Soon after recovery, the patient complained of paresthesia in both legs and neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb hypoesthesia, compatible with an incomplete medullar syndrome at the level of T12-L1. On postoperative day one, a plain magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated a hyperintense signal in the spinal cord from T8 to T9 on T2-weighted images consistent with ischemia of the spinal cord whereas the heterogeneous aspect of the spinal cord was due to an unusually high fat content of the epidural space. Neurological signs improved progressively and one week later the patient had recovered normal sensory functions of both lower limbs. Although arterial ischemia is the most common cause of postoperative spinal cord injury, other mechanisms may be invoked. We raise the possibility that a combination of intraoperative risk factors (hypotension, excessive postural changes) with anatomic predispositions (increased epidural venous pressure or fat content, previous bone disease) can produce arterial and/or venous ischemia of the spinal cord.",{},,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,10.1007/BF03018706,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Mild hypoesthesia was observed on his left limbs. No speech disturbance, facial palsy, or neck or shoulder pain was observed. Intravenous thrombolytic treatment was given 238 min after symptom onset. Brown-Sequard syndrome subsequently developed 6 h after thrombolysis with a hypoesthetic sensory level below the right C5 dermatome.

However, tumors with a large caudal extension below the internal auditory meatus typically cannot be adequately accessed with this approach and the posterior petrosal approach is utilized.2 Specific venous anatomy might deter from cutting the tentorium. This article describes the surgical resection of a trigeminal schwannoma with a large posterior fossa component through a petrosal approach without cutting the tentorium.4 The patient is a 34-yr-old man who presented with headaches and gait disturbance. Neurological exam revealed hypoesthesia and hypoalgesia in the left V1 and V2 distributions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large dumbbell-shaped schwannoma causing brainstem compression. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) demonstrated temporal lobe venous drainage into the superior petrosal sinus and tentorium proximal to the transverse sigmoid junction. A single temporal-suboccipital bone flap and a retro-labrynthine mastoidectomy were performed. The petrous apex was drilled and Meckle's cave opened. The presigmoid dura was opened and extended toward the petrous apex region beneath the tentorium. This provided access to and safe resection of the tumor. A gross total tumor resection was achieved.

The patient was a 71-year-old male presenting with three large intracranial lesions and an underlying primary renal cell carcinoma malignancy. Because of a severe kyphotic deformity resulting from ankylosing spondylitis, the patient was placed in a moderate Trendelenburg position to allow his head to fit into the gamma knife unit during the radiosurgery session. The two left-sided lesions were to be treated with 20 Gy to the 50% isodose line, and the right-sided lesion with 16 Gy to the 40% isodose line. Anesthesia was available throughout the treatment session to aid with pain control. The gamma knife treatment was aborted because the patient suffered a generalized seizure while in the unit.

33663119,Carbon dioxide: the cause of devastating stroke without hemodynamic compromise during laparoscopic nephrectomy with injury of the inferior vena cava: A case report.,"Yao, Youxiu; Xu, Mao",Yao,"Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic surgery can bring about occult perioperative cerebral infarction, advancing our understanding of the causes of severe postoperative delayed recovery. Here, we report the case of a 35-year-old woman who underwent a right renal tumor resection in our institution, during which a raised pneumoperitoneum pressure (from 15 to 20 mm Hg) was adopted by the surgeon to prevent errhysis and to help stop the bleeding. Despite an accidental minor tearing of the inferior vena cava, vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure, and no obvious abnormality was observed in either end tidal carbon dioxide values or blood gas analysis. However, the patient unexpectedly suffered delayed recovery after the operation, presenting incomplete left hemiplegia and a positive Babinski sign. Perioperative stroke was diagnosed by anesthesiologists, after excluding the effects of anesthesia. Cerebral hemorrhage was excluded, as no obvious abnormality was found in the density of brain parenchyma in the emergency computed tomography examination, and a digital subtraction angiography showed no abnormal thrombosis. Further magnetic resonance diagnosis led us to consider diffuse gas embolisms to be the cause of this acute stroke; a right echocardiography revealed that a patent foramen ovale (PFO) may account for the global cerebral gas embolisms. The patient received neuroprotective drugs (Vinpocetine, Edaravone, and Xingnaojing, which are commonly used as a standard of care in China), antiplatelets and other symptomatic treatments, plus dexamethasone to relieve edema. A contrast-enhanced echocardiography of the right heart was performed, the results of which were consistent with the sonography of a PFO. The patient was hospitalized for 14 days and eventually discharged after recovery. At the latest follow-up in August 2019, the patient recovered without residual neurological sequelae. Our results emphasize the need for vigilance regarding adverse cardiovascular and neurological events caused by carbon dioxide gas embolisms when encountering the inadvertent situation of vessels rupturing. Timely monitoring of paradoxical gas embolism by transoesophageal echocardiography is necessary and can avert the risk of severe complications. Urgent consideration should be given to stopping pneumoperitoneum and switching to laparotomy for hemostasis so that the patient can obtain the best benefit-risk ratio.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000024892,PMC7909101,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Neurologic findings consisted of myelopathy affecting the lumbar intumescence (1 dog) and T3-L3 myelopathy (2 dogs). In all dogs, MRI revealed spinal cord compression caused by L3-4 disk herniation. All dogs underwent routine surgical decompression of the intervertebral disk herniation. During MRI and decompressive surgery, physiologic variables were monitored. Immediately after surgery, all dogs were paraplegic with pelvic limb neurologic dysfunction consistent with myelopathy affecting the L4 through caudal spinal cord segments. Within 24 hours after surgery, repeated MRI in all dogs revealed hyperintensity in the spinal cord gray matter of the lumbar intumescence on T2-weighted images. In the absence of neurologic improvement, dogs were euthanized at 3, 91, and 34 days after surgery. Postmortem microscopic examination of each dog's spinal cord at the lumbar intumescence revealed necrosis of the gray matter with relative white matter preservation suggestive of an ischemic injury. Dramatic neurologic deterioration following decompressive surgery for intervertebral disk herniation in dogs may be associated with the development of poliomyelomalacia secondary to ischemia. In these 3 dogs, ischemia developed despite probable maintenance of normal spinal cord blood flow and perfusion during anesthesia. To exclude other causes, such as compression or hemorrhage, MRI was repeated and revealed hyperintensity of the spinal cord gray matter on T2-weighted images, which microscopically corresponded with ischemic neurons and neuronal loss.",{},,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,10.2460/javma.257.4.397,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
26459699,Perioperative Bioccipital Watershed Strokes in Bilateral Fetal Posterior Cerebral Arteries During Spinal Surgery.,"Mione, Gioia; Pische, Guillaume; Wolff, Valérie; Tonnelet, Romain; Humbertjean, Lisa; Richard, Sébastien",Mione,"Vision loss due to cerebral infarction during spinal surgery is less described. Intraoperative hypotension would be a leading cause. Patients with variation of the circle of Willis could be more prone to present stroke in this context, but reports are lacking to sustain the theory. Bilateral occipital watershed ischemic strokes have never been described before. We report the case of a patient with a fetal origin of both posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs), presenting this particular anatomic stroke following lumbar laminectomy surgery for spinal stenosis during which intraoperative hypotension was observed. We discuss how this common anomaly associated with intraoperative hypotension could have promoted this serious complication. A 55-year-old man woke up with cortical blindness after he had undergone lumbar surgery during which a marked decrease in blood pressure had occurred. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral symmetric infarctions of the occipital lobes in the distal territory of both PCAs and smaller anterior watershed ischemic strokes, suggesting a hemodynamic mechanism. Extended investigations, including conventional angiography, failed to find any cause of stroke but revealed bilateral fetal PCAs supplied by internal carotid arteries only. Two years later, the patient has not recovered and remains severely visually impaired. The standing hypothesis would be posterior low-flow infarctions resulting from intraoperative hypotension on a variation of the circle of Willis more prone to decrease in cerebral blood flow. Moreover, this case supports the hypothesis of vascular insufficiency due to intraoperative hypotension as cause of stroke during spinal surgery.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.09.098,,Cerebral watershed infarction; Circle of Willis; Intraoperative hypotension; Perioperative stroke; Posterior cerebral artery; Spinal surgery; Vision loss,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Unifocal large vessel infarcts may follow zoster in the trigeminal or cervical distribution as a result of transaxonal transport of virus from trigeminal or cervical afferent fibers that innervate vessels. Ophthalmic zoster (HZO) might cause ophthalmoplegic syndromes, with secondary optic neuritis. Mechanisms include local orbital muscle inflammation and, viral spread from the ophthalmic branch of the fifth nerve with associated vasculopathy. A 72-year-old man developed a vesicular rash in the territory of C5-T5-6. Within four weeks, the patient developed headache, dysphagia, left facial and extremity ataxic weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right pontine infarction. A 66-year-old woman presented with right-sided painfull HZO. One week later she developed complete external ophthalmoplegia and blurred vision. MRI showed ill-defined signal alteration in the retrobulbar tissue. Three weeks later, the patient was admitted because of dysarthria, deviated tongue, left-sided limb weakness, and tactile hypoesthesia. Spinal fluid contained 23 lymphocytes/mm3 and increased protein. The serum contained antibodies to VZV IgG and IgM in both cases. The patients received intravenously acyclovir with improvement.

A few hours later, upbeat nystagmus and dysarthria appeared along with a sensory disturbance that spread to all extremities, and right hemiparesis progressed to tetraplegia. Brain MR diffusion-weighted images revealed a high-intensity lesion in the bilateral medial medulla oblongata and we diagnosed this bilateral medial medullary infarction. Three dimentional CT angiography revealed dissection of the right VA. We administered intravenous argatroban, edaravone, glycerin and oral clopidogrel. He was assessed as having modified Rankin scale 4 and was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on day 30.

20838839,The extended retrosigmoid approach for neoplastic lesions in the posterior fossa: technique modification.,"Raza, Shaan M; Quinones-Hinojosa, Alfredo",Raza,"Approaches to the cerebellar-pontine angle and petroclival region can be challenging due to intervening eloquent neurovascular structures and cerebellar retraction required to view this anatomic compartment with the standard retrosigmoid technique. As previously described [11], the extended retrosigmoid provides additional access to space ventral to the brainstem through mobilization of the sigmoid sinus. We report our further experience and modifications of this approach for neoplastic pathology. The standard craniotomy is utilized, and the burr holes are placed slightly beyond the transverse sinus as well as the transverse-sigmoid junction and down towards the foramen magnum, as low as possible. Another burr hole is placed over the cerebral hemisphere to facilitate the dural dissection below the bone flap and over the transverse and sigmoid sinuses. We then perform a standard retrosigmoid craniotomy with a craniotome and the transverse and sigmoid sinuses are skeletonized. Consequently, the sigmoid sinus can then mobilized anteriorly to provide an unobstructed view in line with the petrous bone, while exposure of the transverse sinus provides access to the tentorium. Fifteen patients (March 2006-July 2008) underwent this approach to manage neoplastic lesions, including five meningiomas, three schwannomas, one epidermoid, and four intra-axial metastatic lesions. The nine extra-axial lesions were predominantly in the cerebellar-pontine angle with extension medial to the seventh/eighth nerve complex to the petroclival region. Gross total resection was obtained in all patients. The primary complication due to the exposure was a clinically asymptomatic sigmoid sinus thrombosis in one patient. Requiring a fundamental change in the management of the venous sinuses, the extended retrosigmoid craniotomy permits mobilization of the sigmoid and transverse sinuses. In this process, the entire cerebellar-pontine angle extending from the tentorium to the foramen magnum can be visualized with minimal cerebellar retraction. This technical modification over the standard retrosigmoid approach may provide a useful advantage to neurosurgeons dealing with these complex lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-010-0284-3,PMC4612613,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
30408608,Monitoring Corticocortical Evoked Potentials During Intracranial Vascular Surgery.,"Yoshimoto, Tetsuyuki; Maruichi, Katsuhiko; Itoh, Yasuhiro; Takamiya, Soichiro; Kaneko, Tetsuya",Yoshimoto,"Monitoring of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) during brain tumor surgery of patients under anesthesia was recently reported to be effective in assisting in preservation of speech function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CCEPs can be reproducibly measured between the frontal and temporal lobes during standard intracranial vascular surgery under general anesthesia; whether dynamic changes in CCEPs caused by reduced focal cerebral blood flow can be measured; and whether CCEPs can be used to monitor speech function, particularly associated with the left side of the brain. We monitored CCEPs during 58 vascular surgeries (42 clipping procedures; 15 bypasses, 1 of which overlapped with clipping; and 2 hematoma removals from the left frontal and temporal lobe) at Kashiwaba Neurosurgical Hospital from October 2016 to January 2018. CCEPs could be reproducibly and routinely monitored in bilateral vascular surgeries. None of the patients experienced any postoperative symptoms or showed any ischemic lesions on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging; however, 5 patients temporarily demonstrated reduced CCEPs intraoperatively that were caused by transient obstructions of blood flow. Motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials were simultaneously monitored intraoperatively and did not show any changes. The results of our pilot study show that CCEPs can be routinely monitored during bilateral intracranial vascular surgery and that they are sensitive to ischemia. CCEPs on the left side could serve as unique intraoperative monitoring of speech function under anesthesia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.10.179,,Bypass; CCEP; Clipping; Ischemia; Speech function,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Recently, he consumed the liquid-like herbal product called shengmai-yin (10 mL daily) against medical advice. Seven days after the daily consumption of shengmai-yin, he was admitted to the intensive care unit because of consciousness disturbance [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 7] with an INR of 5.08. Head computed topography revealed intracerebral hematoma in the left temporoparietal region. Both warfarin therapy and the herbal product were withdrawn. At the same time, therapy with intravenous vitamin K1 40 mg was started. On the second day of admission, craniectomy was performed to remove the intacerebral hematoma under general anesthesia. He remained confused and restless for 2 days, but then showed progressive recovery in the consciousness level as well as motor and verbal functions. Shengmai-yin contains herbal ingredients that can interact with warfarin.

It allowed maximum tumor resection while avoiding neurological morbidity. However, this technique presents several challenges to both the neurosurgeon and anesthesiologist. In this case, we present a 33-year-old male who was diagnosed with low-grade glioma in the left parieto-occipital, which required surgical resection. Anatomically, the tumor was located in the language area. Hence, it was decided to perform an awake craniotomy excision of the tumor to allow intraoperative cortical mapping to preserve language functions. Intraoperative, a subdural hematoma was noted, and severe pain occurred. Eventually, this leads to an upward herniation of the brain parenchyma. The crisis was addressed promptly with maneuvers to decrease intracranial pressure. Awake craniotomy was abandoned, and the procedure was converted to general anesthesia without the benefit of intraoperative cortical mapping. It is important to note that complications may arise during the procedure, leading to significant harm and debilitation for the patient.

Hearing was preserved. Preoperative images showed a 5.5 cm multilobulated enhancing extra-axial mass centered in the left petroclival region with extension into middle and posterior fossa causing severe (Stage 3) brainstem compression.<sup>[1]</sup> After a lengthy discussion of treatment options, the patient consented for the procedure. We performed a presigmoid retrolabyrinthine combined petrosal approach. We used cranial nerves monitoring (VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII), frameless stereotaxy, and a lumbar drain. Due to the tumor size and location (petroclival region with extension into the posterior and middle cranial fossa), we chose this approach to achieve a maximal safe resection of the tumor and preserve hearing. Alternative approaches of use are expanded middle fossa with transcavernous extension or expanded endonasal approach. The selected approach achieved wide exposure of the tumor which was highly vascular. The tumor was carefully dissected off the brainstem, cranial nerves (IV, V, VI, VII, VIII), and basilar artery trunk. A gross total resection was achieved (Multimedia 1). The patient did well after surgery and was extubated on postoperative day (POD) 1 and the lumbar drain removed on POD 5. Pathology reported low-grade chondrosarcoma (WHO grade I).

Petroclival chondrosarcomas are rare tumors that are usually treated with surgical resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery. The tumor size, location, and extension dictate approach selection.

32664871,Relationship between the temporal course of astrogliosis and symptom improvement in cerebral infarction: report of a case monitored using <sup>18</sup>F-THK5351 positron emission tomography.,"Ishibashi, Kenji; Miura, Yoshiharu; Hirata, Kosei; Toyohara, Jun; Ishii, Kenji",Ishibashi,"<sup>18</sup>F-THK5351 was recently shown to bind to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) with high affinity. MAO-B is highly concentrated in astrocytes and increases during astrogliosis. Therefore, <sup>18</sup>F-THK5351 accumulates in lesions undergoing astrogliosis. Cerebral infarction causes astrogliosis, which may be beneficial for repairing and regenerating injured cells and tissues in the lesions. Therefore, monitoring the degree of astrogliosis and stroke symptoms is essential for understanding the roles of astrogliosis in cerebral infarction. A 72-year-old man, complaining of total loss of sensation in the left index finger, was diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction, and underwent <sup>18</sup>F-THK5351 positron emission tomography (PET) on two occasions after the stroke. The first PET scan performed on day 27 revealed intense uptake in the infarct lesion located around the right precentral and postcentral gyri.

This phenomenon, termed normal perfusion pressure breakthrough by Spetzler et al., is caused by the diversion of blood flow from the AVM into adjacent, maximally dilated, and nonautoregulating small vessels. We recently encountered three cases of cerebral AVM that exhibited breakthrough bleeding immediately after an apparently successful operation. In all cases, the surgeon was unable to control the resultant hemorrhage by standard microsurgical techniques. High dose barbiturate anesthesia, combined with blood pressure reduction to the lower levels of the normal cerebral perfusion curve, was then initiated in each case. Controlled hyperventilation, steroids, and osmotic dehydrating agents were also used to control intracranial pressure elevation. After maintenance of this regimen for several days, the patients were returned to the operating room for hematoma evacuation. At this time, bleeding was controlled easily and breakthrough did not occur. Although this regimen requires intensive anesthetic, pulmonary, and cerebral monitoring, it successfully salvaged all three patients.

The ultrasound device was used to select the trajectory and target point for hematoma drainage. Ultrasound-guided aspiration was performed via a burr hole under local anesthesia. We used a temporal burr hole entry point rather than the more frequently used pre-coronal approach. The burr hole was positioned 4 to 6 cm behind the posterior border of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone and 4 to 5 cm above the external auditory meatus. The hematoma was then evacuated with urokinase irrigation. Ultrasound guidance allows simple, precise localization of the hematoma and the distance from the surface to the target can be calculated.

Here, we report a case of contrast extravasation mimicking intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with intraventricular extension after intravenous thrombolytic treatment and computed tomography angiography (CTA). A 52-year-old man presented with right-sided hemiparesis and hypoesthesia. Initial non-contrast head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and acute ischemic changes. He received intravenous treatment with tenecteplase 3.8 h after the onset of stroke. CTA of the head and neck was performed at 4.3 h after stroke onset. It showed no stenosis or occlusion of the carotid and major intracranial arteries. At about 1.5 h after CTA, the right-sided hemiparesis deteriorated, accompanied by drowsiness, aphasia, and urinary incontinence. Immediate head CT showed hyperdense lesions with mild space-occupying effect in the left basal ganglia and both lateral ventricles. The hyperdense lesions were reduced in size on follow-up CT after 5 h. Two days later, CT showed that the hyperdense lesions in the lateral ventricles almost completely disappeared and only a small amount remained in the infarcted area. Contrast extravasation into the brain tissue and lateral ventricles, mimicking ICH with intraventricular extension, could occur after intravenous thrombolytic treatment and CTA in a patient with AIS, which might lead to misdiagnosis and wrong treatment of the patient. The rapid resolution of intracranial hyperdense lesions is key to differentiate contrast extravasation from ICH on serial non-enhanced CT.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-024-03618-y,PMC11027420,Computed tomography; Contrast media; Intracranial hemorrhage; Intravenous thrombolytics,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a left frontal AVM. After a short hospital stay for stabilization and diagnosis, the final medical decision was to maintain the pregnancy and a multidisciplinary follow-up by neurosurgery and high-risk obstetric consultation. An elective cesarean section was performed at 39 weeks under epidural anesthesia. During the intraoperative period, an episode of hypotension rapidly reversed with phenylephrine occurred. The newborn Apgar score was 10/10. An epidural catheter was used for postoperative analgesia, also uneventful. There are very few published cases of anesthetic approach for pregnant women with symptomatic AVM.

On emergence from the barbiturates, the patient demonstrated elevated intracranial pressure and resolving deficits. She was discharged 3 weeks after surgery for rehabilitation. Arteriovenous malformations can compromise the cerebral parenchyma by mass effect, by hemorrhage, and by ""stealing"" blood from adjacent tissue. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can result in sympathetic stimulation, hydrocephalus, meningeal irritation, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and cerebral vasospasm. Excision may result in massive cerebral hemorrhage and edema as arterial pressures are abruptly normalized. Anesthetic management is guided by a full evaluation of the patient's pathophysiology and medical management. The anesthetist must understand the total impact of the AVM, compensatory responses, and the hazard of surgery and anesthesia. The goal is to achieve a balance in oxygen supply and demand at a pressure sufficient to perfuse the brain tissue without exceeding the pressure limits of compromised vasculature.

Preoperatively, all patients had undergone a detailed neuropsychological examination. In 10 patients aphasic disturbances could be detected. All patients underwent preoperative PET studies (methionine and (15)O-labeled water with activation during speech or finger tapping). These were performed and co-registered with MRI data to demonstrate the topographical relationship between motor or language function and the tumor borders. Anesthesia was induced with i.v. administration of propofol (150-250 mg/h). Craniotomy was performed under local infiltration anesthesia. After opening of the dura, sedation was stopped and operation was continued with the patient being alert and co-operative. With close clinical observation during electrical cortex stimulation, a speech arrest could be triggered or avoided. The motor cortex was identified by recording the phase reversal of the contralateral SEP of the median nerve and by direct cortical stimulation. As soon as aphasic or motor disturbances appeared, the tumor removal was continued with the goal of avoiding these specific regions. In 27 patients, preexisting neuropsychological and neurological deficits did not worsen. Only one patient was left postoperatively with a major permanent aphasic deficit that was present preoperatively to a minor degree. The use of local anesthesia in craniotomy for surgery of intrinsic cerebral neoplasms in eloquent areas allows for a continuous and repetitive monitoring of speech and motor function during the removal of even those tumors that were previously considered inoperable.",{},,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,10.1055/s-2000-11372,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Our objective is to study functional areas involved in writing network, based on the observations of different postoperative writing disorders in a population of patients without preoperative agraphia. We analyzed the postoperative agraphia profiles in 15 patients who underwent surgery for cerebral LGGs in functional language areas, using electrical mapping under local anesthesia. These profiles were then correlated to the sites of the lesions, shown by preoperative cerebral imaging. Our findings showed that (1) spoken language and writing functions could be dissociated, and that (2) writing is subserved, at least partially, by a network of 5 areas located in the dominant hemisphere for language: the superior parietal region, the supramarginalis gyrus, the second and third frontal convolutions, the supplementary motor area, and the insula. Each of these areas seems to have a different role in writing, which will be detailed in this article. However, among the patients, only those with lesions of the supplementary motor area did not recover from agraphia in the postoperative period (in 50% of cases). On the basis of these results, and in the light of the recent literature, we discuss the relevance of each area in this anatomo-functional network as well as the clinical implications of such better knowledge of the neural basis of writing, especially for brain surgery and functional rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2008.10.074,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Disconnection syndrome, hemiparesis, hemianesthesia, or aphasia is not uncommon after such surgery, especially when lesion is large. By contrast, the transsulcal parafascicular approach uses naturally existing corridors and a tubular retractor to minimize brain injury. A retrospective review of patients undergoing minimally invasive transsulcal parafascicular resection of ventricular and periventricular lesions, across 5 independent centers, was conducted. Twenty patients with lesions located in the lateral ventricle (n = 9), the third ventricle (n = 6) and periventricular region (n = 4) are described in this report. Average age was 64 years (8 male/12 female). The average depth from cortical surface was 4.37 cm. A 13.5-mm-diameter tubular retractor (BrainPath [NICO Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA]) of differing lengths was used, aided by neuronavigation. Gross total resection was obtained in 17 patients. Pathologies included colloid cyst, subependymoma, glioma, meningioma, central neurocytoma, lymphoma, and metastasis. Three patients experienced transient morbidity: memory loss (2), hemiparesis (1). One patient died 3 months postoperatively as a result of unrelated pulmonary illness. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 27 months (average, 12 months). This technique is safe and effective for the treatment of intraventricular and periventricular lesions.

28293537,A rare case of concomitant sicca keratopathy and ipsilateral central facial palsy in Wallenberg's dorsolateral medullary syndrome.,"De Bruyn, Deborah; Van Aken, Elisabeth; Herman, Kristien",De Bruyn,"<b>Objective:</b> To describe a patient with a right-sided supranuclear facial palsy and concomitant sicca keratopathy of the right eye following right-sided dorsolateral medullary infarction. <b>Methods:</b> Our patient underwent a complete ophthalmologic and neurologic examination including biomicroscopy, fundus examination, cranial nerve examination, Shirmer I test, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. <b>Results:</b> A 61-year-old woman presented in emergency with a central facial nerve palsy on the right side and truncal ataxia. Neurologic assessment revealed a concurrent dysphagia, dysarthria, hypoesthesia of the right face, and weakness of the right upper limb. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an old left-sided cerebellar infarction, but a recent ischemic infarction at the level of the right dorsolateral medulla oblongata was the cause of our patient's current problems. One month after diagnosis of the right-sided dorsolateral medullary syndrome, there were complaints of ocular irritation and a diminished visual acuity in the right eye. Biomicroscopy showed a sicca keratopathy with nearly complete absence of tear secretion on the Shirmer I test, but with normal eye closure and preserved corneal reflexes and sensitivity. <b>Conclusion:</b> A dorsolateral medullary syndrome can have a variable expression in symptomatology. Our case is special because of the combination of an ipsilateral supranuclear facial palsy with normal upper facial muscle function together with an ipsilateral sicca keratopathy as a result of a nearly absent tear secretion. We hypothesized that the mechanism underlying the patient's sicca keratopathy ipsilateral to the supranuclear facial palsy involved the superior salivatory nucleus, which is situated in the caudal pons inferiorly of the motor facial nucleus and is most probably affected by a superior extension of the infarcted area in the right medulla oblongata.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,GMS ophthalmology cases,10.3205/oc000059,PMC5343209,Wallenberg’s syndrome; central facial palsy; dorsolateral medullary infarction; medulla oblongata; sicca keratopathy; subclavian steal syndrome; superior salivatory nucleus; supranuclear facial palsy,Case Reports,Germany,eng

Currently, investigations have only been made to compare general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (GA) versus conscious sedation (CS), and results are still a matter of debate. We present the case of a 79-year-old man that developed an AIS because of occlusion of the M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery who was successfully managed with a general anesthesia with supraglottic airway device (GA-SAD) during EMT.

A 19-year-old woman, who was also 35 weeks pregnant, was admitted to our hospital with headache, nausea, and general fatigue. Neurological examination on admission revealed disturbed consciousness, and the patient's general condition was poor. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large tumor in the cerebellar vermis along with an obstructive hydrocephalus. Computed tomographic angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction revealed feeding arteries and a draining vein in this tumor. Based on the clinical features, hemangioblastoma was suspected, and surgical excision and extraction of the fetus were scheduled. However, because of rapid neurological deterioration due to tumor progression, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. After extracting the fetus, the level of consciousness improved, so a tumor resection was planned after the patient's general condition improved. However, the neurological state deteriorated again due to the worsening hydrocephalus, which was suspected to be caused by the increased cerebral blood flow following uterine contraction. Emergency surgery for the brain tumor was performed two days after delivery. The tumor was resected completely and histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient and newborn were discharged with no neurological deficits three weeks after the operation. This case suggested that if we encounter patients with brain tumors complicated by pregnancy, not only is earlier diagnosis from clinical features important, but also persistent additional treatment should be carried out without delay to effectively control intracranial pressure.",{},,No shinkei geka.

29570519,Cystic Progression of a Cavernous Malformation at the Level of the Trigeminal Root Entry Zone Presenting With Sudden Onset of Trigeminal Neuralgia.,"Giacobbo Scavo, Carlo; Roperto, Raffaelino; Cacciotti, Guglielmo; Mastronardi, Luciano",Giacobbo Scavo,"Cavernous malformations (CM) in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) are rare, and most of them are solid and extend from the internal auditory canal into the CPA. In contrast, cystic CM arising in the CPA and not involving the internal auditory canal and dura of the skull base are extremely rare. The authors present an uncommon large cystic progression of a cavernous malformation at the level of the trigeminal root entry zone evolving to severe trigeminal neuralgia and brainstem compression. A 62-year-old female presented a sudden onset of left trigeminal neuralgia, caused by a large cystic lesion at the level of the root entry zone of the left 5th nerve. On neurological examination, she showed slight gait ataxia and hypoesthesia on the left hemiface (on the first and second trigeminal branches). Other cranial nerves were in order. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large cystic intracranial mass, with a small solid portion, leading to brainstem compression. Microsurgical removal of the lesion was performed via retrosigmoid approach, with intraoperative monitoring of somato-sensory evoked potentials, facial, and cochlear nerves. The posterior-medial portion of the lesion was solid, whereas the main portion was cystic, containing xanthochromic fluid. The small solid lesion continued with a thin capsule of a large cyst adherent to brainstem, cerebellar hemisphere, and trigeminal nerve entry zone. A big draining vein arising from the solid part of the lesion runned parallel to brainstem. The mass was piecemeal totally removed.After surgery the patient recovered both left trigeminal neuralgia and hypoesthesia; ataxia was significantly relieved too. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the total removal. Histopathological features were consistent with a CM. At 6-month follow-up, patient's symptoms at the presentation had resolved. The authors present a very rare patient of large cystic cavernous malformation at the level of the trigeminal root entry zone presenting with sudden onset of trigeminal neuralgia. Even if it has not established imaging features, a cystic cavernoma of the cerebello-pontine angle may be suspected when a cystic mass is present, not involving the internal acoustic meatus nor the skull base dura mater.

26142811,Awake Craniotomy in Arteriovenous Malformation Surgery: The Usefulness of Cortical and Subcortical Mapping of Language Function in Selected Patients.,"Gamble, Alexander J; Schaffer, Sarah G; Nardi, Dominic J; Chalif, David J; Katz, Jeffery; Dehdashti, Amir R",Gamble,"Awake craniotomy for removal of intra-axial lesions is a well-established procedure. Few studies, however, have investigated the usefulness of this approach for resection of arteriovenous malformations adjacent to eloquent language areas. We demonstrate our experience by using cortical stimulation mapping and report for the first time on the usefulness of subcortical stimulation with interrogation of language function during resection of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located near language zones. Patients undergoing awake craniotomy for AVMs located in language zones and at least 5 mm away from the closest functional magnetic resonance imaging activation were analyzed. During surgery, cortical bipolar stimulation at 50 Hz, with an intensity of 2 mA, increased to a maximum of 10 mA was performed in the region around the AVM before claiming it negative for language function. In positive language site, the area was restimulated 3 times to confirm the functional deficit. The AVM resection was started based on cortical mapping findings. Further subcortical stimulation performed in concert with speech interrogation by the neuropsychologist continued at key points throughout the resection as feasible. The usefulness of cortical and subcortical stimulation in addition to patient outcomes was analyzed. Between March 2009 and September 2014, 42 brain AVM resections were performed. Four patients with left-sided language zone AVMs underwent awake craniotomy. The AVM locations were fronto-opercular in 2 patients and posterior temporal in 2. The AVM Spetzler-Martin grades were II (2 patients) and III (2 patients). In 1 patient, complete speech arrest was noticed during mapping of the peri-malformation zone, which was not breached during resection. In a second patient who initially demonstrated negative cortical mapping, a speech deficit was noticed during resection and subcortical stimulation. This guided the approach to protect and avoid the sensitive zone. This patient experienced mild postoperative expressive dysphasia that improved to normal within 6 weeks. Complete resection was achieved in all 4 patients. There were no other complications and no permanent neurological morbidity, resulting in good outcome in all 4 patients. Language mapping, both cortical and subcortical during AVM resection, may be valuable in a very select group of AVMs in language zones. Defining safe margins and feedback to the surgeon may provide the highest chances of a surgical cure while minimizing the risk of incurring a language deficit.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.06.059,,Arteriovenous malformation; Awake craniotomy; Cortical mapping; Language; Subcortical stimulation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
24618641,Postoperative stroke after hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture: a report of 2 cases and review of literature.,"Ding, David Yi; Christoforou, Dimitrios; Turner, Garth; Tejwani, Nirmal C",Ding,"Femoral neck fractures in the elderly comprise a significant number of orthopedic surgical cases at a major trauma center. These patients are immediately incapacitated, and surgical fixation can help increase mobility, restore independence, and reduce morbidity and mortality. However, operative treatment carries its own inherent risks including infections, deep vein thromboses, and intraoperative cardiovascular collapse. Cerebrovascular stroke is a relatively uncommon occurrence after hip fractures. We present 2 cases with unusual postoperative medical complication after cemented hip hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture that will serve to illustrate an infrequent but very serious complication. Case 1 was a 73-year-old man with a Garden IV femoral neck fracture who underwent a right hip unipolar cemented hemiarthroplasty under general anesthesia. After uneventful surgery, he developed neurological deficits, and a postoperative noncontrast head computed tomography showed a right medial thalamic infarct. Case 2 was an 82-year-old man with a Garden IV femoral neck fracture who underwent a right hip unipolar cemented hemiarthroplasty under general anesthesia. After uneventful surgery, the patient became hemodynamically unstable. A postoperative noncontrast head computed tomography showed a large evolving left middle cerebral artery stroke. General anesthesia in the setting of decreased cardiac function (decreased ejection fraction and output) carries the risk for ischemic injury to the brain from decreased cerebral perfusion. Risk factors including advanced age, history of coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic disease, and atrial fibrillation increase the risk for perioperative stroke. Furthermore, it is known that during the cementing of implants, microemboli can be released, which must be considered in patients with preoperative heart disease. As a result, consideration of using a noncemented implant or cementing without pressurizing in this clinical scenario should be an important aspect of the preoperative plan in an at-risk patient. Further studies are needed that can elucidate a causal relationship.",{},,Journal of patient safety,10.1097/PTS.0000000000000063,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This tremor is usually related to lesions in the midbrain peduncular region involving the superior cerebellar peduncle, the red nucleus, and possibly the nigrostriatal circuitry. Common etiologies resulting in HT include tumor, ischemia, and demyelination. We report a case of progressive left-sided HT in an otherwise healthy man with additional symptoms of parkinsonism, hypoesthesia, right oculomotor nerve palsy, cognitive dysfunction, and hypersomnolence. Imaging investigations revealed a right-sided thalamic and midbrain glioma. Dopamine transport imaging demonstrated significant dopaminergic denervation in the right caudate and putamen. The degree of striatal dopamine transporter deficiency was more severe than expected in a patient with Parkinson disease. A trial of dopaminergic agent resulted in significant improvement of the tremor and associated symptoms. Interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway can occur in cases of HT because of midbrain peduncular lesion.

A male patient, sixty-two years of age, suffered for over 12 years from headaches, facial deformity, right eye displacement, right eye movement restriction, right-sided ptosis, and facial hypoesthesia. MRI and CT studies revealed an extended hemicranial meningioma. Prior to irradiation, the patient underwent four operations. Eventually, the tumor was irradiated with the CyberKnife in August 2009. Tumor volume composed 1085 cc. The mean dose of 35.3 Gy was delivered in 7 fractions (31.5 Gy at 72% isodose line comprising 95% of tumor volume). The patient was followed during six years and experienced only mild (Grade 1-2 CTCAE) acute skin and mucosa reactions. During the follow-up period, we observed target volume shrinkage for 17% (for 26% after excluding hyperostosis) and regression of intracranial hypertension signs. Due to the extreme volume and complex shape of the tumor, spreading along the surface of the hemisphere as well as an optic nerve involvement, the case presented would not be generally considered suitable for irradiation, especially for hypofractionation. We regard this clinical situation not as a treatment recommendation, but as a demonstration of the underestimated possibilities of hypofractionation regimen and CyberKnife system, both of which are limited with our habit of conventional treatments.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.384,PMC4689568,cyberknife©; hypo-fractionated radiotherapy; meningioma; radiosurgery,Case Reports,United States,eng

However, case reports on anti-sulfatide antibody-related GBS are rare, particularly for atypical cases. A 63 years-old man presented with limb numbness and diplopia persisting for 2 weeks, with marked deterioration over the previous 4 days. His medical history included cerebral infarction, diabetes, and coronary atherosclerotic cardiomyopathy. Physical examination revealed limited movement in his left eye and diminished sensation in his extremities. Initial treatments included antiplatelet agents, cholesterol-lowering drugs, hypoglycemic agents, and medications to improve cerebral circulation. Despite this, his condition worsened, resulting in bilateral facial paralysis, delirium, ataxia, and decreased lower limb muscle strength. Treatment with intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin and dexamethasone resulted in gradual improvement. A 1 month follow-up revealed significant neurological sequelae. A 53 years-old woman was admitted for adenomyosis and subsequently experienced sudden limb weakness, numbness, and pain that progressively worsened, presenting with diminished sensation and muscle strength in all limbs. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, vitamin B1, and mecobalamin were administered. At the 1 month follow-up, the patient still experienced limb numbness and difficulty walking. In both patients, albuminocytologic dissociation was found on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, positive anti-sulfatide antibodies were detected in the CSF, and electromyography indicated peripheral nerve damage. Anti-sulfatide antibody-related GBS can present with Miller-Fisher syndrome, brainstem encephalitis, or a combination of the two, along with severe pyramidal tract damage and residual neurological sequelae, thereby expanding the clinical profile of this GBS subtype.

Coil embolization without stents frequently requires retreatment because of the large size of CS aneurysms. We report the mid-term results of six unruptured CS aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coil embolization (SACE). The mean age of the patients was 72 years. The mean size of the aneurysms was 19.8 mm (range: 13-26 mm). Before treatment, four patients presented with CN dysfunction and two patients had no symptoms. SACE was performed under local or general anesthesia in three patients each. Mean packing density was 29.1% and tight packing was achieved. There were no neurological complications. CN dysfunction was cured in three patients (75%) and partly resolved in one patient (25%). Transient new CN dysfunction was observed in two patients (33%). Clinical and imaging follow-up ranged from 6 to 26 months (median: 16 months). Recanalization was observed in three patients (50%; neck remnant in two patients and dome filling in one patient), but no retreatment has yet been required. No recurrence of CN dysfunction has occurred yet. In summary, SACE increases packing density and may reduce requirement of retreatment with an acceptable cure rate of CN dysfunction. SACE may be a superior treatment for coiling without stents and be an alternative treatment of ICA occlusion for selected patients, such as older patients and those who require a high-flow bypass surgery or cannot receive general anesthesia.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurologia medico-chirurgica,10.2176/nmc.oa2013-0013,PMC4508706,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng
1963787,Cortical mapping and resection under local anaesthetic as an aid to surgery of low and intermediate grade gliomas.,"Walsh, A R; Schmidt, R H; Marsh, H T",Walsh,We report four cases of the use of per-operative cortical mapping during craniotomy under local anaesthesia to define the relationship between the glioma and speech and somatosensory cortex. This enabled a radical subtotal (two cases) or an apparent total (two cases) excision of the tumour close to somatosensory and speech cortex with no permanent neurological deficit. Use of this technique allows radical excision of intrinsic low and intermediate grade gliomas that would otherwise be considered unexcisable and may lead to an improved survival.,{},,British journal of neurosurgery,10.3109/02688699008993797,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

D.G., a 62-year-old man, came to our attention for a transient episode of left weakness and hypoesthesia. The electrocardiogram revealed a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. CT angiography showed right ICAO; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies with perfusion imaging revealed a severe hemispheric hypoperfusion. Full anticoagulation therapy was started, and antihypertensive therapy was reduced to help collateral circulation. Some weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the stroke unit for 2 episodes of left-hand weakness. Cerebral angiography confirmed right ICAO from the proximal tract to the siphon. After some days, the patient suffered a femoral hemorrhagic lesion, with active bleeding, and was treated with surgical intervention. On the following day, the patient presented with left hemiplegia with hemianesthesia (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 14). The patient was treated in the emergency department with a complex endovascular treatment with complete recanalization of ICAO by positioning 3 stents through the intravenous infusion of abciximab. After intensive rehabilitation, at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, the patient regained autonomy. In literature, treatment of chronic ICAO is not indicated. Endovascular recanalization may be beneficial to patients with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion due to ICAO, when all conservative medical therapies have failed.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2016.04.019,,Stroke; hypoperfusion; internal carotid artery occlusion; stenting,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

18555878,[Sensory syndrome and aphasia after left insular infarct].,"Peskine, A; Galland, A; Chounlamountry, A Weill; Pradat-Diehl, P",Peskine,"Sensorial impairment without hemiplegia is usually caused by a thalamic lesion. A 28-year-old woman presented with hemianesthesia associated with aphasia following a left insular lesion, subsequent to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain MRI Flair sequence revealed a high intensity signal in the left insular and frontal subcortical regions. Insular infarct was diagnosed, associated with hemorrhagic sequelae. Study of the normal and pathologic insular cortex suggest several implications of the region in somatosensory and language functions. However, the insular cortex has been mainly associated with central pain. Lasting objective hypoesthesia has been very rarely documented. The left insular cortex has also been implicated in speech apraxia but our patient presented with fluent aphasia mostly affecting the rhythm of speech, as it has been observed in thalamic aphasia.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2008.01.005,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

Magnetic resonance imaging showed relatively symmetrical, subcortical, white matter abnormalities, predominantly affecting the occipital, posterior temporal and parietal lobes and the cerebellum. T2-dependent abnormalities and elevated regional apparent diffusion coefficient were present in a pattern typical for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The clinical and radiological manifestations were resolved completely with supportive therapy. This case of PRES may be a late complication of gemcitabine or cisplatin therapy precipitated by a general anaesthetic, or associated electrolyte or blood pressure disturbance.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuroradiology,10.1007/s00234-005-1376-6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
