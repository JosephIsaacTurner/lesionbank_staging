33762449,[Intracerebral Hemorrhage].,"Hiramatsu, Masafumi; Haruma, Jun; Hishikawa, Tomohito; Sugiu, Kenji; Date, Isao",Hiramatsu,"CT angiography(CTA)plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH). An 85-year-old woman presented with a disturbance of consciousness and right hemiparesis. Non-contrast CT of the brain revealed intracerebral hemorrhage in the left thalamus spreading to the internal capsule, corona radiata, and midbrain and a ""swirl sign."" CTA revealed no vascular anomaly. The early and delayed CTA phases revealed the""spot sign"" and ""leakage sign,"" respectively. Non-contrast CT three hours after the initial CT showed the enlargement of the hematoma. After the detection of ICH by initial non-contrast CT, CTA should be performed to differentiate between the causes of secondary ICH and detect the imaging markers of hematoma expansion or rebleeding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the ""spot sign"" detected by CTA is a valid imaging marker for hematoma expansion. In this article, the differential diagnosis of ICH and the detection of the imaging markers of hematoma expansion using non-contrast CT and CTA have been discussed.",{},,No shinkei geka.

38073163,Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Presenting as Simultaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; Aguilar-Fuentes, Victor; Benavides-Gómez, Fernando; Ruiz-Sandoval, José Luis",Jiménez-Ruiz,"A 37-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department with central facial palsy, ipsilateral right hemiparesis, and seizures. Brain Computed Tomogram (CT) showed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and bilateral frontal edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal hemorrhages consistent with a diagnosis of multiple simultaneous ICH (MSICH) (Figure 1). We suspected cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and performed a MR angiogram confirming this diagnosis (Figure 2). Upon admission, the patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and transitioned to direct oral anticoagulation at discharge. Non traumatic MSICH is a rare imaging finding with high mortality, usually arterial in origin (1). However, since treatment options vary, cerebral venous thrombosis should always be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in young female patients with known risk factors, such as pregnancy and puerperium (2-4). MRI modalities (Echo-GRE) are valuable tools in identifying ICH when CT is inconclusive (5).",{},,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,China (Republic : 1949- ),eng

There are three clinical syndromes associated with lateral thalamic infarction: (1) hemisensory loss, hemiataxia, and involuntary movements; (2) pure sensory stroke; and (3) sensory-motor stroke. Ataxia, adventitious movements, and sensory loss are due to infarction of the lateral, posterolateral, and posteromedial ventral nuclei caused by occlusion of the PCA proximal to the thalamogeniculate artery branches or by occlusion of large thalamogeniculate arteries. Pure sensory and sensory-motor strokes are due to smaller infarcts in the posterolateral-posteromedial ventral complex and adjacent internal capsule caused by occlusion of penetrating artery branches of the thalamogeniculate arteries.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1988.00520330037008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
33455561,Delayed cerebral thrombosis complicating bacterial meningitis.,"Depoortere, Sofie; Toeback, Jonas; Lunskens, Sophie; Van Buggenhout, Erwig; Oedit, Regilio; Hemelsoet, Dimitri",Depoortere,"Delayed cerebral thrombosis has been described as a potential cause of cerebrovascular complications in patients with bacterial meningitis. We report a case of delayed cerebral thrombosis in a 63-year-old woman admitted for pneumococcal meningitis. Initially, there was a good clinical evolution under treatment with steroids and antibiotics. On day 8 after admission, she was found with a decreased level of consciousness. Her neurological condition gradually worsened. Repeated brain imaging showed extensive ischemic lesions. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, the patient died. A literature search was conducted. Data on patient characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were collected. To date, 28 cases with delayed cerebral thrombosis following bacterial meningitis have been reported. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the pathogen in 89% of cases. Clinical deterioration occurred in all patients, with a duration varying from 5 to 40 days between admission and deterioration. Most common symptom was altered consciousness (83%), followed by hemiparesis (52%). Brain imaging typically shows new infarctions (96%). Fifty-six percent of patients were treated with corticosteroids after deterioration. Outcome was poor with mortality rate of 46%. Delayed cerebral thrombosis presents as a clinical deterioration, typically a sudden decline in consciousness, more than 5 days after meningitis onset. Brain imaging shows new widespread ischemic lesions. Diagnosis should be made carefully, based on clinical findings and brain imaging, after excluding endocarditis. The underlying etiology remains unknown. When delayed cerebral thrombosis is suspected, high-dose corticosteroids should be started empirically. The prognosis remains poor with high mortality rates.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Acta clinica Belgica,10.1080/17843286.2021.1873583,,Bacterial meningitis; cerebrovascular complication; corticosteroids; delayed cerebral thrombosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35431875,Dysarthria-Facial Paresis and Rostral Pontine Ischemic Stroke.,"Miyawaki, Edison K; Wilcox, Douglas R; Kraft, Andrew W; Guenette, Jeffrey P",Miyawaki,"We describe an acute, postoperative dysarthria-facial paresis. While the rare stroke syndrome has been described previously, we present an under-described clinical nuance to its presentation with a particularly clear imaging correlation. A 78-year-old, right-handed man with a past medical history of aortic stenosis presented after a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Immediately postoperatively, no neurological deficits were noted. That evening, he described his speech as ""drunken."" He was later noted to have a right lower facial droop in addition to the speech change. His speech exhibited labial, lingual, and (to a lesser degree) guttural dysarthria. At the patient's request due to claustrophobia, he received 2 mg of oral lorazepam prior to cranial imaging. Afterwards, he was sleepy but arousable, yet was unable to put pen to paper when asked to write. Right lower facial paresis persisted, but he now demonstrated a right pronator drift, which resolved after 14 h without other evolution to his clinical examination. Brainstem lesions above the level of the pontine facial nucleus may present with central facial paresis contralateral to the lesion. An associated dysarthria may have both labial and lingual features in the absence of tongue or pharyngeal weakness. Our review of reported cases of dysarthria in isolation, dysarthria in combination with facial paresis, and facial paresis finds that all presentations may result from cortical, subcortical, or brainstem involvement. Stroke mechanisms are most commonly thromboembolic or small-vessel-ischemic in either the anterior or posterior circulations.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000522283,PMC8958628,Dysarthria; Facial paresis; Ischemic stroke; Pons,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The treatment should be individualized depending on the case. A 49-year-old man presented with hemiparesis. Preoperative neuroimaging revealed a giant lesion and an AVM on the left hemisphere of the brain. Craniotomy and tumour resection were performed. The AVM was not treated and needed to be followed up. The histological diagnosis was meningioma (World Health Organization grade I). The patient was in good neurological condition postoperatively. This case adds to the growing literature suggesting that the association between the two lesions is complex. Besides, treatment depends on the risk of neurologic function damage and hemorrhagic stroke of meningiomas and AVMs.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Current medical imaging,10.2174/1573405619666230310091939,,Arteriovenous Malformation; Case report; Cerebral; Coexistence; Craniotomy; Meningioma,Case Reports,United Arab Emirates,eng
38098127,Emotional dysmetria after cerebellar-pontine stroke: a case report.,"Long, Rebecca M; DuVal, Michèle; Mulvany-Robbins, Bridget; Wagner, Amanda N; Jickling, Glen C",Long,"Pseudobulbar affect, or emotional dysregulation, commonly occurs following stroke. However, it is frequently missed in cases involving the cerebellum, resulting in a lack of treatment, which can directly impact stroke rehabilitation. A 63-year-old Caucasian female with no history of mood disorders presented with gait instability, dysarthria, and right sided hemiplegia, secondary to cerebellar and pontine ischemic stroke from a basilar occlusion. She underwent endovascular therapy and her deficits gradually improved. However during recovery she began to develop uncontrollable tearfulness while retaining insight that her emotional expression was contextually inappropriate. She was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported improvements in her emotional regulation at one year follow up. This case highlights cerebellar injury as a potential cause of poorly regulated emotions, or an emotional dysmetria. The recognition of this disorder in patients with cerebellar or pontine strokes is critical, as untreated pseudobulbar affect can impact future stroke rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04294-1,PMC10722665,Case report; Cerebellum; Depression; Emotional lability; Ischemic stroke; Pseudobulbar affect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
38050508,Acute Caudate Nucleus Stroke Presenting As Hemiballismus.,"Babici, Denis; Mohamed, Ali A; Mattner, Olivia; Demiraj, Francis; Hammond, Thomas",Babici,"Hemiballismus is defined as irregular, involuntary, large-amplitude flinging movements by the limbs, confined to one side of the body. Hemichorea refers to a state of excessive and irregularly timed, non-repetitive and randomly distributed, spontaneous, involuntary, and abrupt movements. It is widely believed that hemiballismus and chorea are suggestive of a lesion to the basal ganglia and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, there are other etiologies that may influence the clinical presentation. Patients may present with certain common clinical features corresponding to the affected area of the brain. For example, infarctions of the motor cortex present with hemiplegia or paralysis of one side of the body. Similarly, infarctions involving the language areas of the brain present with aphasia and are detrimental to speech production or comprehension and the ability to read and write. Typically, acute-onset hemichorea is suggestive of a lesion in the STN. Herein, we present a rare case of acute hemiballismus and hemichorea following infarction of the left caudate nucleus, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) imaging modalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48209,PMC10693717,basal ganglia infarction; basal ganglia stroke; chorea and hemiballismus; haloperidol; subthalamic nucleus,Case Reports,United States,eng

Two patients diagnosed with hemorrhagic stroke and GBS were reported. More specifically, the sequential occurrence and the corresponding mechanisms of these 2 diseases were analyzed. Two patients with cerebral hemorrhagic stroke developed progressive flaccid quadriplegia and life-threatening dyspnea in acute stage. Combined with the cerebrospinal fluid and electromyogram results, they were diagnosed as having acute GBS. It was found that GBS and cerebral nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage can occur successively, but the different sequences of occurrence had completely different pathogeneses. GBS following CNS hemorrhage was found to be related to the imbalance of systemic inflammatory responses, whereas CNS hemorrhage following GBS was due to blood vessel autonomous dysfunction and the use of immunoglobulin intravenously. Both groups of patients had only good prognoses when they were intensively observed. Despite being rare, GBS complicated with CNS hemorrhage deserves more attention due to its notable impact.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,European neurology,10.1159/000450603,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

Masticatory muscle weakness was confirmed by an electrophysiological study performed on the day after admission in which there was an incomplete interference pattern without spontaneous denervation activity, suggesting that the patient's masseter muscle weakness was caused by an infarction of the trigeminal motor nucleus proper or trigeminal motor nerve fascicles rather than Wallerian degeneration of the trigeminal nerve or the progression of masseter muscle degeneration.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105623,,Ischemic stroke; Masseter muscle; Pontine infarction; Trigeminal motor nucleus,Case Reports,United States,eng

Preoperative examination revealed paresis of the left sixth cranial nerve, left seventh nerve paralysis, right-sided hemihypoesthesia, right-sided severe hemiparesis owing to which the patient could not move independently, and dynamic ataxia in the left limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cavernoma with hemorrhage in the left side of the pons. The surgery was performed in the prone position. After a median skin and soft tissue incision about 6-7 cm long, an open-door keyhole craniotomy was performed. Dura over the left cerebellar hemisphere was opened in a semilunar fashion. The dissection of the uvulotonsillar fissure was performed from its cranial part, where the medial trunk of the cortical segment of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was the reference point. Following the dissection, the tela choroidea was incised, and the left half of the rhomboid fossa was exposed. After the mapping, the floor of the fourth ventricle was incised in the suprafacial triangle. Cavernoma and hematoma were removed. Hemostasis was achieved. Dura was closed.

Neuroimaging found occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with early signs of ischemic stroke. He received intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Abdominal computed tomography discovered a splenic infarction with hemorrhagic transformation and bilateral renal infarction. Urgent angiography showed an associated splenic pseudoaneurysm, which was embolized without complications. He was treated with intermediate-dose anticoagulation (1 mg subcutaneous enoxaparin/kg/24 h), acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg and 5 days of intravenous corticosteroids.

36636275,Rapid Change in Shape of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm with Acute Perforating Infarction.,"Tanaka, Tatsuya; Goto, Hirofumi; Momozaki, Nobuaki; Honda, Eiichiro",Tanaka,"Acute ischemic stroke is a rare complication resulting from an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA). Ischemic stroke adjacent to the aneurysms is considered the risk of rupture of aneurysms. However, there is presently no consensus on the optimal strategy for the management of UIAs with ischemic stroke. A 27-year-old woman presented with sudden onset left hemiparesis. Acute infarction of the right basal ganglia and an aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery were discovered on brain imaging. Antiplatelet therapy was used to treat her. The diagnosis revealed ischemic stroke caused by a thrombosed aneurysm due to the change in the shape of the aneurysm on day 4. The UIA clipping procedure was performed on day 21 due to the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The findings of the surgery and indocyanine green imaging revealed a partially thrombosed aneurysm and occlusion of a perforating artery. As is well known, enlargement of aneurysm size indicates increasing rupture risk. In the present case, after ischemic events developed, magnetic resonance angiography revealed enlargement of the aneurysm. The findings of the surgery revealed possible pathogenic mechanisms were perforating artery occlusion due to local extension of the luminal thrombus. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of ischemic stroke due to luminal thrombosis of the UIA and SAH and should consider urgent treatment of the UIA even immediately after ischemic stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000527451,PMC9830295,Ischemic stroke; Perforater infarction; Thrombosed aneurysm; Thrombosis; Unruptured intracranial aneurysm,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

35573510,Transient Ischemic Attack Due to Unruptured Basilar Artery Aneurysm.,"Bhat, Vivek; Kodapala, Suresha",Bhat,"Intracranial aneurysms are typically asymptomatic. They are usually incidentally detected or detected only after rupture. Ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is rare. A 79-year-old male with well-controlled hypertension and hypothyroidism, presented with complaints of sudden-onset weakness of the right upper limb and lower limb, followed by altered sensorium and a fall. Two hours later, he had fully recovered. Neurologic examination was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the brain revealed a dilated and tortuous basilar artery, suggestive of an aneurysm compressing the left midbrain and pons, with no evidence of intracranial bleed. Further, magnetic resonance imaging with an angiogram revealed multiple lacunar infarcts in the posterior circulation, distal to the aneurysm. Finally, a cerebral angiogram confirmed a partially thrombosed, fusosaccular aneurysm, arising from the left vertebral and basilar arteries. In view of frailty and long vessel segment involvement, surgery was not advised. He was treated medically, with appropriate antiplatelets and prophylactic antiepileptics. On follow-up, he had no neurologic deficit and had suffered no later ischemic or hemorrhagic events. UIAs may cause brainstem strokes via thrombosis of the parent vessel, emboli from the thrombus, or compression of the parent artery. In our case, compression, the least common mechanism, appears to have caused the TIA, with emboli potentially responsible for the silent lacunar infarcts. Fusiform aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system have a poor natural history. In elderly patients presenting with ischemic events due to UIAs of the vertebrobasilar system, surgical intervention can be risky. So, medical treatment with antiplatelets is recommended. UIAs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with TIAs, and such patients should have a visualization of intracranial arteries.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.24102,PMC9103616,aneurym; antiplatelet therapy; cerebrovascular disease; endovascular aneurysm repair; hemiplegia; stroke; subarachnoid hemorrhage; tia,Case Reports,United States,eng

A CBS typically combines ipsilateral cranial nerves deficits to contralateral long tracts involvement such as hemiparesis or hemianesthesia. Classical CBS seem in fact not to be so clear-cut entities with up to 20% of patients showing different or unnamed combinations of crossed symptoms. In terms of etiologies, acute brainstem infarction predominates but CBS secondary to hemorrhage, neoplasm, abscess, and demyelination have been described. The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of CBS caused by a bleeding episode arising from a brainstem cavernous malformation (BCM) reported in the literature. We present the case of a typical Foville syndrome in a 65-year-old man that was caused by a pontine BCM with extralesional bleeding. Following the first bleeding episode, a conservative management was decided but the patient had eventually to be operated on soon after the second bleeding event. A literature review was conducted focusing on the five most common CBS (Benedikt, Weber, Foville, Millard-Gubler, Wallenberg) on Medline database from inception to 2020. According to the literature, hemorrhagic BCM account for approximately 7 % of CBS. Microsurgical excision may be indicated after the second bleeding episode but needs to be carefully weighted up against the risks of the surgical procedure and openly discussed with the patient. In the setting of a CBS, neuroimaging work-up may not infrequently reveal a BCM requiring complex multidisciplinary team management including neurosurgical advice.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02223-7,PMC8136125,Brainstem cavernous malformation; Crossed brainstem syndrome; Developmental venous anomaly; Foville syndrome; Intracranial hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We present a female patient in her early sixties with a past medical history significant for hypertension who presented with acute right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale = 20). Computed tomography (CT)-head was unremarkable but she was outside the window for chemical thrombolytic therapy. CT-angiogram revealed occlusion of the left extracranial and intracranial internal carotid artery and, thus, she was deemed not a candidate for mechanical thrombectomy. CT-perfusion scans (Rapid software) showed a large penumbra within the respective vascular territory affected including the operculum and the insula. The core infarction was relatively small and located in the left basal ganglia. After inducing therapeutic hypertension, the patient's aphasia improved. Surprisingly, this unmasked a moderate to severe hypophonic voice. The patient underwent flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy which showed a paralyzed left vocal cord but without signs of inflammation.

His symptoms showed a gradual improvement from upward gaze paralysis and convergence disorder followed by downward gaze paralysis. All symptoms disappeared in 3 weeks after the onset. The center of vertical eye movement was thought to be the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) and posterior commissure (PC). In this case, bilateral riMLF and PC were impaired, resulting in bilateral vertical ocular motility disorder with upward gaze paralysis. Brainstem hemorrhage rarely presents with vertical gaze palsy. Most are cerebral infarctions, and few are due to cerebral hemorrhage. This case was important for better understanding the pathophysiology of an ocular motility disorder.

The result ABC showed that the language functions in the patient, including spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition and naming, were improved after the speech therapy. In addition, results of follow-up DTT suggested that the fiber pathway between the splenium of corpus callosum and the left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) had been established. At the same time, fiber connections between the genu of corpus callosum and the right inferior frontal gyrus (the mirror region of Broca's area) were increased.

Still, intracerebral hematomas are rarely thought to be caused by DVAs. In this report, the authors present a unique case of a DVA that hemorrhaged spontaneously, rather than hemorrhaging into a venous infarction following DVA thrombosis as has been more commonly reported. A 22-year-old previously healthy male presented to the emergency department with a severe headache, confusion, and progressive hemiparesis. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a spontaneous left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH), with intraventricular extension and acute hydrocephalus. CT angiography did not demonstrate an underlying vascular malformation. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for a left parietal craniotomy for evacuation of the hematoma. Intraoperative pathology was consistent with a DVA Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) did not demonstrate a mass lesion, ischemic stroke, or underlying vascular malformation. An MRI obtained three years previously for headaches was normal. A postoperative diagnostic cerebral angiogram was normal. An MRI/MRA performed six months postoperatively demonstrated two foci of abnormal vessels on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), suggesting the presence of a venous vascular malformation. A diagnostic cerebral angiogram obtained six months postoperatively was again normal, including delayed imaging. Few reports have cited DVA as the sole cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. While very rare, these reports suggest hemorrhagic conversion of a venous infarction secondary to a thrombosed DVA as a possible etiology, and several provide imaging consistent with this diagnosis. This case study demonstrates a unique presentation of a hemorrhagic DVA in the absence of thrombosis or stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The neuroradiology journal,10.1177/1971400916665387,PMC5131763,Developmental venous anomaly; angiography; intraparenchymal hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Usually the etiology is cardioembolic or small vessel disease combined with individual anatomical predisposition. The symptoms include a variety of neurological deficits depending on thalamic structure involvement, such as paresthesias or numbness, hemiparesis with increased reflexes and Babinski sign, third cranial nerve palsy, speech and cognition disturbance, memory impairment and stupor. Neuroimaging usually reveals ischemic loci in adequate thalamic nuclei. We report a case of 61-year-old man, active smoker (25/per day, 50 pack-years) with untreated hypertension who presented at admission consciousness impairment (Glasgow Coma Scale score 9 points), left pupil dilatation without reaction to light, left eye deviation downwards and outwards, vertical gaze paralysis and left-sided hemiplegia.

Brain magnetic resonance with diffusion weighted imaging and fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequences (MR DWI/FLAIR) performed on admission showed ischemic changes in bilateral thalami, which were confirmed in routine MRI. Thrombosis of basilar artery and cerebral venous was excluded in CT angiography. Further diagnostic assessment revealed hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and renal cancer with hepatic metastases. Bilateral thalamic stroke due to artery of Percheron occlusion is a rare presentation of stroke, which can be overlooked in routine CT scan.

This approach, however, may involve risks of neurological deficits when the residual AVM is in eloquent cortex. We present a case of complete thrombosis of a residual AVM after surgery. This residual AVM tissue was located in eloquent cortex. Complete spontaneous thrombosis of residual AVMs after surgery has only rarely been reported. This phenomenon raises questions regarding the most appropriate management for residual AVMs in eloquent cortex. The patient was a 43-year-old, right-handed, male patient with an AVM centered in the left precentral gyrus. The patient presented with medically intractable seizures and progressive right hemiparesis. After AVM resection, angiography revealed a residual AVM with early venous drainage. Angiography performed 1 week later demonstrated a persisting AVM nidus without early venous drainage. Angiography performed 3 months later demonstrated complete thrombosis of the residual AVM. The patient has been monitored for more than 1 year, without additional symptoms or therapy. We continue to advocate prompt return to the operating room when postoperative angiography reveals a residual AVM with persistent shunting. When the residual AVM is in eloquent cortex and is small, with a single draining vein, however, observation of the patient (with strict blood pressure control) and repeat angiography after 1 week represent an alternative strategy that is supported by this case report. As this case demonstrates, it is possible for small residual AVMs to thrombose.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is a main complication of intravenous thrombolysis, however, no data are available on the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with thrombolysis-associated intracerebral hemorrhage. This constellation is expected to become more frequent as increasing numbers of patients are treated under the drip-and-ship paradigm. A 75-year-old male patient was admitted to an emergency department with acute onset dysarthria and left side hemiparesis due to right middle cerebral artery occlusion. Intravenous thrombolysis was initiated and the patient transferred to our center for mechanical thrombectomy. Upon arrival, cerebral imaging showed persistent right middle cerebral artery occlusion and new onset left frontal, temporal, and parietal intracerebral hemorrhage. Thrombectomy was performed and perfusion completely re-established with excellent neurological outcome. Follow-up imaging revealed probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

Six new cases and a review of the literature.,"Ott, B R; Saver, J L",Ott,"Although persistent amnesia due to bilateral limbic system infarction is well described, reports of amnesic syndromes due to unilateral stroke have appeared infrequently and unsystematically. We report six new cases and review previously published reports to expand and consolidate knowledge regarding amnesic stroke. Six patients developed acute amnesia associated with unilateral stroke. Brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed lesions in limbic structures, which accounted for the memory deficit. Based on these as well as similar cases in the literature, we delineate three distinct syndromes of unilateral amnesic stroke involving the territories of the posterior cerebral, anterior choroidal, and thalamic penetrating arteries. Eighty-five percent of reported cases have involved the left hemisphere. Persistent as well as transient amnesia may be the sole or primary manifestation of unilateral hemispheric stroke. The vascular mechanisms of amnesic stroke are diverse. Patients presenting with acute amnesia possibly related to cerebral ischemia should be classified by documented or presumed lesion site as well as the involved vascular territory.

Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies over that period revealed three high-intensity signal lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, appearing in chronological order in the left upper and left lower medulla oblongata and left pontine base. Despite some clinical improvement following methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the patient died of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed four fresh, well-defined lesions in the brainstem, three of which corresponded to the lesions detected radiologically. The remaining lesion was located in the dorsal medulla oblongata and involved the right solitary nucleus. This might have appeared at a later disease stage, eventually causing respiratory failure. Histologically, all four lesions showed loss of myelin, preservation of axons, and infiltration of lymphocytes, predominantly CD8-positive T cells, consistent with the histological features of autoimmune demyelinating diseases, particularly the confluent demyelination observed in the early and acute phases of multiple sclerosis (MS). In the cerebral white matter, autoimmune demyelination appeared superimposed on ischemic changes, consistent with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI findings on initial admission. No anti-AQP4 or MOG antibodies or those potentially causing autoimmune encephalitis/demyelination were detected in either the serum or CSF. Despite several similarities to MS, such as the relapsing-remitting disease course and lesion histology, the entire clinicopathological picture in the present patient, especially the advanced age at onset and development of brainstem lesions in close proximity within a short time frame, did not fit those of MS or other autoimmune diseases that are currently established. The present results suggest that exceptionally older individuals can be affected by an as yet unknown inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12976,,CNS; aging; autoimmunity; cerebral small vessel disease; demyelination,Case Reports,Australia,eng

25966874,Severe central and peripheral paraneoplastic demyelination associated with tumours of the ovaries.,"Jurkiewicz, Elzbieta; Kotulska, Katarzyna; Nowak, Katarzyna; Malczyk, Katarzyna; Borkowska, Julita; Bilska, Małgorzata",Jurkiewicz,"The aim of the study is to present MRI examinations of the brain and spinal cord, performed in girls with acute severe neurological presentation of paraneoplastic syndrome associated with ovarian teratomas. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is a rare disorder caused by remote effects of malignancy in different organs. The pathogenesis of PNS concerns the autoimmune system and specific antibodies. PNS can be seen as encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, brainstem encephalitis, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. These symptoms are potentially reversible, if the underlying neoplasm is removed. We presented three girls, aged 13, 17, and 18 years. They were all referred to the hospital because of an acute onset of severe disseminated encephalomyelitis. All MRI exams were performed on a 1.5 T scanner with a routine brain and spinal cord protocol, including TSE T2-WI and FLAIR sequences. In all cases, a contrast agent was injected in the standard dose. Neurological examination performed at the onset of the disease revealed hemiparesis, seizures, and consciousness disturbances. In one girl, visual field loss was also disclosed. They were all healthy before the onset of the disease. Brain and spinal cord MR imaging revealed multiple hyperintense lesions located supratentorially in the white matter of both hemispheres, in the pons, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Patients were treated with methyloprednisolone IV and IVIG. They all improved but significant sequelae were present. Two of them developed symptoms of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy within 2 months after the onset of encephalomyelitis. At the same time, brain MRI showed progression of the lesions. In two patients, anti-Yo antibodies were present in blood. Extensive examinations revealed bilateral ovarian teratomas in two patients, and left-sided ovarian teratoma in one case. Surgical resection of teratomas resulted in rapid clinical improvement. These cases show that in children and adolescents, acute demyelinating disease can be a manifestation of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Thus, PNS should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. In female children and adolescents with suspected PNS, it is important to search for ovarian tumours.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,10.1007/s00381-015-2731-5,PMC4560768,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

In this article we present, for the first time, the tonsillouveal transaqueductal approach to access a progressively symptomatic cavernoma within the depth of the tegmentum of the mesencephalon. A 52-year-old woman presented with a history of slowly progressive right-sided hemiparesis and ataxia. On magnetic resonance imaging, a relatively large cavernoma involving the tegmentum of the mesencephalon was shown. The sylvian aqueduct was patent and there was no secondary ventriculomegaly. The patient underwent surgery via a suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy. The right tonsillouveal and medullotonsillar spaces were opened to the level of the choroidal point of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery. The tela choroidea was incised from the foramen of Magendie to the telovelar junction. Looking through the aqueduct and at a point 5 mm superior to its inferior inlet, there was a small cherry-like blister protruding into the aqueductal anterior surface. This was used as an entry point to access the cavernoma. The space around the cavernoma was gently dissected and the cavernoma was circumferentially coagulated to shrink it in a concentric manner toward its center. The total removal of the lesion was achieved and the histopathological findings were consistent with a cavernoma. As a result of noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the patient needed a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The 1-year postoperative neurological examination was consistent with preoperative findings. This report shows, for the first time, direct surgical removal of a cavernous hemangioma in the mesencephalic tegmentum via the aqueduct.

We present an unusual case of extensive brainstem intraparenchymal hemorrhage in a patient with COVID-19 to caution readers of this possible complication in patients positive for COVID-19. In this report, we outline the clinical presentation of a 40-year-old male who developed severe coughing and sneezing before presenting to the emergency department with confusion, somnolence, and respiratory distress. CT head without contrast revealed extensive pontine and midbrain hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and early hydrocephalus. Neurological examination revealed pinpoint, minimally reactive pupils, withdrawal to painful stimuli in the right hemibody, left hemibody paresis, and intact left corneal, cough, and gag reflexes. MRI and MRA brain revealed no evidence of an underlying vascular lesion. Over the next two days, the patient had worsening multiorgan failure and hypoxemia without intracranial hypertension. He remained too unstable to undergo cerebral angiogram. On hospital day four, his neurological examination deteriorated to quadriparesis and only cough and gag reflexes remaining intact after which his family opted for comfort measures only.

As a rare complication of thrombolysis, remote intracerebral hemorrhage (rICH) whose mechanisms are unclear has not gained enough attention until now. We present here a case of 26-year-old pregnant woman at 31 weeks gestation who suffered from sudden onset right-sided hemiparesis and slurred speech. She successfully received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator thrombolysis within 2.5 hours from stroke onset. Further workup demonstrated multiple and bilateral acute cerebral infarcts due to cardioembolism. At 6 hours after thrombolysis, multifocal intracerebral hemorrhages were developed in her left cerebellum and right temporal cortex, remote from the initial infarct areas. However, the patient achieved a final complete recovery of symptoms. Despite diffusion-weighted imaging could not confirm infarct in the areas of hemorrhages, multiple cerebral embolism was suggested to be involved in the etiology of rICH. rICH is different from local intracerebral hemorrhage in its risk factors, neurological outcomes, and underlying mechanisms. Patients with rICH may have favorable outcomes and multiple cerebral embolism is still one of the important mechanisms for postthrombolytic rICH.",{},,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000165,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

A 54-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained severe traumatic brain injury. Two months later, she developed bilateral proptosis and audible bruit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain demonstrated the right direct CCF. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed a small hyperintense area at the left basal ganglia. Ten days later, she developed right-sided grade 2/5 hemiparesis, facial upper motor neuron weakness, and cognitive impairment. Follow-up MRI showed significant progression of hyperintensities involving the left-sided centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum, basal frontal, temporal lobes, especially subcortical white matter on FLAIR images, and multiple hypointense foci of hemorrhagic component on T2*-weighted gradient-echo images, representing hemorrhagic venous infarction. While waiting for embolization, she rapidly developed right hemiplegia and aphasia, and became somnolent. Under general anesthesia, emergency endovascular treatment was performed successfully to obliterate the fistula without surgical intervention. Five months after endovascular treatment, MRI and MRA confirmed no residual fistula and revealed nearly complete resolution of abnormal increased signal intensity. In the present case, the factors related to the presence of this rare condition were absence of the ipsilateral basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR), occlusion of posterior segment of the contralateral superior petrosal sinus, and a developed uncal vein with hypoplastic second and third segments of the contralateral BVR.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,"Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",10.1177/1591019918776615,PMC6116133,Venous infarction; basal vein of Rosenthal; direct carotid-cavernous fistula; traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula; venous congestion,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

We report four cases of cerebral venous thrombosis limited to the cortical veins. The diagnosis was made on surgical intervention in one patient and by angiography in three patients. Together with a survey of the published cases, the clinical and neuroimaging patterns of our patients allow delineation of several features suggestive of cortical venous stroke. Focal or generalized seizures followed by hemiparesis, aphasia, hemianopia, or other focal neurologic dysfunction in the absence of signs of increased intracranial pressure should suggest this possibility. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI) shows an ischemic lesion that does not follow the boundary of arterial territories and often has a hemorrhagic component, without signs of venous sinus thrombosis. Conventional angiography demonstrates no arterial occlusion but may show cortical vein thrombosis corresponding to the infarct, although these may also be nonspecific findings.

Two conspicuous points of the present patient are the sensory cortical infarction and an association with renal failure. In this patient, the sensory cortical infarction must produce chorea even though sensory cortical lesions rarely caused chorea. The associated renal dysfunction may play some role in the production of chorea. The double-crash of cerebral infarction and metabolic abnormality (renal dysfunction) may cause hemichorea which is rarely seen in patients with cerebral infarction of the sensory cortex and insula with no metabolic abnormalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001527,,acute cerebral infarction; hemichorea; intravenous thrombolysis therapy; middle cerebral artery; renal dysfunction,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

6461386,The perception of motor commands or effort during muscular paralysis.,"Gandevia, S C",Gandevia,"An observation by Mach (1906) on the sense of effort during hemiplegia has been confirmed. Two patients, who became suddenly hemiplegic, without sensory symptoms, noted that attempts to move when first paralysed were not accompanied by a sense of effort, but that attempts to move when movement first returned were accompanied by distinct sensations of effort or heaviness. This absence of a sense of effort during upper motor neuron paralysis without sensory signs did not occur either in a group of patients with pure lower motor neuron paralysis or in patients with clinically complete spinal transection. Previous studies have suggested that signals of motor command or effort, which arise at levels rostral to spinal motoneurons, contribute to the estimation of weights and tensions (see McCloskey et al., 1974; Gandevia and McCloskey, 1977a). One interpretation of the return of a sensation of effort as hemiplegia progresses to paresis is that activity in corticofugal paths contributes to generation of the sense of effort. During complete hemiplegia there is no neural traffic in motor corticofugal paths below the internal capsule and a sense of effort is absent. But, during paresis, there is increased neural traffic in the uninterrupted corticofugal fibres and there is a strong sense of effort or heaviness. Alternatively, a subcortical structure with a critical ascending projection to motor cortical areas may co-operate in generation the sense of effort. Afferent information, while important for calibrating and scaling the sense of effort which usually signals force or weight, is not essential for generation of a crude signal of descending motor command or effort.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/105.1.151,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Yaşargil classified mediobasal AVM into four subtypes: amygdala, anterior hippocampal, middle hippocampal, and posterior hippocampal lesions. The lesions around the trigone extending forward to the temporal horn, and medially adjacent to the midbrain, can be referred to as posterior hippocampal AVMs. The therapeutic indications and operative approaches for these lesions remain controversial. Nine patients underwent surgical resection for AVMs of the posterior hippocampus using a laterobasal approach. In four patients, AVMs were located chiefly within the lateral ventricle, and the lesions were resected using a laterobasal approach through the occipitotemporal sulcus, or through a hematoma cavity within the fusiform gyrus. Clinical improvement followed the procedure in three of four patients. In the remaining five patients, the nidi were located chiefly within the ambient cistern, extending upward to the basal ganglia. Contralateral hemiparesis occurred in three patients. Two patients showed marked improvement following an initial decline in neurologic status. A laterobasal transventricular approach is suitable for ventricular AVMs, whereas only limited exposure can be afforded through a transventricular, transchoroidal fissure route for the AVMs within the ambient cistern.

This case confirms that unilateral destruction of the posterior commissure, rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF and interstitial nucleus of Cajal produces a non-dissociated upgaze palsy. Involvement of the nucleus of Cajal probably produced the sustained downward deviation of the eye, by causing predominance of downward vestibulo-ocular inputs. This case also shows that thalamic aphasia and anterograde amnesia may be related to a paramedian lesion of the thalamus, with special reference to involvement of the dorsomedial nucleus, in the absence of lesion of the pulvinar and mamillo-thalamic tract and of conspicuous involvement of the ventral lateral nucleus.

35421947,"Ipsilateral blooming of microbleeds after Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker sign in an ischemic Stroke patient, a case report.","Saccaro, Luigi Francesco; Bekri, Imen; De Malherbe, Maxime; Hmida, Intissar; Pico, Fernando",Saccaro,"Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM) is a hyperintense subarachnoid signal on FLAIR MRI sequence caused by gadolinium contrast leakage into the subpial space. While, on FLAIR, HARM may mimic subarachnoid hemorrhage, it is differentiated from it on computed tomography (CT) and SWAN MRI sequences. Cerebral microbleeds are black, rounded spots on SWAN caused by blood-products deposition following red blood cell leakage from small cerebral vessels brain. Both microbleeds and HARM carry important prognostic implication as they are associated with blood-brain barrier disruption and an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. A 79-year-old man presented with aphasia and right hemiparesis due to ischemic stroke with left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Admission NIHSS score was 7, and he was successfully treated by intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. On day 1, his clinical condition worsened, and he had an urgent gadolinium-enhanced MRI. There was no evidence of early recurrence, nor of hemorrhage on SWAN or on FLAIR. Left middle cerebral artery was permeable. The patient was anticoagulated for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, and a second MRI following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure showed multiple left hemispheric diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintense spots and a left hemispheric sub-arachnoid hyperintensity on FLAIR, compatible with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This diagnosis was excluded by SWAN MRI sequence and a normal cerebral CT the same day. The diagnosis of HARM was retained. At day 9, patient's condition improved, and a control MRI did not show evidence of HARM. However, numerous microbleeds were detected in the left hemisphere only (ipsilateral with HARM and stroke). This case highlights first of all the importance of differentiating HARM and subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially in an anticoagulated patient with clinical aggravation. Secondly, it is crucial to identify microbleeds and understand their pathophysiology, as they are associated with higher risk of hemorrhage and stroke recurrence in ischemic stroke patients. Finally, the mono-hemispheric appearance of microbleeds in this case suggests for the first time that, in some acute ischemic stroke patients, a relationship between HARM and cerebral microbleeds may exist.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-02658-6,PMC9009060,Atrial fibrillation; Blood-brain barrier; Brain-blood-barrier disruption; Case report; Cerebral microbleeds; Cerebrovascular disease/Stroke; FLAIR hyperintense cerebrospinal fluid; Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker; Ischemic stroke; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It is particularly challenging to diagnose APS-related ICoVT because of the non-specific clinical manifestations and the frequent absence of typical neuroimaging. Moreover, there is currently limited knowledge on the clinical features and management strategies for the condition. Delays in diagnosis and treatment may lead to life-threatening consequences. We present a rare case of a 74-year-old Chinese woman who presented with sudden onset of headache and right arm weakness that mimicked acute ischemic stroke. Her initial computed tomography was unremarkable, and intravenous thrombolysis was performed. Serial neuroimages confirmed ICoVT 4 days after symptom onset, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was started at a dose of 0.4 ml twice per day, according to the 2019 Chinese guidelines. The workup for the predisposing causes of ICoVT revealed triple positivity APS. LMWH dose was adjusted according to the anti-Xa chromogenic assay. However, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and there was a progressive enlargement of the venous infarction despite treatment with anticoagulants. Transtentorial herniation developed on day 12, and decompressive craniectomy was immediately performed. The patient's symptoms did not improve significantly after surgery, and she remained aphasic and hemiplegic at the 3-month follow-up, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 5. ICoVT is a rare yet potentially fatal manifestation of APS, and its diagnosis and treatment are extremely challenging.

34555574,Transcallosal-Transchoroidal Approach for a Symptomatic Third Ventricular Cavernous Malformation in a Pediatric Patient: Surgical Video.,"Ferrarez, Carlos Eduardo; Bertani, Raphael; Pahwa, Bhavya; Perret, Caio; Batista, Sávio; Leal da Silveira, Roberto",Ferrarez,"Cavernous malformations of the third ventricle are rare, deep-seated lesions that pose a formidable surgical challenge due to the rich, surrounding anatomy. Despite the potential morbidity of surgical treatment, the possibility of catastrophic, spontaneous hemorrhage in this location is even more feared and aggressive treatment is warranted, especially if the patient had suffered previous hemorrhages and is currently symptomatic. We demonstrate this approach (Video 1) on a 16-year-old boy who presented with right-sided hemiparesis (power grade 4), intense headaches, difficulties with learning and concentration, and memory loss, mainly affecting short-term memory. The patient had a previous unsuccessful excision at another center 3 months after initial hemorrhage. The absence of hydrocephalus and medial thalamic location favored a modified transcallosal transchoroidal (or subchoroidal) approach. Due to the anatomy of the lesion, no other microsurgical approaches were considered. The surgery at our center (second attempt) was performed 5 months after initial hemorrhage. The head was placed in neutral position, with a slight elevation of the vertex and the midline in a vertical position. A callosotomy had already been performed during the patient's first excision attempt at another center. Although dissection through the tela choroidea is commonly performed medially to the choroidal fissure when one wants to enter the third ventricle, we chose to carefully dissect through this structure laterally, because this thalamic lesion extended almost into the ependymal surface of the third ventricle. This way, the choroidal plexus became a protective cushion for the fornix. On entering the third ventricle, a mulberry-like lesion was readily identified and the cavernoma was located. The central contents of the cavernoma were dissected initially, causing relative deflation of the lesion and more maneuverability to dissect it away from the surrounding structures. Neuromonitoring was used to avoid brainstem injury. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed complete resection with no signs of hemorrhage or ischemia. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5 with no new neurologic deficits. The patient was also able to return to school after 1 month and showed complete recovery. Unfortunately, neuropsychologic evaluation was unavailable to understand his improvement better.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that clinically typical capsular warning syndrome can be associated with pontine infarct and the term oepontine warning syndrome was coined. A 54-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was seen with profound left-sided hemiplegia. She had had 3 episodes of left-sided weakness before complete hemiplegia. Her speech was slurred. Left central facial palsy and hemiglossoplegia were presented. Her left plantar response was extensor and bilateral posterior internuclear ophthalmoplegia was seen on neurologic examination. Biochemical tests revealed hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia on the next day. MRI demonstrated an acute right paramedian pontine infarct. The patient was commenced on oral clopidogrel, atorvastatin and acarbose. After 23 days of hospitalization, she was discharged with severe left hemiplegia. 1) Pontine warning syndrome may be underestimated and understudied. 2) Posterior internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a rare clinical sign in cerebrovascular diseases, while it can help to locate a brainstem lesion rather than an internal capsular one. 3) Blood pressure lowering administration may be improper for patients with pontine warning syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-10-55,PMC2906430,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Conducting a formal neuropsychological evaluation concerning a patient's neurologic status during the chronic recovery phase can be challenging. Furthermore, the clinical assessment of survivors of penetrating TBI has not been adequately documented in the available literature. Severe TBI in patients can provide valuable information about the functional significance of the damaged brain regions. This information can help inform our understanding of the brain's intricate neural network. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 29-year-old right-handed man who sustained a left-hemisphere TBI after a gunshot, causing extensive diffuse damage to the left cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, mainly sparing the right hemisphere. The patient survived. The patient experienced spastic right-sided hemiplegia, facial hemiparesis, left hemiparesis, and right hemianopsia. Additionally, he had severe global aphasia, which caused difficulty comprehending verbal commands and recognizing printed letters or words within his visual field. However, his spontaneous facial expressions indicating emotions were preserved. The patient received a thorough neuropsychological assessment to evaluate his functional progress following a severe TBI and is deemed to have had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Research on cognitive function recovery following loss of the right cerebral hemisphere typically focuses on pediatric populations undergoing elective surgery to treat severe neurological disorders. In this rare instance of a favorable outcome, we assessed the capacity of the fully developed right hemisphere to sustain cognitive and emotional abilities, such as language.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.941601,PMC11180484,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Application of endovascular interventions is limited due to substantial brainstem compression and cranial nerve neuropathy. Combined endovascular exclusion and microsurgical excision provides an approach to treatment of these lesions. A 48-year-old female patient presented with progressive complaints of ataxia, diplopia in left lateral gaze, and dysphagia. Imaging studies (CT, MRI, angiography) revealed a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm of the right vertebral artery and pronounced brainstem compression. The initial phase of treatment involved endovascular occlusion of the vertebral artery and aneurysm trapping that did not lead to changes in the postoperative patient's neurological status. MRI demonstrated complete aneurysm thrombosis and a weak TOF signal in the vertebral artery near the proximal aneurysm neck region. Because of persistent brainstem compression, the patient underwent right suboccipital craniectomy and hemilaminectomy of the CI arch for aneurysm excision one week after endovascular occlusion. After isolating the aneurysmal sac, the vertebral artery was transected, and two small branches extending from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem were also coagulated and transected, followed by aneurysm excision. Numerous vasa vasorum in the wall of the proximal vertebral artery and aneurysm neck were coagulated to stop bleeding. After surgery, the patient developed neurological symptoms (right leg ataxia and dysphagia worsening) due to lateral medullary infarction (confirmed by MRI) that presumably resulted from coagulation of two small perforating branches coming from the aneurysm neck to the brainstem. Recovery of the patient's neurological functions was observed during conservative treatment. The patient was discharged with mild right leg ataxia and preoperative left-sided abducens paresis.

Twenty-three consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke attributed to embolic occlusion of large arteries of the anterior circulation who underwent treatment with surgical embolectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty patients were treated based on data from magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch, while three other patients had contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were treated based on computed tomography (CT) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings. Clinical outcomes, including recanalization rate, recanalization time, complications, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months, and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score improvement at 1 month, were evaluated. Among the 23 patients (median age, 80 years; median presenting NIHSS score, 21 points), the occlusion site was the internal carotid artery (ICA) terminus in six patients, the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 10 patients, and the M2 division of the MCA in seven patients. Final recanalization status was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 in 21 patients (91%). Median recanalization time from symptom onset and from start of surgery was 282 min and 70 min, respectively. One patient (4.3%) had symptomatic haemorrhage. Three patients (13%) had brain oedema due to massive infarction of affected vessel area; two of these patients had undergone embolectomy based on CT findings and had successful recanalization, while one patient underwent embolectomy based on MRI findings and did not have successful recanalization. All 18 patients who underwent embolectomy based on MRA-DWI mismatch and had successful recanalization did not develop additional confluent ischaemic lesion on postoperative DWI.

Except for Asperger's syndrome and an occlusion of a vein in her left eye she stated no other diseases or complaints, especially no cardiac problems. Postoperatively she developed neurological symptoms of left-sided hemiparesis and hemihypesthesia. A cranial computer tomography was performed and a right-sided infarction of the thalamic region was found. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm were detected 5 days later. The incidence of a PFO is given as 25% of the population. A paradoxical air embolism in the presence of a PFO is a feared complication in neurosurgical interventions in a semi-sitting or sitting position. Corpuscular emboli, such as bone, cement, fat or wound debris may be the reason for paradoxical embolisms in combination especially with partial or total hip replacement. The kind of embolism in the case described could not be clarified. Deep vein thrombosis or cardiac arrhythmia could be excluded. Therefore, it can be considered most likely that the operation site was the source of the embolism. The trigger for a paradoxical embolism is a reversal of the pressure difference between the right and left atria: normally the left atrial pressure exceeds the right atrial pressure by ca. 2-4 mm Hg, resulting possibly in a small clinically irrelevant left-to-right shunt. If the pulmonary arterial circulation is compromised and pulmonary vascular resistance increases, the pressure gradient between the left and right atria reverses and a right-to-left shunt can occur causing a paradoxical embolism. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation during anesthesia could be an important reason for a shunt reversal between the right and left atria and therefore favoring a paradoxical embolism but the pathophysiological role of PEEP has not yet been finally clarified.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Die Anaesthesiologie,10.1007/s00101-022-01094-y,,Acute ischemic stroke; Intracardiac Shunt; Patent foramen ovale; Perioperative complications; Positive end-expiratory pressure,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,ger

Case report.,"Parney, I F; Steinke, D E",Parney,"The authors present a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT) that occurred after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and they review the relevant literature. An immune-mediated syndrome, HITT is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia and paradoxical vascular thromboses. Although it has been estimated in prospective studies that HITT occurs in between 1 and 3% of patients receiving heparin, it is underrecognized in the neurosurgical literature. In the present case, a 49-year-old woman underwent clipping of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm after suffering a Hunt and Hess Grade III SAH. She had an uncomplicated postoperative course with good clip positioning and no vasospasm observed on a cerebral angiogram obtained on Day 7. On Day 23, the patient developed a right hemiparesis and experienced a grand mal seizure. A head computerized tomography scan revealed a hemorrhagic infarct in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Repeated cerebral angiograms did not show vasospasm. She was thrombocytopenic (platelet count as low as 46 x 10(9)/L on Day 28 compared with 213 x 10(9)/L on Day 1) and had been receiving heparin flushes to maintain intravenous catheter patency. An assay for HITT-associated antibodies was positive. The heparin flushes were discontinued and the platelet count recovered (121 x 10(9)/L). She improved neurologically, but was left with a significant right hemiparesis at discharge. This patient had assay-proven heparin-induced thrombocytopenia despite minimal exposure to heparin. Because there was no evidence of vasospasm or other factors to account for her delayed hemorrhagic infarction, an HITT-related disorder seemed most likely. Despite a large body of literature describing HITT in nonneurosurgical patients, only three previous neurosurgical cases have been published. This case report may serve to heighten awareness of this disorder.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.2000.93.1.0136,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, this sign should not point out straightforwardly to Parinaud syndrome, as other lesions in the central nervous system could cause it. The case of a 47-year-old woman showing acute onset of diplopia with bilateral upward gaze palsy is described. Parinaud syndrome was suspected on clinical grounds. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging displayed an acute ischemic lesion in the right anteromedial thalamus. Bilateral upward gaze palsy may be caused by unilateral thalamic infarction.

Treatment options for acute ischemic stroke continue to evolve and include pharmaceutical and mechanical therapies. With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of a new device for mechanical thrombectomy, the options available for treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been expanded. Thrombolytic therapy is generally given intravenously in the first 3 h and up to 6 h via the intraarterial route for pharmacological clot disruption. The maximum time-frame for mechanical thrombectomy devices has yet to be determined. A 78-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a dense right hemiparesis, leftward gaze preference and dense global aphasia. Eight hours after symptom onset, left carotid angiography confirmed a left internal carotid artery terminus occlusion. A single pass was made through the clot with an X6 Merci Retriever device. After a single pass, the vessel was reopened and normal flow in the left internal carotid artery was demonstrated. At the time of discharge, her neurological deficits had improved significantly. Furthermore, the final infarct area, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, was probably much smaller than it would have been if the vessel had not been recanalized. We report the use of a new mechanical thrombectomy device 8 h after onset of ischemic symptoms, with substantial subsequent improvement in neurological outcome. In selected cases, use of the Merci Retriever can result in improved outcomes beyond the traditional 6-h window used for intraarterial pharmacological thrombolysis.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuroradiology,10.1007/s00234-006-0073-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

We report on a patient with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and complete monoplegia due to LKA, which was mainly ascribed to injury of the CFT from the secondary motor area using diffusion tensor tractography. A 35-year-old male was struck by a car from the side during riding an autocycle and received direct head trauma as a result of falling to ground. He lost consciousness for approximately 1 month and experienced continuous post-traumatic amnesia after the accident. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3 and he showed quadriparesis including complete monoplegia of his left arm since the onset of TBI. The patient diagnosed complete monoplegia due to LKA after traumatic brain injury. He underwent conservative management for TBI followed by rehabilitation at approximately 2 months after onset. At 32-month after onset, weakness on left arm (Manual Muscle Test [MMT]:0) and partial weakness of left leg (MMT:3). Results of electromyography and nerve conduction studies of left extremities were normal. Motor evoked potential values obtained from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) were: right APB latency 22.3msec, amplitude 1.6mV; left APB latency 22.8msec, amplitude 1.5mV. After 2 weeks of administration of dopaminergic drugs for improvement of LKA, left arm weakness had recovered to level that permitted movement against gravity (MMT:3). Diffusion tensor tractography at 32-month after onset showed right corticospinal tract discontinuation at the pontine level and partial tearing of the left corticospinal tract at the subcortical white matter. In addition, the left CFT from the supplementary motor area showed partial tearing at the subcortical white matter. The LKA due to injury of the left supplementary motor area-CFT was demonstrated in a patient with complete monoplegia following TBI.

2291035,[Hematoma of the head of the caudate nucleus].,"Pedrazzi, P; Bogousslavsky, J; Regli, F",Pedrazzi,"We studied five patients with cerebral hemorrhage limited to the head of the caudate nucleus. This rare localization represents 11% of central nuclei hemorrhages. This entity has various clinical expressions; some are similar to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, others show the same manifestations associated with hemiparesis and neuropsychological findings, while still in others, the neuropsychological syndrome with speech, behaviour or memory disturbances predominates. Recovery depends on the patient's previous clinical status and on the presence of associated lesions at the time of hemorrhage. Typical warning signs, like headache, are often absent in the elderly and debilitated. Meningismus is explained by the intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage. Motor deficit, usually moderate, is probably due to impairment of the anterior portion of the posterior arm of the internal capsule. Destruction of the head of the left caudate nucleus, which is part of the circuit causing ""subcortical aphasias"", is responsible for non specific speech disturbances, that are however remarkably rich in semantic paraphasias. These dysfunctions could be caused by a ""cortical diaschisis"" as suggested by SPECT analysis. Memory dysfunction as a result of caudate lesion is questioned. However confusion and behavioural disturbances, like preservations, transitory mutism and self neglect, seem characteristic. As shown by cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies, these disturbances might represent a frontal dysfunction caused by the interruption of the dorso-latero-prefrontal and orbito-frontal circuits. When the hemorrhage extends beyond the head of the caudate nucleus, behavioural changes occur due to the involvement of neighbouring structures such as the thalamus, internal capsule, temporal lobe and nucleus accumbens. Caudate hemorrhages occur mostly in the elderly, often with long-standing arterial hypertension causing lesions of the lenticulo-striate arteries. Severe stenosis or complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with a fragile anastomotic circuit or angiopathies in younger individuals (particularly Asiatics: moyamoya disease) are less frequent, but they should be considered and investigated by arteriography. Vascular malformations are a rare cause and a relationship with amyloid angiopathy can only be suspected.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,France,fre

However, it has not been clearly elucidated so far. A 57-year-old male patient presented with complete weakness of the right extremities due to an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left basal ganglia. At three weeks after onset, the patient showed severe weakness of his right upper and lower extremities (Motricity Index [MI]: 28/100, finger extensor: 0/5). At 6 months after onset, his weakness showed some recovery, however, right finger extensor did not show any recovery (MI: 51/100, finger extensor: 0/5). At 9 months after onset, weakness showed significant recovery, particularly right finger extensor (MI: 64/100, right finger extensor: 3/5) and similar motor function persisted until 11 months after onset (MI: 67/100, right finger extensor: 3/5). The patient was diagnosed as the right hemiplegia due to ICH in the left corona radiata and basal ganglia. Clinical assessment, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were performed at 1, 6, 9, and 11 months after onset. Discontinuation of the left CST at the midbrain level was observed on 1-month DTT and the corona radiata on 6-month DTT. However, on 9-month DTT, we observed a CST branch originating from the left posterior parietal cortex and then connecting to the main truck to the CST at the thalamic level and thickened on 11-month DTT. On 1-month TMS, no MEP was evoked from the left hemisphere; on 6-month TMS study, MEPs were obtained at a right hand muscle (latency: 22.8 ms, amplitude: 130 μV) and its amplitude was increased as 300 μV with similar latencies on 9- and 11-month TMS studies. Recovery of an injured CST via an unusual pathway was demonstrated in a hemiparetic patient with ICH, using DTT and TMS. We believe that our results suggest that precise evaluation for an injured CST using TMS and DTT might be necessary, particularly in young patients, even after 6 months from onset even though the stroke patients show clinical characteristics of severe injury of the affected CST.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000014307,PMC6408056,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report CT perfusion findings in a patient presenting with postictal aphasia and right hemiparesis. A 62-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse, closed head injury and posttraumatic epilepsy, presented with acute onset aphasia and right hemiparesis. A non-contrast head CT scan demonstrated no acute hemorrhage. Left hemispheric ischemia was suspected, and the patient was considered for acute thrombolytic therapy. MRI revealed a subtle increase in signal intensity involving the left medial temporal, hippocampal and parahippocampal regions on both T2-weighted FLAIR and diffusion-weighted sequences. CT angiography and CT perfusion study were performed. The CT perfusion study and CT angiography demonstrated a dramatic reduction in cerebral blood flow and blood volume involving the entire left hemisphere, but with relative symmetry of mean transit time, ruling out a large vessel occlusion. Clinical resolution of the aphasia and hemiparesis occurred within a few hours, and correlated with normalization of perfusion to the left hemisphere (detected by MR perfusion). This unique case is the first in which clinical evidence of Todd's paralysis has been correlated with reversible postictal hemispheric changes on CT and MR perfusion studies. This is important because CT perfusion study is being used more and more in the diagnosis of acute stroke, and one needs to be careful to not misinterpret the data.",{},,Neuroradiology,10.1007/s00234-008-0362-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

She was well until 9 months prior to the present admission to our hospital, when she had an acute onset of left hemiparesis which turned out to have been caused by a thalamic infarct. Her hemiparesis showed nearly complete recovery during the next four months. She noted an onset of severe spontaneous pain and difficulty in using her left hand four months prior to the present admission. Neurologic examination on admission revealed an alert and well oriented Japanese woman. Cranial nerves were intact. Although she did not have weakness, her left hand showed thalamic posture, and upon standing, she showed a dystonic posture in which her left forearm took pronation and flexion at the elbow joint and her left lower extremity took extension in the knee joint and planter flexion in the ankle joint. Her dystonic posture increased during walking and disappeared in the supine position. She complained of severe spontaneous pain and tingling sensation in her left extremities. Position sense was diminished in her left leg. However other sensations were intact. She had slight ataxia on the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric, but the planter response was extensor on the left side. MRI revealed a small lacunar infarct involving the right posterolateral thalamic region. EMG with surface electrodes revealed non-reciprocal tonic discharges in the left biceps brachii and forearm flexor and extensor muscles. She responded poorly to various medications. Only trihexyphenidyl showed partial alleviation of her pain and dystonic posture. We thought her pain might be caused by dystonic contraction of the skeletal muscles, at least in part. We injected 25 IU of botulinus toxin as a total dose into her biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and wrist flexor muscles. A few days after the injection, her dystonic posture began to show marked improvement; as her dystonia improved, her pain also showed marked improvement. This patient appeared to represent a case of post-hemiplegic dystonia. Her pain was initially thought to be the thalamic pain. However, as her pain disappeared with improvement of her dystonia, her pain is most likely to have been caused by the dystonic muscle contraction.

Notably, the glioblastoma was located at some distance from the hematoma. A 42-year-old right-handed man presented with a sudden-onset headache, motor aphasia, and right hemiplegia. CT showed left putaminal hemorrhage and a mass lesion with a slightly high density in the midbrain away from the hematoma. Conservative treatment was initiated for the patient. Initially, we suspected a benign tumor-like cavernous malformation based on the CT findings. However, MRI showed ring enhancement of the mass lesion on contrast-enhanced MRI and hyperintensity on arterial spin labeling(ASL). A part of the wall of the putaminal hemorrhage also exhibited hyperintensity on ASL. Since we suspected a malignant brainstem tumor and a secondary intracerebral hemorrhage caused by this tumor, we performed a stereotactic brain biopsy. Histological examination revealed that the tumor was a wild-type <i>IDH-1</i> glioblastoma. In the acute phase, the intracerebral hemorrhage presented as a hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging. Therefore, it was difficult to distinguish hemorrhagic glioblastoma from an intracerebral hemorrhage. Even if an intracerebral hemorrhage is observed at common sites, it is important to consider the possibility of a malignant brain tumor and complete a prompt examination. In addition, ASL imaging may be useful in detecting hemorrhagic malignant brain tumors.",{},,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,10.11477/mf.1436204297,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of infarction in the left superior paramedian mesencephalic artery involving the vicinity of the periaqueductal gray matter. The symptoms rapidly resolved under the administration of anti-platelet agents. The precise location of the hypothetical divergence center of the ocular motor system remains unclear because the lesions responsible for divergence paralysis are rarely identified on neuroimaging. We emphasize that this is a first reported case of DP caused by acute midbrain infarction and speculate that the mesencephalic reticular formation may be partially involved.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",10.2169/internalmedicine.51.8443,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

We describe a patient presenting a left AH following a right pontine infarction. We investigated the ballistic flexion movements of both wrists and the associated agonist and antagonist electromyographic (EMG) activities, before and after addition of inertial loads. At the time of motion analysis, neurological examination showed cerebellar-like dysmetria of the left side but the patient had recovered a normal strength. In the basal state (without addition of loads), movements of the left wrist were hypermetric. The duration of the agonist EMG activity was prolonged and the onset latency of the antagonist EMG activity was not delayed. Moreover, when a mass was added, the hypermetria was unchanged because the patient was unable to adapt appropriately neither the agonist, nor the antagonist EMG activity. We suggest that the hypermetria was due to an imbalance between the duration of the agonist EMG activity (the launching force) and the duration of the antagonist EMG activity (the braking force).",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
930740,Neurophysiology of movement disorders.,"De La Torre, J C",De La Torre,"The relation of the cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia and their participation in movement disorders is presented. Studies have shown that lesions to the cortex will produce contralateral paralysis while damage to the basal ganglia or cerebellum will result in movement abnormalities. These data provide support for the view that subcortical but not cortical structures initiate the control movement activity. It would appear that the basal ganglia and cerebellum receive signals from the auditory, visual, and somatosensory cortex integrate this information, and relay signals back to the motor cortex, which in turn sends out efferent fibers to the motor neurons of the spinal cord. The electronic and neurophysiological basis of the somatosensory evoked responses (SER) test following peripheral nerve stimulation and sensory recording in human cortex is given. Control values of SER peak to peak latency waveforms from 66 normal volunteers show the practicality of this test. Preliminary results using SER in patients are discussed from clinical case reports. The subjects had mild to marked movement disorders secondary to Parkinson's disease, vascular occlusion, multiple sclerosis, and spino-cerebellar degeneration.

The surgical indications and technique are discussed in the context of an illustrative case and pertinent anatomic considerations. A 38-year-old man with acute right hemiparesis and bulbar symptoms had a left pontine hemorrhage with an associated cavernous malformation and venous anomaly. There was no pial or ependymal representation of the lesion. To avoid disruption of eloquent structures, the pia was entered in the posterolateral aspect of the middle cerebellar peduncle. Subsequent dissection was guided by stereotactic neuronavigation in a ventromedial trajectory along the course of the pontocerebellar fibers. The cavernous malformation was resected completely without procedure-related morbidity. The patient's preoperative deficits slowly improved to a functionally independent state. The lateral transpeduncular approach may be used to access intrinsic lesions of the rostral pons with relatively low morbidity. Stereotactic neuronavigation and intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring are important surgical adjuncts to guide dissection and lesion extirpation.

A 57-year-old right-handed man of Pakistani descent with history of genetically confirmed CADASIL, hypertension, and mood disorder presented to the emergency department via Emergency Medical Services (EMSs) after he was found down. Initial neurological examination showed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 7 (E2, V1, M4), left gaze deviation, pinpoint pupils, and left hemiplegia. His medications included antihypertensive agents and aspirin. He was intubated in the emergency department due to inability to protect his airway. Computed tomographic scan of the head revealed acute hemorrhage in the right pons (ICH score 2) with extension into the right cerebral peduncle, as well as enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles suggesting early obstructive hydrocephalus that required an external ventricular drain placement. He had no improvement of his clinical status, and eventually extubation and comfort care were pursued. He died 6 days after presentation. CADASIL vasculopathy, cerebral microbleeds, hypertension, and antithrombotic agents are factors that could be related to ICH in patients with CADASIL.

We recently encountered three patients with the abrupt onset of pure motor hemiparesis as the initial manifestation of primary or metastatic brain tumor. In each patient, early computed tomography demonstrated a nonhemorrhagic, right frontal, enhancing mass lesion. While the mechanism whereby brain tumor may present abruptly and simulate a stroke remains uncertain, these cases illustrate that pure motor hemiparesis can be the initial symptom of intracranial tumor.

Here, we report a case of contrast extravasation mimicking intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with intraventricular extension after intravenous thrombolytic treatment and computed tomography angiography (CTA). A 52-year-old man presented with right-sided hemiparesis and hypoesthesia. Initial non-contrast head CT was negative for intracranial hemorrhage and acute ischemic changes. He received intravenous treatment with tenecteplase 3.8 h after the onset of stroke. CTA of the head and neck was performed at 4.3 h after stroke onset. It showed no stenosis or occlusion of the carotid and major intracranial arteries. At about 1.5 h after CTA, the right-sided hemiparesis deteriorated, accompanied by drowsiness, aphasia, and urinary incontinence. Immediate head CT showed hyperdense lesions with mild space-occupying effect in the left basal ganglia and both lateral ventricles. The hyperdense lesions were reduced in size on follow-up CT after 5 h. Two days later, CT showed that the hyperdense lesions in the lateral ventricles almost completely disappeared and only a small amount remained in the infarcted area. Contrast extravasation into the brain tissue and lateral ventricles, mimicking ICH with intraventricular extension, could occur after intravenous thrombolytic treatment and CTA in a patient with AIS, which might lead to misdiagnosis and wrong treatment of the patient. The rapid resolution of intracranial hyperdense lesions is key to differentiate contrast extravasation from ICH on serial non-enhanced CT.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-024-03618-y,PMC11027420,Computed tomography; Contrast media; Intracranial hemorrhage; Intravenous thrombolytics,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

15128614,The human basis pontis: motor syndromes and topographic organization.,"Schmahmann, Jeremy D; Ko, Ryeowon; MacMore, Jason",Schmahmann,"Clinical-anatomic correlations were performed in 25 patients with focal infarcts in the basilar pons to determine whether pontine lacunar syndromes conform to discrete clinical entities, and whether there is topographic organization of the motor system within the human basis pontis. Twelve clinical signs were scored on a 6-point scale, neuroimaging lesions were mapped and defined with statistical certainty, and structure-function correlation was performed to develop a topographic map of motor function. Clinical findings ranged from major devastation following extensive lesions (pure motor hemiplegia) to incomplete basilar pontine syndrome and restricted deficits after small focal lesions (ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, dysarthria-dysmetria and dysarthria-facial paresis). The syndromes are not absolutely discrete, and are distinguished from each other by the relative degree of involvement of each clinical feature. Structure-function correlations indicate that strength is conveyed by the corticofugal fibres destined for the spinal cord, whereas dysmetria results from lesions involving the neurons of the basilar pons that link the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Facial movement and articulation are localized to rostral and medial basilar pons; hand coordination is medial and ventral in rostral and mid-pons; and arm function is represented ventral and lateral to the hand. Leg coordination is in the caudal half of the pons, with lateral predominance. Swallowing is dependent upon the integrity of a number of regions in the rostral pons. Gait is in medial and lateral locations throughout the rostral- caudal extent of the pons. Dysmetria ipsilateral to the lesion constitutes a disconnection syndrome, as it occurs when the hemipontine lesion is extensive and interrupts pontocerebellar fibres traversing from the opposite, intact side of the pons. The heterogeneity of manifestations reflects the well-organized topography of motor function in the human basis pontis, in agreement with the anatomic organization of the motor corticopontine projections in the monkey. Higher order impairments including motor neglect, paraphasic errors and pathological laughter result from rostral and medial pontine lesions, and may result from disruption of the pontine component of associative corticopontocerebellar circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh138,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, there are limited data on small thrombosed aneurysms as a possible cause of ischemic events. Three patients are reported who presented with acute ischemic stroke and in whom the initial imaging studies showed a small (<10 mm), unruptured, partially thrombosed aneurysm. In each case, the aneurysm location was confirmed by a conventional angiogram. In all cases, the aneurysms were found on the proximal middle cerebral artery, in the territory corresponding to the clinical symptoms of the stroke. The mechanism of middle cerebral artery embolic event was thought to be related to the thrombus within the aneurysm, causing subsequent embolization into distal related vascular territory. Two of these patients had craniotomy for aneurysm clipping; one was managed conservatively with medical therapy alone. Thrombosis of small, unruptured intracranial aneurysms should be considered as a possible cause of acute-onset stroke symptoms in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It is under-recognized in the current literature, and no guidelines currently exist for medical or surgical treatment of such aneurysms. Medical management is often decided on an individual basis.

We report on a patient with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who showed recovery of an injured CRP via transcallosal fibers, which was demonstrated by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). A 67-year-old man presented with complete paralysis (Medical Research Council: 0/5) of the left extremities at the onset of a right putaminal hemorrhage. At six weeks after onset, he presented with more severe weakness of proximal joint muscles than distal joint muscles (right shoulder abductor; 2-, finger extensor; 3+, hip flexor; 2+, ankle dorsiflexor; 3). Although his right hemiplegia had recovered well, he consistently showed more severe proximal weakness (right shoulder abductor; 3, finger extensor; 4, hip flexor; 3+, ankle dorsiflexor; 4) until 16 weeks after onset. On both six- and 16-week DTTs, in the left (affected) hemisphere, the CRP showed severe narrowing with discontinuation of the anterior fibers at the corona radiata on six-week DTT, however, the discontinued anterior fibers of the CRP were connected to the right cerebral cortex via transcallosal fibers on 16-week DTT. We demonstrated recovery of an injured CRP via transcallosal fibers in a patient with ICH.

A 19-year-old woman with a two week's history of mild fever suddenly lost consciousness, and was afflicted right severe hemiparesis, left mild hemiparesis and motor aphasia. A CT scan revealed bilateral thalamic hyperdense lesions and paraventricular small hematoma in the right hemisphere. Hematology showed marked leukocytosis (450,000/mm3), mild anemia and no coagulopathy including disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. Cytology showed myeloblasts with positive stain in peroxidase and negative in esterase both in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. These findings indicated M 1 type, myeloblastic leukemia without maturation, according to FAB (French-American-British Co-operative group) classification. CT scan on the second day demonstrated expansion of the hematoma in the right thalamus, and nine brand-new small hematomas in different locations. The patient deteriorated into brain death soon after this examination. The pathology of this case was supposed to be ""hyperleukocytosis"", which is defined as a leukocyte count greater than 100,000/mm3. Severe leukostasis due both to dense leukocytes and lack of mobility of the myeloblast brought about an increase in permeability because of local impairment of nutrition to the walls of the vessels. As a result, the following histological changes occurred: 1) cellular exudation into Virchow-Robin space, 2) the appearance of leukemic nodule, admixtures of leukemic cells and erythrocytes, 3) mechanical compression of the capillaries and venules by the enlarging mass of the leukemic nodules.

A 28-year-old woman presented with hemianesthesia associated with aphasia following a left insular lesion, subsequent to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain MRI Flair sequence revealed a high intensity signal in the left insular and frontal subcortical regions. Insular infarct was diagnosed, associated with hemorrhagic sequelae. Study of the normal and pathologic insular cortex suggest several implications of the region in somatosensory and language functions. However, the insular cortex has been mainly associated with central pain. Lasting objective hypoesthesia has been very rarely documented.

30168017,"Ramsay Hunt syndrome associated with solitary nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract, and vestibular nucleus involvement on sequential magnetic resonance imaging.","Inagaki, Akira; Toyoda, Takanari; Mutou, Masahiro; Murakami, Shingo",Inagaki,"Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) is an acute peripheral facial nerve paralysis typically accompanied by erythematous vesicular lesions of the auricular skin. The etiology is considered to be geniculate ganglionitis due to reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Encephalitis is a rare but serious complication of VZV reactivation. Clarifying the regional and temporal evolution of the lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would help with understanding the pathology of the lesion, but this information is lacking in encephalitis with RHS. Therefore, here, we reviewed sequential MR images in three RHS cases complicated by brainstem lesions. All the regions of the lesions represent specific neuronal structures-the ipsilateral solitary nucleus (SN) and spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract (STNT) in case 1; bilateral SN, ipsilateral STNT, and vestibular nucleus in case 2; ipsilateral SN and vestibular nucleus in case 3-and this seems to account for the persistent robust symptoms. Case 1 initially showed no abnormalities on MRI and cases 2 and 3 showed weak signals on the first MRI which subsequently plateaued. These observations suggest the timeframe within which it becomes possible to detect regional and temporal evolution, namely, that the distribution of the affected regions expands between weeks 2 and 5 after onset of facial paralysis. These observations and the findings of a literature review indicate that the SN, STNT, and vestibular nucleus are relatively prone to developing encephalitis after RHS.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neurovirology,10.1007/s13365-018-0673-x,,Brainstem encephalitis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Ramsay Hunt syndrome; Varicella-zoster virus,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Eight right-handed recovering hemiparetic or hemiplegic patients were studied using functional MRI. Results were evaluated for each patient to consider individual variability in original functional organization, neuroanatomy, infarct size and extent, treatment, age, and sex. The results were also pooled as a group for comparison with a control group of eight right-handed normal subjects. In six of eight stroke patients, extended activation in ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex was observed during paretic hand movements. Bilateral activation of the primary sensorimotor cortex was recorded in three of these six patients; ipsilateral activation alone was recorded in the remaining three patients. Only two patients had mild synkinesia. Furthermore, in two male patients, the paretic hand movements activated extended areas of ipsilateral premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, when compared with normal subjects. In two patients with left frontal infarction, profound activation in the right supramarginal gyrus and in the right premotor cortex was observed during the ipsilateral paretic hand movements. Synkinesia alone cannot explain the extent of ipsilateral activation in primary sensorimotor cortex.

15794843,Intraoperative motor mapping of the cerebral peduncle during resection of a midbrain cavernous malformation: technical case report.,"Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo; Lyon, Russ; Du, Rose; Lawton, Michael T",Quiñones-Hinojosa,"Brainstem cavernous malformations that seem to come to a pial or ependymal surface on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging studies may, in fact, be covered by an intact layer of neural tissue. For cavernous malformations in the cerebral peduncle, intraoperative stimulation mapping with a miniaturized probe can determine whether this overlying tissue harbors fibers in the corticospinal tract. In addition, intermittent monitoring with transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) helps to protect this vital pathway during resection of the lesion. A 20-year-old woman collapsed after a cavernous malformation in the left cerebral peduncle hemorrhaged into the pons, midbrain, and thalamus. She presented with right hemiparesis and left oculomotor palsy. The cavernous malformation was completely resected through a left orbitozygomatic craniotomy and transsylvian approach. Stimulation mapping of the cerebral peduncle with a Kartush probe (Medtronic Xomed, Inc., Jacksonville, FL) identified the corticospinal tract lateral to the lesion, and a layer of tissue over the lesion harbored no motor fibers. TcMEP monitoring helped to guide the resection, with increased voltage thresholds and altered waveform morphologies indicating transient impaired motor conduction. All TcMEP changes returned to baseline by the end of the procedure, and the patient's hemiparesis improved after surgery. Stimulation mapping of the corticospinal tract and intermittent TcMEPs is a safe and simple surgical adjunct. Expanded monitoring of the motor pathway during the resection of cerebral peduncle cavernous malformations may improve the safety of these operations.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1227/01.neu.0000156784.46143.a5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

30068811,[A case of painful seizure accompanying ictal paresis and homonymous hemianopia due to post-stroke epilepsy].,"Tanaka, Kanta; Hashimoto, Shuji; Harada, Yuzuru; Kageyama, Takashi; Suenaga, Toshihiko",Tanaka,"A 69-year-old female with an old infarct of the left parietotemporal lobe was admitted for the evaluation of suspected painful seizures accompanying ictal paresis. The painful seizure and ictal paresis involved her right extremities without convulsions, although intermittent tremulous movements were noted on the right upper extremity. She also showed right hemianopia during the seizure. Ictal scalp EEG demonstrated lateralized rhythmic sharply contoured delta activity intermingled with a large amount of spikes, sharp waves, and fast activity mainly on the posterior half of the left hemisphere. Ictal MRI showed restricted diffusion in the postcentral gyrus and dilatation of distal branches of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). <sup>99m</sup>Tc-ECD SPECT revealed hyperperfusion on the left parietal cortex. Treatment with antiepileptic drugs successfully prevented seizure recurrence, then she was discharged home. On the follow-up SPECT after 1 month, the abnormal hyperperfusion disappeared. MRI demonstrated resolution of the restricted diffusion and the MCA dilatation. Taken together with the EEG abnormality and the transient abnormalities in SPECT and MRI, we concluded that her seizures were epileptic and that her painful seizures likely arise from the left primary somatosensory cortex. The mechanism of ictal paresis would be attributed to some disturbed functional architecture in the left primary motor cortex leading to loss of normal motor function through epileptic interference by ictal discharges. The same mechanism in the visual cortex could be assumed for her ictal hemianopia. Painful seizure and ictal paresis each is rarely encountered, even more so the combination thereof. These ictal manifestations might be difficult to differentiate from transient ischemic attack or postictal paresis, and thus EEG is essential to diagnose this treatable condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001167,,epileptic negative manifestation; epileptic painful seizure; ictal hemianopia; ictal paresis; lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA),Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

The patients were 15, 16, 30, 36, and 38 years old at the time of GKS, respectively, and 3 patients were female. Four AVMs were located in the lobe of the brain, and the remaining AVM were in the thalamus. Between 2-12 years after GKS, patients developed progressive symptoms such intractable headache or hemiparesis and enhancing mass lesions were identified. Follow-up visits revealed the slow expansion of the hematomas and surrounding edema. Steroids were ineffective, and thus surgery was performed. Histology revealed organized hematomas with a capsule, but there was no evidence of residual AVMs or vascular malformation. After surgery, the neurological symptoms of all patients improved and the surrounding edema resolved. However, the hematoma continued to expand and intraventricular hemorrhage developed in 1 patient whose hematoma was only partially removed. GKS for cerebral AVM can be complicated by growing, organized hematomas that develop after complete obliteration. Growing hematomas should be surgically evacuated if they are symptomatic.

After slow motor recovery, the patient was able to move all joint muscles against gravity and demonstrated some fine motor activity at the time of DTT scanning (6 years after onset). Results of DTTs for the corticospinal tract (CST) in both hemispheres showed that the CSTs originated from the primary motor cortex, descended along the known CST pathway, and passed through lateral areas of infarcts in the pons.

Only the paramedial and intermediolateral territories were found to be mostly constant.",{},,Acta neurologica Belgica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
16426803,[Acute cardiovascular complications of cocaine. About two case reports].,"Debien, B; Clapson, P; Lambert, E; Lenoir, B; Perez, J-P; Pats, B",Debien,"Concerning any socioprofessional category, some addictive drugs like cocaine are responsible for many complications. The authors relate two case reports of young patients who suffered from cardiovascular accidents due to this drug. The first one was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke caused by carotid artery dissection and a leg distal vascular obliteration, the second one with a myocardial infarction with transient left ventricular dysfunction. Through these two case reports, the authors take stock of the pathophysiological and therapeutic knowledge of cardiovascular accidents after cocaine intake.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Annales francaises d'anesthesie et de reanimation,10.1016/j.annfar.2005.11.023,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
24602130,Memory impairment caused by cerebral hematoma in the left medial temporal lobe due to ruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm.,"Maeshima, Shinichiro; Osawa, Aiko; Yamane, Fumitaka; Shimaguchi, Hidetoshi; Ochiai, Ikuo; Yoshihara, Tomoyuki; Uemiya, Nahoko; Kanazawa, Ryuzaburo; Ishihara, Shoichiro",Maeshima,"Cognitive disorders, such as memory disturbances, are often observed following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. We present a very rare case where rupture of a posterior cerebral artery aneurysm caused restricted damage to the hippocampus unilaterally, and caused memory disturbances. A 56-year-old, right-handed man, with a formal education history of 16 years and company employees was admitted to our hospital because of a consciousness disturbance. He was diagnosed as having a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a left posterior cerebral artery dissecting aneurysm, and coil embolization was performed. Subsequently, he had neither motor paresis nor sensory disturbances, but he showed disorientation, and both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Although immediate recall and remote memory were almost intact, his recent memory was moderately impaired. Both verbal and non-verbal memories were impaired. Brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cerebral hematoma in the left temporal lobe involving the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated low perfusion areas in the left medial temporal lobe. We suggest that the memory impairment was caused by local tissue destruction of Papez's circuit in the dominant hemisphere due to the cerebral hematoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-14-44,PMC3975334,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
