There is some controversy concerning lesion site (fronto-parietal; parieto-temporal; posterior insula, additional subcortical nuclei) or necessary associated symptoms (hemiparesis/plegia, anosognosia, neglect, position sense deficit). We here present a patient who is unusual in many respects, that is: (1) he is a right-hander with somatoparaphrenia after a ""dominant"" left-hemisphere lesion associated with aphasia and ideo-motor apraxia, but also with right hemineglect. He thus has ""crossed"" somatoparaphrenia; (2) his delusional misidentification concerned the right leg and not the arm or hand; (3) he has no anosognosia; (4) his proprioception is disturbed for the leg only; and (5) the lesion site is very posterior, a left occipito-parietal haemorrhage without involvement of the frontal lobe or the posterior insula. We present this case together with the seven other cases of ""crossed somatoparaphrenia"" with and without aphasia we found since 1935 in the literature and discuss their relevance in relation to the above controversies.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-014-4101-z,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",Germany,eng

28114093,[Cotard's syndrome: Case report and a brief review of literature].,"Moschopoulos, N P; Kaprinis, S; Nimatoudis, J",Moschopoulos,"The term ""Cotard's syndrome"" is used to describe a number of clinical features, mostly hypochondriac and nihilistic delusions, the most characteristic of which are the ideas ""I am dead"" and ""my internal organs do not exist"". Besides, anxious and depressed mood, delusions of damnation, possession and immortality, suicidal and self-mutilating behavior are included. The first description of the syndrome was made in 1880 by Cotard, who presented the case of a female patient in a lecture. He originally named it ""hypochondriac delusion"", and some years later ""delusion of negations"", while it was named ""Cotard delusion"" after his death. In international literature, the terms ""nihilistic delusion"" and ""Cotard's syndrome"" prevailed over ""delusion of negations"" and ""Cotard delusion"". In the present study we report the case of a 59 year-old woman, who was admitted to our department after a suicide attempt, and who showed symptoms of Cotard's syndrome for about two years, namely depressed mood, hypochondriac and nihilistic delusions, delusions of immortality and damnation, suicidal ideation, severe psychomotor retardation, diminished motivation and tendency to stay in bed. She never took the medication she was prescribed, and at times she refused to eat. During her hospitalization, there was performed a full blood panel and medical imaging, that showed chronic ischemic infarctions, periventricular leukoencephalopathy and diffuse cerebral atrophy in MRI. All the other test results were normal. She was administered treatment with haloperidol, mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Gradually, her psychomotor ability, motivation and mood improved, she didn't express suicidal ideation, her delusions were less intense and she was able to question them, but they weren't eliminated. She was discharged in improved condition, after 44 days. Cotard's syndrome isn't mentioned in the current classification systems (ICD-10, DSM-5). In literature though, it has been divided into three types, according to the clinical symptoms: psychotic depression, Cotard type I, and Cotard type II, and three stages have been proposed: germination stage, blooming stage and chronic stage. It has been associated with various medical conditions, such as cerebral infractions, frontotemporal atrophy, epilepsy, encephalitis, brain tumors, traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, it has been associated with psychiatric conditions, such as mental retardation, postpartum depression, depersonalization disorder, catatonia, Capgras syndrome, Fregoli syndrome, Odysseus syndrome, koro syndrome. Several reports about successful pharmacological treatments have been published, both monotherapies with antidepressants, antipsychotics or lithium, and by antidepressant and antipsychotic combination treatments. The most reported successful treatment strategy for Cotard's syndrome is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), administration of which should follow current treatment guidelines of the underlying conditions.",{},,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,10.22365/jpsych.2016.274.296,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Greece,gre

31977238,The behavioral presentation of an individual with a disordered sense of self.,"Johnstone, Brick; Kvandal, Aimee; Winslow, Robin; Kilgore, Jocelyn; Guerra, Melissa",Johnstone,"There is increased recognition that the brain processes a ""sense of self"" (best understood as a sense of ""mineness"") in the right hemisphere association area and which can be distorted due to neurologic injury. Although there are numerous descriptions of types of disorders of the self (e.g., asomatognosia, anosognosia, mirror misidentification disorder, Capgras syndrome, schizophrenia), there are few descriptions of the subjective experiences of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who experience a reduced sense of self. This article presents a longitudinal case study of a woman in her early 40s with a primarily right hemisphere TBI and disorder of the self who had difficulties relating her experiences from the perspective of the self. Subjective interviews, neuropsychological test scores, and objective personality testing illustrate how she reported her experiences of a diminished sense of self, and how this sense of self improved over the normal course of recovery following the TBI. This case demonstrates clinically relevant information regarding how individuals with a reduced ""sense of self"" (i.e., ""mineness"") associated with a right hemisphere TBI may report their subjective experiences and perform on objective testing.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2020.1717622,,Traumatic brain injury; disorder of the self; right hemisphere parietal lobe; sense of self,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report a case of delusional companion syndrome in the absence of any organic brain disease, stroke, or severe brain injury, in a young female with schizophrenia. The patient is a 29-year-old G3P3 female, with a history of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, who, after recently losing custody of her children, presented to the pediatric emergency department for evaluation of her baby doll, which she believed to be her child because the doll wasn't eating or moving well. She became acutely agitated when providers declined to insert an IV line to hydrate the doll and required emergency treatment orders to de-escalate. The patient was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit and treated with oral aripiprazole 10 mg, before transitioning to her previous treatment of aripiprazole lauroxil at an increased dose of 882 mg monthly. By the end of admission, the patient grasped that the doll was a toy that had never been alive. This case demonstrates how delusional companion syndrome can occur in young patients with primary psychotic disorders, without a causative neurological insult, and can be treated with antipsychotics.

7846242,The Capgras and Cotard delusions.,"Young, A W; Leafhead, K M; Szulecka, T K",Young,"We explore the relation between the Capgras delusion (the belief that your relatives have been replaced by impostors) and the Cotard delusion (the delusional belief that you have died). At first sight, these delusions would seem to have little to do with each other, except that they both involve bizarre claims about existence (for self or others). On closer examination, however, there are other parallels. Here, we summarise similarities in associated impairments of face perception, and argue that both delusions reflect an interaction of impairments at two levels. One set of contributory factors involves perceptual impairment, or anomalous perceptual experience. The other factors lead to an incorrect interpretation of this, for which we offer an explanation in terms of attribution theory. Although the Capgras and Cotard delusions are phenomenally distinct, they may therefore represent attempts to make sense of fundamentally similar experiences.",{},,Psychopathology,10.1159/000284874,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

23103861,Delusions of death in a patient with right hemisphere infarction.,"Nishio, Yoshiyuki; Mori, Etsuro",Nishio,"Although a role for right hemisphere dysfunction has been hypothesized in Cotard delusion, it remains unclear which functions are disturbed. We report here the first known patient with unilateral right hemisphere lesions and delusions of death (1 of the 2 types of Cotard delusion). This man began to believe that he was dead after suffering a right hemisphere infarction involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as the thalamus. He had delusions of death in the context of both depersonalization/derealization and delusional misidentifications of people and places. Neuropsychological testing revealed left hemispatial neglect and deficits in general attention. The patient's sense of body ownership and face recognition abilities were preserved. This case suggests that abnormal feelings of familiarity, which have been implicated in several delusional misidentification syndromes, contribute significantly to the development of delusions of death. If this is true, affective processes involved in the identification of people and places and in the feeling of being alive may partially overlap, and these affective processes may be supported by the right hemisphere.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31827504c7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

It can occur in the context of both psychiatric and organic illness, and seems to be related to lesions of the bifrontal and right limbic and temporal regions. Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed brain lesions in patients suffering from Capgras syndrome. This case study reports the findings of a thorough diagnostic evaluation in a woman suffering from Capgras syndrome and presenting with the following clinical peculiarities: obsessive modality of presentation of the delusional ideation, intrusiveness of such ideation (that even disturbed her sleep), as well as a sense of alienation and utter disgust towards the double. These characteristics bring to mind the typical aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroanatomic investigation, through magnetic resonance imaging, performed on this patient showed alteration of the bilateral semioval centers, which are brain regions associated with the emotion of disgust and often show alterations in subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, neuroimaging allows researchers to put forward the hypothesis of a common neuroanatomic basis for Capgras syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, at least for cases in which the delusional ideation is associated with deep feelings of disgust and presents with a certain pervasiveness.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S47293,PMC3742348,Capgras syndrome; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; obsessive-compulsive disorder; semioval centers,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

She became convinced that her pet dogs and the plants in her garden had been substituted by identically looking ones.

Eye movement patterns were explored by selecting three specific areas of interest (AOI) involving the eyes, the mouth, and the face regions. In contrast with controls, YY showed a reduction in number and sum of fixation durations to the eyes (p<.01) and no differential SCRs (p>.05) to familiar vs. nonfamiliar faces. SCR and fixation duration to family members' eyes were significantly correlated (r=.77) in both YY and controls. Eye region exploration seems to be related to the autonomic reactivity elicited by the affective valence of familiar faces.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,10.1080/13546800600892183,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

16854594,Attributional style in a case of Cotard delusion.,"McKay, Ryan; Cipolotti, Lisa",McKay,"Young and colleagues (e.g. Young, A. W., & Leafhead, K. M. (1996). Betwixt life and death: case studies of the Cotard delusion. In P. W. Halligan & J. C. Marshall (Eds.), Method in madness: Case studies in cognitive neuropsychiatry. Mahway, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.) have suggested that cases of the Cotard delusion (the belief that one is dead) result when a particular perceptual anomaly (caused by a disruption to the affective component of visual recognition) occurs in the context of an internalising attributional style. This hypothesis has not previously been tested directly. We report here an investigation of attributional style in a 24-year-old woman with Cotard delusion (""LU""). LU's attributional style (and that of ten healthy control participants) was assessed using the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (Kinderman, P., & Bentall, R. P. (1996). A new measure of causal locus: the internal, personal and situational attributions questionnaire. Personality and Individual Differences, 20(2), 261-264.). LU showed a significantly greater proportion of internalising attributions than the control group, both overall and for negative events specifically. The results obtained thus support an association of Cotard delusion with an internalising attributional style, and are therefore consistent with the account of Young and colleagues. The potential brain basis of Cotard delusion is discussed.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Consciousness and cognition,10.1016/j.concog.2006.06.001,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Few reports have described patients with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis, and no cases of psychosis associated with this encephalitis have been reported. We report a patient with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis with Cotard and Capgras delusions who was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The patient was a 25-year-old woman. She exhibited disorientation, executive function deficits, tremors in the upper limbs, generalized athetoid-like involuntary movements, hallucinations, incontinence, and fever, which led to her admission to our hospital. Upon admission, she complained of Cotard delusions. Various diagnostic tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, antibody screening, and brain imaging, were unremarkable, except for positivity for serum anti-recoverin antibodies, non-specific general slowing on electroencephalography and decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the frontal and occipital lobes, and increased rCBF in the basal ganglia and pons on single-photon emission computed tomography. She was eventually diagnosed with encephalitis positive for anti-recoverin antibodies and treated with immunoglobulins and steroids. Her neurological symptoms improved temporarily, but three months later, psychiatric symptoms, i.e., suicidal thoughts and Cotard and Capgras delusions, were exaggerated. After ECT, her condition significantly improved. In conclusion, the present report suggests that pineal gland dysfunction due to anti-recoverin antibody or its cross-reactivity with neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins may contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis and that ECT can be a viable treatment option if immunotherapy proves ineffective. Additionally, decreased rCBF in the prefrontal cortex may be associated with the clinical features of Capgras and Cotard delusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1330745,PMC10850254,Capgras delusion; Cotard delusion; ECT; anti-recoverin antibody; case report; encephalitis; rCBF,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

11032619,Misidentification syndromes related to face specific area in the fusiform gyrus.,"Hudson, A J; Grace, G M",Hudson,"The ""delusional misidentification syndromes"" are a group of uncommon and varied disorders in which, in typical form, the patient thinks that a particular familiar person is someone else or a certain familiar place is a duplicate. Although first identified and considered a memory disorder by Pick, evidence in support of this has been difficult to identify. They have been most often seen in various psychotic and organic brain diseases but lesions have been generally diffuse although the right temporal lobe has been implicated. A patient was investigated who abruptly developed a disorder wherein she misidentified her husband as her deceased sister and claimed that her home was a duplicate of her real home that were typical of Frégoli syndrome and Pick's reduplicative paramnesia, respectively. A discrete area of brain damage, probably ischaemic, in this patient was seen on MRI in the anterior part of the right fusiform gyrus and a smaller area in the nearby anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri with associated parahippocampal and hippocampal atrophy. A high order nervous system function that is devoted to the identification of faces is located in the adjacent midportion of the fusiform gyrus and a similar locus for environmental scenes, termed the parahippocampal place area, is present in the bordering parahippocampal gyrus. The misidentification phenomena in this case can be explained by disruption of the connections of these highly specialised areas with the most anterior inferior and medial part of the right temporal lobe where long term memory and mechanisms for the retrieval of information that are required for the visual recognition of faces and scenes are stored.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.69.5.645,PMC1763428,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

It appears that our observation represents the first documented case of Capgras syndrome complicating ECMO. This incident emphasizes the potential hazards associated with right common artery ligature for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO).

This study tests this hypothesis and tries to understand whether focal lesions are as important in the etiology of RP as they are in other types of DMS. The computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 consecutive psychiatric inpatients with RP and another principal psychiatric diagnosis were compared with those of control patients without RP matched for age, sex, and principal psychiatric diagnosis. The scans were assessed blindly by a neuroradiologist using a previously published rating scale for the presence of lesions in 11 discrete anatomic areas. The differences between the 2 groups were examined statistically using log-linear analysis. Statistical analysis revealed that index patient cortical atrophy, cortical fissure enlargement, and deep brain atrophy distinguished the 2 groups significantly (P < 0.05).

Extensive neuropsychological testing was conducted with both patients, with particular emphasis on face processing and the understanding of reflected space. Both patients were also investigated with structural imaging techniques (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). Although the neuroimaging results were not strongly lateralizing for either patient, neuropsychological testing revealed striking right hemisphere dysfunction with relatively intact left hemisphere cognitive function in both patients. Of particular interest was the patients' dissociation on tests of face processing; one patient, FE, had significant face processing deficits while the other patient, TH, had relatively intact face processing. Further testing with TH revealed striking deficits in his ability to interpret reflected space. The results of the face processing tests are discussed in the context of current models of normal face processing, with particular emphasis on the affective component in face recognition. We propose that a combination of cognitive deficits underlie the mirror sign delusion, including perceptual, affective and reasoning impairments, and also discuss the contributions of cortical and subcortical lesions in these two patients and in delusions in general.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.3.239,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
