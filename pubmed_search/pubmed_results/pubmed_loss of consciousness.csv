30516602,Coma and Brain Death.,"Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Rabinstein,"This article discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients who are comatose and reviews the current knowledge on prognosis from various causes of coma. This article also provides an overview of the principles for determination of brain death as well as advice on how to avoid common pitfalls. Technologic advances have refined our understanding of the physiology of consciousness and the spectrum of disorders of consciousness; they also promise to improve our prognostic accuracy. Yet the clinical principles for the evaluation and treatment of coma remain unaltered. The clinical standards for determination of death by neurologic criteria (ie, brain death) are also well established, although variabilities in local protocols and legal requirements remain a problem to be resolved. Effective evaluation of coma demands a systematic approach relying on clinical information to ensure rational use of laboratory and imaging tests. When the cause of coma is deemed irreversible in the setting of a catastrophic brain injury and no clinical evidence exists for brain and brainstem function, patients should be evaluated for the possibility of brain death by following the clinical criteria specified in the American Academy of Neurology guidelines.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000666,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng

On the other hand, high-dose BZDs may lead to profound sedation and diminished brainstem functions that mimic other structural brain lesions as described in our case: a 70-year-old unresponsive woman. She was hypothermic and had rapid shallow breathing. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E1V1M4, with pinpoint pupils and absent corneal, oculocephalic and oculovestibular reflexes. Other physical exams, laboratory testing and brain imaging were unremarkable. After two doses of 0.4 mg naloxone and intravenous thrombolytics were given, there were no significant responses, and the diagnosis remained a mystery. The cause of her unconsciousness was uncovered when her husband found empty bags of 80 tablets of alprazolam and lorazepam. Her consciousness and brainstem reflexes improved dramatically after 0.25 mg of intravenous flumazenil.

The main clinical manifestation is bleeding, and thrombosis-related complications are rare. This article reports an 87-year-old woman with severe thrombocytopenia for more than 7 years. On day 6 in the hospital, the patient suddenly fell into a coma, and emergency head computed tomography (CT) displayed acute cerebral infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, brainstem, and left thalamus. Although thrombocytopenia is often associated with bleeding, there is still a need for vigilance against ischemic diseases. We analyzed the possible causes of acute cerebral infarction with thrombocytopenia and reviewed the literature. Our case is different from the causes of cerebral infarction reported in previous articles, so the relationship between thrombocytopenia and acute cerebral infarction needs further study.

38134114,A case report of near-missed heat stroke.,"Yeoh, Cheng Wooi; Law, Wan Chung",Yeoh,"Heat-related illnesses have protean manifestations that can mimic other life-threatening conditions. The diagnosis of heat stroke requires a high index of suspicion if the patient has been exposed to a high-temperature environment. Central nervous system dysfunction is a cardinal feature. Strict adherence to temperature criteria can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. A 37-year-old construction worker was brought in by his wife and coworker due to a sudden loss of consciousness while resting after completing his work. Due to challenges faced during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as well as language barriers, a detailed history from the coworker who witnessed the patient's altered sensorium was not available. He was initially suspected of having encephalitis and brainstem stroke. However, subsequent investigations revealed multiorgan dysfunction with a normal brain computed tomography and cerebral computed tomography angiogram. In view of the multiple risk factors for heat stroke, pupillary constriction, and urine color suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, a diagnosis of heat stroke was made. Despite delayed diagnosis, the patient's multiorgan dysfunction recovered within days with basic supportive care. There were no noticeable complications on follow-up 14 months later. Heat stroke can be easily confused with other neurological pathologies, particularly if no history can be obtained from the patient or informant. When approaching a comatose patient, we propose that serum creatinine kinase should be considered as an initial biochemical screening test.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000036676,PMC10735119,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

At the other end of the spectrum, some patients with cerebellar stroke may present in a moribund comatose state. In both patient groups, it is often unclear at what point surgical intervention should be considered either to prevent further neurologic deterioration or to try to salvage a meaningful neurologic recovery. In this review, we present clinical cases that illustrate decision points in the management of patients with acute cerebellar stroke, with emphasis on clinical and imaging characteristics. We conclude with an analysis of clinical decision making in the management of patients with space-occupying cerebellar stroke.

34814769,The MRI of Jahi McMath and Its Implications for the Global Ischemic Penumbra Hypothesis.,"Shewmon, D Alan; Salamon, Noriko",Shewmon,"Jahi McMath was diagnosed brain dead on 12/12/2013 in strict accordance with both the pediatric and adult Guidelines, reinforced by 4 isoelectric electroencephalograms and a radionuclide scan showing intracranial circulatory arrest. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan 9 1/2 months later surprisingly showed gross integrity of cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and upper brainstem. The greatest damage was in the white matter, which was extensively demyelinated and cystic, and in the lower brainstem, most likely from partial herniation that resolved. The apparent integrity of gray matter and the ascending reticular activating system may have provided a potential structural basis for the reemergence of some limited brain functions, while the white matter and lower brainstem lesions would have caused severe motor disability, brainstem areflexia and apnea. The findings indicate that there could never have been a period of sustained intracranial circulatory arrest. Rather, at the time of brain death diagnosis, low blood flow below the detection threshold of the radionuclide scan was sufficient to maintain widespread neuronal viability, though insufficient to support synaptic function. Her case represents the first indirect confirmation of the reality and clinical relevance of global ischemic penumbra, hypothesized in 1999 as a generally unacknowledged and possibly common brain death mimic.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of child neurology,10.1177/08830738211035871,,Jahi McMath; brain death; ischemic penumbra; magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

31447480,Syncope and Twitching at the Emergency Department.,"Scutelnic, Adrian; Prange, Ulrike; Jung, Simon; Heldner, Mirjam R",Scutelnic,"BACKGROUND Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a type of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. This case report elucidates features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis, focusing on clinical findings and outcome as well as on rarely reported sinus arrest and its pathophysiology. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old female patient presented at the Emergency Department (ED) because of twitching and an acute confusional state. Initial neurological examination revealed cognitive disturbance with disorientation, inattention, and amnestic deficits. While in the ED, twitching of the right arm was observed and shortly thereafter she experienced a sinus arrest. A temporary cardiac pacemaker was implanted. Laboratory investigations demonstrated mild hyponatremia and positive LGI1-IgG antibodies in serum. An initial head MRI was unremarkable and electroencephalography showed epileptic seizure activity starting focally in the left hemisphere synchronous with the intermittent twitching of the right arm. A seizure-suppressant therapy with levetiracetam, valproate, and gabapentin was initiated, as well as an immunosuppressive pulse therapy with methylprednisolone followed by a tapering oral regimen of prednisolone. Within a few days, the seizures ceased. One month later, neurocognitive test results were back to normal. At 2 years, mild depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were the main clinical problems, as well as episodic migraine-like headaches. CONCLUSIONS Repetitive focal dystonic seizures, confusion, amnestic deficits, sinus arrest, and mild-to-moderate hyponatremia are pathognomonic features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis. Sinus arrest may occur because of a direct pathophysiological dysfunction of the structures involved in autonomic cardiac rhythm control or as an ictal or postictal phenomenon. Early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are both of utmost importance for favorable clinical outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.916945,PMC6730258,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

30516603,Management of Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest.,"Seder, David B",Seder,"Because the whole-body ischemia-reperfusion insult associated with cardiac arrest often results in brain injury, neurologists perform an important role in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care. This article provides guidance for the assessment and management of brain injury following cardiac arrest. Neurologists have many roles in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care: (1) early assessment of brain injury severity to help inform triage for invasive circulatory support or revascularization; (2) advocacy for the maintenance of a neuroprotective thermal, hemodynamic, biochemical, and metabolic milieu; (3) detection and management of seizures; (4) development of an accurate, multimodal, and conservative approach to prognostication; (5) application of shared decision-making paradigms around the likely outcomes of therapy and the goals of care; and (6) facilitation of the neurocognitive assessment of survivors. Therefore, optimal management requires early neurologist involvement in patient care, a detailed knowledge of postresuscitation syndrome and its complex interactions with prognosis, expertise in bringing difficult cases to their optimal conclusions, and a support system for survivors with cognitive deficits. Neurologists have a critical role in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care and are key participants in the treatment team from the time of first restoration of a perfusing heart rhythm through the establishment of rehabilitation services for survivors.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000669,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Although the mechanisms remain unclear, intermittent hypoperfusion in specific vascular territories may explain these phenomena. A man in his 60s with vascular risk factors experienced recurrent episodes of sudden loss of consciousness. Initial imaging and tests were normal, excluding other potential causes. MRI revealed bilateral thalamic infarction and the presence of an artery of the Percheron variant. We propose 'thalamic warning syndrome' as a new term for this clinical presentation, characterised by recurrent transient loss of consciousness and a high risk of subsequent thalamic infarction.

Due to a rise in the patient's cholesterol, carbamazepine was replaced with oxcarbazepine. At a follow-up, the patient reported a recent episode with loss of consciousness. Unstable epilepsy was suspected and the oxcarbazepine dose increased. The patient had had a minor stroke shortly before the check-up. As part of the diagnostic workup, a 24-hour ECG was performed. On removal of the apparatus, the patient described an episode with loss of consciousness that same morning. The ECG showed asystole at that point in time due to total AV block. A pacemaker was implanted, and the patient has had no episodes since. The patient retrospectively reported recurrent episodes with loss of consciousness over many years. The diagnosis of epilepsy was convincing, but was the heart condition linked to her epilepsy, her medication or was it a separate entity?

It is associated with coma and can cause brainstem reflexes to disappear, simulating a brain death-like condition. When given intensive supportive care and time, patients can recover without residual neurological damage. We present a case of a patient with known spastic cerebral palsy who was found unresponsive with no signs of breathing. He was brought to the Emergency Department, intubated, put on the ventilator, and hemodynamically stabilized. Brainstem reflexes were absent and he appeared brain dead. During the secondary survey, an intrathecal baclofen pump was found at his left lower abdomen, with a swelling next to it. A baclofen intoxication was suspected. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and after 72 h of supportive care complete neurological recovery was achieved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Systemic baclofen intoxication can simulate a brain death-like condition. There is no reliable correlation between baclofen serum levels and central nervous system depression in case of an intoxication. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize a baclofen intoxication as a possible cause of coma and absent brainstem reflexes. Recuperation is spontaneous and can follow within days without residual damage.

Our objective here was to detail the features and outcomes in three patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to review the relevant literature. Description of three cases and literature review based on a 1973-2013 PubMed search. Three patients were admitted to our ICU with sudden-onset coma and respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunctions requiring endotracheal mechanical ventilation. Focal neurological deficits, ophthalmological signs (abnormal light reflexes and/or ocular motility and/or ptosis), and neuropsychological abnormalities were variably combined. Initial CT scan was normal. Cerebral MRI demonstrated bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction, with extension to the cerebral peduncles in two patients. Consciousness improved rapidly and time to extubation was 1-4 days. All three patients were discharged alive from the hospital and two had good 1-year functional outcomes. Similar clinical features and outcomes were recorded in the 117 patients identified in the literature, of whom ten required ICU admission. Bilateral paramedian thalamic stroke due to AOP occlusion can be life threatening. The early diagnosis relies on MRI with magnetic resonance angiography. Recovery of consciousness is usually rapid and mortality is low, warranting full-code ICU management.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-014-9962-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Only a few isolated case reports describe syncope on presentation. We report the first case of DAVF causing recurrent, progressive syncope in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. A female in her late 20s presented with a 9-year history of syncopal episodes and was found to have a DAVF. Syncopal episodes were exacerbated by positional changes, strenuous activity and emotional stressors. Symptoms occurred upon wakening and lasted for 2 to 3 hours before she was able to regain functionality. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no irregularities. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed abnormal serpiginous structures in the left jugular foramen which communicated with the ascending pharyngeal branch of the left external carotid artery. Cerebral angiogram disclosed a left jugular bulb DAVF supplied by the left ascending pharyngeal and left occipital arteries. The DAVF was successfully managed by progressive endovascular embolization with coils and Onyx 34. On clinical follow-up evaluation, the patient had no further episodes of dizziness or syncope. We present an atypical case of DAVF in a patient presenting with recurrent syncope. Only 4 cases of DAVF causing syncope have been reported, all in combination with other neurological symptoms. In comparison, we report a unique case of DAVF presenting solely with recurrent syncope, a previously undocumented finding in the literature. Our case adds to other reports of nonspecific DAVF presentations and highlights the importance of considering this etiology.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0000000000000322,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Bilateral absence of the cortical response (N20 potential) on median somatosensory evoked potentials, on days 1 to 3 after the return of spontaneous circulation, is widely considered as the most reliable predictor of poor outcome with a high specificity and a low false-positive rate. The authors describe the case of a young comatose woman after hypoxic injury because of cardiac arrest whose initial median somatosensory evoked potentials revealed bilateral absence of the N20 response associated with evidence of selective injury to both perirolandic cortices and basal ganglia on brain MRI. This patient made a substantial recovery associated with bilateral reappearance of the N20 potential and resolution of the neuroimaging abnormalities.This case revealed that an acute selective and reversible hypoxic injury to both perirolandic cortices may lead to a temporary loss of the N20 responses and an inaccurate prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest. It emphasizes on the importance of adopting a multimodal approach in the prognostic assessment of survivors of cardiac arrest.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,10.1097/WNP.0000000000000928,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, in the absence of neurological signs and symptoms, bradycardia and syncope are often investigated purely from the cardiovascular perspective and central nervous system-related causes may be easily overlooked during differential diagnosis. Here we report a case of a 69-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department after a fall. He had 1-year history of syncope and bradycardia with frequent ectopic beats shown on his electrocardiogram. He had no neurological symptoms. He was previously investigated as an out-patient and a diagnosis of idiopathic bradycardia with ventricular ectopic beats was made. On admission, cardiovascular investigations could not reveal the cause of his bradycardia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of his head showed a localized mass in left basal ganglia consistent with infiltrating glioma. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report demonstrating central nervous system-related bradycardia and syncope without other neurological symptoms.

Understanding the mechanism of recovery of consciousness in these patients will undoubtedly help clarify this issue. Recent research has underscored the importance of electrophysiological data in characterizing the state of the brain during this period of unconsciousness. Here, we investigated cortical electrophysiological recordings from a single TBI patient and discovered that high-frequency activity associated with the return of consciousness reappeared in a spatiotemporal fashion. We observed a shift toward higher frequencies first in the anterior cingulate cortex, and then later in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This finding suggests that recovery may originate in more internal cortices and progress to superficial ones. Although this observation occurred in a single patient, it points to a potential mechanism for recovery of normal cortical activity in the return of consciousness following TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2022.147903,,Consciousness; Direct cortical recordings; Intracranial electrode; Traumatic brain injury,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

16269899,Clinical management of the organ donor.,"Arbour, Richard",Arbour,"There is a critical mismatch between available organs for transplant and acutely or critically ill patients with end-stage organ disease. Patients who may benefit from organ transplantation far outnumber available organs. The causes for this imbalance are multiple. One cause is family refusal to donate. A second cause is nonrecognition or delay in determination of brain death. A third cause is donor loss due to profound cardiopulmonary and metabolic instability consequent to brain-stem herniation and brain death. Family refusal may be addressed by education, public awareness, as well as close attention to social, cultural and ethical issues, and optimal communication with donor families. Brain death may be consequent to traumatic brain injury, ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke, as well as massive cerebral anoxia/ischemic following cardiac arrest. Nonrecognition or delay in brain death determination may be addressed by clinician education and frequent clinical assessment to detect early stages of brain-stem herniation refractory to aggressive measures for control of intracranial pressure. Donor loss due to profound cardiopulmonary and metabolic instability may be addressed by aggressive, mechanism-based treatment for clinical instability based on affected body system, as well as measures to support metabolic activity at the cellular and tissue level in the brain-dead organ donor. This article explores cerebral physiology related to impending brain death and catastrophic intracranial pressure elevations. In addition, physiologic consequences of brain death are correlated with affected body systems and mechanism-based therapies to support organ function pending transplantation. Ethical/legal issues are explored as related to patient autonomy and optimal family outcomes. Effective family communication, astute clinical assessment, and optimal clinical management of the organ donor are illustrated using a case study approach, highlighting the role of the advanced practice nurse in donor management.",{},,AACN clinical issues,10.1097/00044067-200510000-00011,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Brief report of two cases.,"Corsi, Fabio Massimo; Gerace, Carmela; Ricci, Monica",Corsi,"Two patients with post-coma reactivation deficiency who showed a ""dramatic"" response to rotigotine therapy are described. They had suffered from prolonged coma due to lesions in the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area. The authors believe that rotigotine effect in these cases could be due to restoration of dopaminergic transmission in medial frontal areas previously ""de-afferented"" from the lesions. Some comatous patients may experience a prolonged difficulty in recovering a normal state of consciousness. This phenomenon may be due to dysfunction of amynergic activating pathways connecting brainstem to the frontal cerebral cortex. In particular, dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways from the mesencephalon to the frontal cortical areas may be responsible for clinical pictures characterized by preserved alertness and total loss of interactions with the surrounding environment; the so called ""waking coma"" cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v91i1.7659,PMC7569577,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Many disease processes disrupt the organization of intrinsic brain activity, but few pervasively reduce the amplitude of resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI fluctuations. We report the case of a female with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, longitudinally studied during the course of her illness to determine the contribution of NMDAR signaling to spontaneous brain activity. Resting state BOLD fMRI was measured at the height of her illness and 18 weeks following discharge from hospital. Conventional resting state networks were defined using established methods. Correlation and covariance matrices were calculated by extracting the BOLD time series from regions of interest and calculating either the correlation or covariance quantity. The intrinsic activity was compared between visits, and to expected activity from 45 similarly aged healthy individuals. Near the height of the illness, the patient exhibited profound loss of consciousness, high-amplitude slowing of the electroencephalogram, and a severe reduction in the amplitude of spontaneous BOLD fMRI fluctuations. The patient's neurological status and measures of intrinsic activity improved following treatment. We conclude that NMDAR-mediated signaling plays a critical role in the mechanisms that give rise to organized spontaneous brain activity. Loss of intrinsic activity is associated with profound disruptions of consciousness and cognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-016-8083-6,PMC5761656,Functional connectivity; NMDA receptor encephalitis; Resting-state; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Bradycardia and decreased blood pressure were also present after the beginning cough. Holter 24-hour electrocardiography monitor exhibited 65 episodes of asymptomatic sinus arrest more than 3 seconds. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed acute infarction in the bilateral medial regions and the right tegmentum of the upper and middle medulla oblongata. Cerebral angiography showed severe atherosclerotic changes in the vertebral arteries. These clinicoradiological findings suggested that a distinct topography of medullary lesions could cause a series of cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction.

The natural history of intracranial dural AVFs remains obscure. In many studies attempts have been made to evaluate the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage, especially as a function of the pattern of venous drainage: a higher occurrence of bleeding was reported in AVFs with retrograde cortical venous drainage, with an overall estimated rate of 1.8% per year in the largest series in the literature. However, very few studies have been designed to establish the risk of rebleeding, an omission that the authors seek to remedy. Presenting symptoms in the 20 patients (17 men and three women, mean age 54 years) were acute headache in 12 patients (60%), acute neurological deficit in eight (40%), loss of consciousness in five (25%), and generalized seizures in one (5%). Results of the clinical examination were normal in five patients and demonstrated a neurological deficit in 12 and coma in three. Computerized tomography scanning revealed intracranial bleeding in all cases (15 intraparenchymal hematomas, three subarachnoid hemorrhages, and two subdural hematomas). A diagnosis of AVF was made with the aid of angiographic studies in 19 patients, whereas it was a perioperative discovery in the remaining patient. There were 12 Type III and eight Type IV AVFs according to the revised classification of Djindjian and Merland, which meant that all AVFs in this study had retrograde cortical venous drainage. The mean duration between the first hemorrhage and treatment was 20 days. Seven patients (35%) presented with acute worsening during this delay due to radiologically proven early rebleeding. Treatment consisted of surgery alone in 10 patients, combined embolization and surgery in eight, embolization only in one, and stereotactic radiosurgery in one. Three patients died, one worsened, and in 16 (80%) neurological status improved, with 15 of 16 AVFs totally occluded on repeated angiographic studies (median follow up 10 months). The authors found that AVFs with retrograde cortical venous drainage present a high risk of early rebleeding (35% within 2 weeks after the first hemorrhage), with graver consequences than the first hemorrhage. They therefore advocate complete and early treatment in all cases of AVF with cortical venous drainage revealed by an ICH.",{},,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/jns.1999.90.1.0078,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

It has an immune-mediated pathophysiology and is associated with antibodies directed against both the tumor and limbic structures in the nervous system. Here, we report a case of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis with an unusual presentation with initial symptoms of panhypopituitarism. A 28-year-old Caucasian man with history of testicular cancer in remission for almost 2 years was admitted to our hospital for altered mental status, syncope, vertical gaze palsy, ataxia, and tremor. Three months prior to admission, he began to have initial symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and hypogonadism. A few weeks before admission, he also developed worsening neurological symptoms that led him to present to the hospital. While hospitalized, he had an episode of syncope. Evaluation of his syncope revealed that he was hypovolemic due to polyuria, concerning for diabetes insipidus. While the patient did not meet criteria for diabetes insipidus, further endocrine laboratory testing to evaluate his central hormonal axes revealed panhypopituitarism. He also underwent a neurologic work-up with brain magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture, with results consistent with encephalitis. He received high-dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, which did not significantly improve his physical examination or mental status. Extensive testing did not show any recurrence of his testicular cancer. Paraneoplastic antibodies were also ordered, with anti-Ma2 antibodies eventually returning positive, consistent with anti-Ma2 paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is often a difficult diagnosis due to its variable presentation and timeline of presentation, leading to delays in both diagnosis and treatment. While paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis usually presents with neurological symptoms, it may also present with panhypopituitarism. A high index of suspicion is warranted for paraneoplastic syndromes in patients with history of malignancy, even if the malignancy is in remission.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-022-03603-4,PMC9524132,Case report; Limbic encephalitis; Panhypopituitarism; Paraneoplastic syndrome; Testicular cancer,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This includes profound lethargy and coma, loss of basic brainstem reflexes and pupil reactivity, myoclonic jerks and seizures, and a burst suppression pattern on EEG. In the absence of a clear history of ingestion, clinicians may presume the presence of anoxic brain injury and that a progression towards brain death may be imminent. CASE REPORT We report a case of a middle-aged woman found unresponsive who presented with apnea, loss of rudimentary neurologic findings on physical exam, burst suppression EEG findings, and a prolonged comatose state for nearly 48 h, followed by rapid resolution of symptoms secondary to a supratherapeutic baclofen ingestion. CONCLUSIONS Baclofen toxicity can present both clinically and with EEG abnormalities consistent with anoxic brain injury, suggesting an inevitable progression to brain death. When provided with appropriate supportive care and prolonged observation, improvement with full neurologic recovery is often seen despite the initial grim clinical picture.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936280,PMC8978149,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, the patient responded to certain auditory stimuli and motor imagery, suggesting that he retained some intact auditory and motor cortical functions. fMRI scans after 3 months of treatment showed increased activation of brain areas corresponding to task instructions. fMRI could be used to observe the effects of amantadine on brain function, and to aid the diagnosis and prognostic prediction in VS patients in terms of recovery and rehabilitation planning.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,The Journal of international medical research,10.1177/0300060518814127,PMC6381504,Vegetative state; amantadine; brain function; fMRI; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, literature is limited in illustrating the use of an early, aggressive program with an added focus on dynamic and active upright mobilization. The purpose of this case report is to describe a two-week aggressive, upright standing and walking program with an individual with traumatic brain injury in an acute inpatient rehabilitation setting. The case investigates the association between aggressive mobilization with changes in level of consciousness and daily cognitive, motor and communicative behaviours. A 30-year-old male classified in DOC as minimally conscious state (MCS) participated in an early upright mobilization program. The two-week intervention consisted of aggressive static/passive and dynamic/active upright mobilization activities, involving a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. Expressive communication, motor responses and current level of consciousness were monitored and assessed twice a day. Additionally, the patient's activation and arousal were subjectively monitored during daily therapy sessions. Following the dynamic/active mobilization activities, the patient demonstrated improved expressive communication, motor scores and increased activation and arousal during the mobilizations. After the two-week intervention, he emerged from DOC. This case report illustrates intense, more active/dynamic upright mobilization with the use of assisted technologies provides promise as an effective intervention for improving communication, motor responses, arousal and level of consciousness in a patient in MCS. Initiating upright, active activity sooner in the recovery process, may lead to improved outcomes and quicker emergence.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAggressive upright mobilization may be delivered safely to patients in DOC early in their rehabilitative care.Aggressive upright mobilization may be beneficial for patients in DOC.Higher intensity, more active/dynamic upright mobilization such as the use of Erigo<sup>®</sup>Pro + stepping and locomotor training on a treadmill with body weight support demonstrated positive outcomes with expressive communication, motor responses and arousal.Earlier initiation of aggressive mobilization may promote recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Disability and rehabilitation.

Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the evolution of one VS patient at one month post-ictus and again twelve months later when he had recovered consciousness. fMRI was used to investigate cortical responses to passive language stimulation as well as task-induced deactivations related to the default-mode network. DTI was used to assess the integrity of the global white matter and the arcuate fasciculus. We also performed a neuropsychological assessment at the time of the second MRI examination in order to characterize the profile of cognitive deficits. fMRI analysis revealed anatomically appropriate activation to speech in both the first and the second scans but a reduced pattern of task-induced deactivations in the first scan. In the second scan, following the recovery of consciousness, this pattern became more similar to that classically described for the default-mode network. DTI analysis revealed relative preservation of the arcuate fasciculus and of the global normal-appearing white matter at both time points. The neuropsychological assessment revealed recovery of receptive linguistic functioning by 12-months post-ictus. These results suggest that the combination of different structural and functional imaging modalities may provide a powerful means for assessing the mechanisms involved in the recovery from the VS.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-10-77,PMC2941677,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Conversely, loss of consciousness due to anterior circulation involvement (e.g., middle cerebral artery [MCA]) is a rare occurrence in TIA. This report describes a rare case in a 59-year-old woman who experienced recurrent episodes of altered consciousness because of the occlusion or stenosis of her MCAs. The diagnosis of the case was updated from TIA to acute cerebral infarction, finally. Following initial loss of consciousness, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any evidence of acute cerebral infarction. However, following the second and third episodes of unconsciousness, the MRI revealed multiple new acute cerebral infarcts affecting both the cerebral hemispheres. Further evaluation through digital subtraction angiography disclosed complete occlusion of the left MCA and severe stenosis of the right MCA. Early in her illness, the patient was treated with vasodilators, aspirin and atorvastatin. Finally, 2 stents in her right and left MCAs were placed respectively, followed by treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel, and double-dosed atorvastatin calcium. Meanwhile, the patient focused on avoiding conditions which may lead to dehydration in her daily life routine. The episodes of unconsciousness of this patient were completely resolved. During the 1-year postoperative follow-up, the patient remained clinically stable without any symptoms of unconsciousness, limb numbness or weakness, or dizziness. These findings suggested that hypoperfusion in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres played a pivotal role in precipitating the patient episodes of unconsciousness. This case underscores the possibility that occlusion or severe stenosis in both MCAs can contribute to recurrent episodes of unconsciousness due to hypoperfusion. Moreover, it emphasizes the association between these episodes of unconsciousness and an increased risk of subsequent ischemic stroke.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000037343,PMC10919491,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Recently, a paradoxical arousing effect of zolpidem in patients with severe brain damage has been repeatedly reported. A placebo-controlled magnetic resonance study was conducted to evaluate its effect on BOLD and metabolites spectral signals in a patient with severe brain injuries and an age-matched healthy volunteer. A multi-modal analysis was used to assess aspects in the pharmacologically-induced changes in the resting-state brain metabolism. A significantly increased BOLD signal was transiently localized in the left frontal cortices, bilateral anterior cingulated areas, left thalamus and right head of the caudate nucleus. The healthy subject showed a deactivation of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. BOLD signal changes were found to significantly correlate with concentrations of extravascular metabolites in the left frontal cortex. It is discussed that, when zolpidem attaches to modified GABA receptors of neurodormant brain cells, brain activation is induced. This might explain the significant correlations of BOLD signal changes and proton-MRS metabolites in this patient after zolpidem. It was concluded that proton-MRS and BOLD signal assessment could be used to study zolpidem-induced metabolic modulation in a resting state.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.794961,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The Functional Communication Measures (FCM) consists of a series of rating scales, ranging from 1 (least functional) to 7 (most functional), assessing cognitive requirements for communication and communicative abilities in patients with brain injury. Here we presented exploratory data concerning an Italian adaptation of FCM administered to patients with sABI. After the translation into Italian language, the FCM was blindly administered by 2 independent speech therapists to 19 patients (10 males; median age = 58; IQR = 25) admitted to neurorehabilitation unit after sABI with a level of cognitive functioning between 4 and 8. Two further patients who presented a pDoC after sABI and emerged from the minimally conscious state (a 64-year-old female and a 74-year-old female) were also evaluated by means of the FCM, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, and the Disability Rating Scale. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect for attention, memory, and swallowing items, and substantial for communicative-augmentative communication, motor speech, spoken language expression, and spoken language comprehension. Importantly, in the two pDoC patients, the FCM identified two different functioning profiles in the attention, swallowing, motor speech, and spoken language expression scales, notwithstanding the two patients achieved the same scores on scales for functional disability and consciousness level. The FCM might be a promising and easy-to-administer tool to assess communicative functions in patients with sABI, independently from evaluation of functional disability.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-06173-x,,Acquired brain injury; Diagnosis; Disorders of consciousness; Functional Communication Measures; Language; Rehabilitation,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

This case report describes a Vietnam War era setting in which a traumatic blast wave struck the posterior cranium in the region of the foramen magnum, occipital crest, and other skull openings (orbit, oronasal, and ear) and the unique secondary clinical signs and symptoms experienced over time. This case report describes secondary delayed-onset clinical signs and symptoms consistent with progressive decades-long physical and functional complications. The traumatic blast resulted in brief unconsciousness, decreased vision in left eye, confusion, right sided hemotympanum, deafness, severe tinnitus, severe nasopharynx pain and difficulty swallowing, pain in right posterior and occipital area of the head, and loss of dental amalgams. Subsequent exams revealed progressive hyperacusis, sea sickness, dysdiadochokinesis, diagnosis of 9th and 10th cranial nerve traumatic schwannomas, hyperdense changes to the frontal lobe white matter, progressive tinnitus, chronic vertigo, right-sided high-frequency hearing loss, progressive oculo-gyric crisis of Tumarkin-like seizures, left-sided chronic vitreous hemorrhage, and diminished right hemisphere performance of the brain based on neurophysiological assessment.

The mechanism usually involves a combination of decreased venous return, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and secondary hypocapnia, all resulting in cerebral arterial vasoconstriction. Cough syncope has not in the past been associated with occlusive cerebrovascular disease. We describe a 50-year-old man with a 6-month history of episodes of loss of consciousness during paroxysms of coughing. Physical examination showed asymmetrical upper extremity blood pressures and carotid and subclavian artery bruits. Pulmonary function studies were normal. Ultrasound and angiography showed total occlusion of the left common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, and right vertebral artery; tight stenosis of the right subclavian artery; and a hypoplastic left vertebral artery. The patient had a left subclavian-to-left common carotid artery bypass and has had no syncope since that time.

TBI may affect emotional, sensory-motor, cognitive, and psychological functions with a consequent worsening of both patient and his/her caregiver's quality of life. In recent years, technological innovations allowed the development of new, advanced sensory stimulation systems, such as Neurowave, to further stimulate residual cognitive abilities and, at the same time, evaluate residual cognition. An 69-year-old Italian man entered our neurorehabilitation unit with a diagnosis of minimally conscious state following severe TBI. He breathed spontaneously via tracheostomy and was fed via percutaneous gastrostomy. At the neurological examination, the patient showed severe tetraparesis as he showed fluctuating alertness and responsiveness to external stimuli and opened the eyes without stimulation. Patient was affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage and frontotemporal bilateral hematoma, which were surgically treated with decompressive craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty about 6 months before. The patient underwent a neuropsychological and clinical evaluation before (T0) and after a conventional rehabilitation cycle (T1), and after a Neurowave emotional stimulation-supported rehabilitative cycle (T2). Following conventional rehabilitation (T1), the patient achieved a partial improvement in behavioral responsiveness; there was also a mild improvement in the caregiver's distress. Conversely, Neurowave emotional stimulation session determined (at T2) a significant improvement of the patient's behavioral responsiveness, cognition, and in the caregiver's distress. The P300 recording in response to the NES showed a significant change of P300 magnitude and latency. Our data suggest that emotional-integrated sensory stimulation using adequate visual stimuli represents a beneficial, complementary rehabilitative treatment for patients in minimally conscious state following a severe TBI. This may occur because stimuli with emotional salience can provide a reliable motivational resource to stimulate motor and cognitive recovery following severe TBI.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000026685,PMC8341226,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Macroscopic thinning of the gray matter and uniformly cheesecake-like cloudy changes in white matter were observed. Microscopically, cortical laminar necrosis was observed in all lobes of the cerebrum, and massive gliosis was diffused throughout the white matter.

All eight patients were male, aged from 21 to 66 years old. All eight patients received surgical treatment and exhibited impaired consciousness before lumbar drainage, and five (62.5%) also underwent decompressive craniectomy. The average drainage speed in these patients varied from 8.3 mL/h to 20.0 mL/h, demonstrating an inverse correlation with the latency period of brain herniation after initiation of the drainage (p=0.017). Four (50.0%) patients experienced cardiopulmonary instability at the onset of cerebral herniation, requiring immediate resuscitation. After drainage clamping and supportive treatment, seven (87.5%) patients displayed complete reversal of cerebral herniation within 48 h. Cerebral herniation induced by continuous lumbar drainage is mostly reversible if early identification and prompt management are realized.

MRI showed an intramedullary cervical tumor with a solid portion extended from C1 to C3 surrounded by a cystic portion. A macroscopic complete resection was performed and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ependymoma. Postoperatively, the patient's neuropathic pain and postural dizziness worsened, with syncopal attack while upright because of severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). On physical examination, her supine systolic blood pressure was 130 mmHg and fell to 80 mmHg while sitting with no change in heart rate. We found motor palsy of the left arm, bilateral ataxia, and urinary retention. Three months later, the patient was still bedridden, notably because of the OH. After 6 months, with the association of preventative measures of OH and high doses of a direct alpha1-adrenoreceptor agonist, a vasoconstricting agent, the patient recovered an independent gait permitting her to walk unassisted. The main causes of OH include medication, nonneurogenic causes such as cardiac insufficiency, and central or peripheral neurogenic causes such as diabetic insufficiency. Brainstem tumors are known to provide severe OH but this symptom has been seldom described in a purely spinal cord lesion.

To date, an increase of nicotine intoxication following an accidental or intentional ingestion/injection of refill solution (e-liquid) has been detected. A 23-year-old man presented with sudden loss of consciousness, bradycardia, and respiratory muscle paralysis after intentional ingestion of e-liquid. Early clinical data, brain computed tomography, and neurophysiological tests (electroencephalogram [EEG] and somatosensory evoked potentials [SEPs]) did not show features with a poor neurological prognostic meaning of an hypoxic encephalopathy. After 4 days, the patient showed bilateral loss of the pupillary reflex, and severe and cytotoxic edema was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. SEPs showed a bilateral loss of cortical responses and EEG a suppressed pattern. Nine days after the onset of coma, the patient evolved toward brain death (BD). Because nicotine intoxication might cause respiratory muscle paralysis, without cardiac arrest (CA), it would be important to understand the mechanisms underlying brain damage and to take into account that the current neurological prognostic evidence for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, based on data from patients who all experienced CA may not be reliable. Reporting cases of nicotine intoxication through e-liquid is relevant in order to improve regulatory parameters for e-liquid sale.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Brain and behavior,10.1002/brb3.1744,PMC7507521,brain death; cotinine; e-liquid; nicotine,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

3396208,Somatosensory and brainstem auditory evoked potential studies in nontraumatic coma.,"Ganji, S; Peters, G; Frazier, E",Ganji,"We believe that somatosensory and brainstem auditory evoked response studies help in the understanding of the dysfunction of the ascending sensory pathyways at various levels. In some patients where EEGs showed a significant contamination of muscle and background noise, the SEP studies helped to identify the level of dysfunction. The severity of the clinical condition (GCS score) correlated significantly (p = 0.003) with the prolongation of the CCT. Asymmetries in CCTs were more frequent in the stroke group than in the other groups. The presence of asymmetries in CCT in diffuse encephalopathies indicated a variable degree of dysfunction in the ascending sensory pathways, which clinically were not easily identifiable. This fact raised the possibility of either pre-existing lesion(s) or recent insult(s) such as ischemia. The presence or absence of N20 appeared to influence the duration of survival in subgroups. Some degree of difference in duration of survival was noted among the metabolic group with and without N20 potential. The subset of patients with N20 potential survived relatively longer than the group without it. A suggestion of influence was seen in the stroke group, but caution must be exercised because the absence of N20 was compatible with survival. The hypoxic group did not show any difference. A combination of prolonged interpeak EP-N13 and N13-N20 indicated a poor prognosis. A distinct absence of Wave I in BAER limited its usefulness on some occasions. A combination of abnormal interpeak III-V and abnormal CCT seemed to suggest a poor prognosis. Although death generally occurred earlier in the stroke group, age did not seem to influence the mortality in the first 10 days. Similarly, the cause of death also did not seem to influence the course in those 10 days.

Despite low-grade histologic features, the clinical outcome in reported cases was poor. A 61-year-old woman presented to our institution with a history of syncope. On presentation, she was alert and oriented, and her systemic examination was unremarkable. Computed tomographic scan showed a well-circumscribed, slightly hyperdense mass with calcification and a cystic component in the anterior part of the third ventricle. The mass was homogenously enhancing after the intravenous administration of contrast material, and its maximum diameter was 3.5 cm. The preoperative diagnosis was craniopharyngioma. Because the tumor seemed to invade the hypothalamus bilaterally, the operative plan was to reduce the tumor volume, followed by radiosurgery. The patient underwent partial removal of the tumor via a bifrontal basal interhemispheric approach. The histologic and immunohistochemical findings indicated CG. Surprisingly, tumor cells showed NFP expression. The residual tumor was treated by GKRS and showed no regrowth at 1-year follow-up. Chordoid glioma is considered a glial neoplasm with distinct morphological and clinicopathologic features, but there may also be other unknown characteristics because of its rarity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of CG with calcification and, at the same time, the second case with NFP expression in the English literature. Calcification and expression of NFP should not exclude CG in the differential diagnosis of a third ventricular tumor. The authors also suggest that the combination of microsurgery and GKRS is a safe and effective treatment strategy for CG.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Surgical neurology,10.1016/j.surneu.2007.07.032,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient participated in 28 sessions that were videotaped for later behavioral analysis. During all sessions, measures were taken of pulse rate, respiration rate, and skin resistance. Visual inspection of the data and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) analyses revealed greater increases in responsiveness with the presentation of taped voices of family and friends than with other types of taped stimuli. Behavioral observations of body movements and measures of pulse rate were superior to observations of facial expressions and measures of respiration rate and galvanic skin response in revealing changes in responsiveness.

Both were unaware when first seen at 3 months post-injury, but both have made useful functional recovery.

To study five patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with different behavioural features, we employed [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), MRI and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. Each patient's brain expressed a unique metabolic pattern. In three of the five patients, co-registered PET/MRI correlate islands of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behaviour. Two patients had suffered anoxic injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30-40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with relatively higher metabolic rates, that ranged up to 50-80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained <50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the cortical level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioural patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioural fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical- pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients do not appear to represent random survivals of a few neuronal islands; rather they reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awf131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

32859166,Artery of Percheron infarction presenting as nuclear third nerve palsy and transient loss of consciousness: a case report.,"Ranasinghe, K M I U; Herath, H M M T B; Dissanayake, D; Seneviratne, M",Ranasinghe,"Thalamic blood supply consists of four major vascular territories. Out of them paramedian arteries supply ipsilateral paramedian thalami and occasionally rostral mid brain. Rarely both paramedian arteries arise from a common trunk that arise from P1 segment of one sided posterior cerebral artery (PCA). This is usually due to hypoplastic or absent other P1 and this common trunk is termed Artery of Percheron (AOP). Its prevalence is in the range of 7-11% among the general population and AOP infarcts account in an average of 0.4-0.5% of ischemic strokes. Clinical presentation of AOP infarction is characterized by impaired arousal and memory, language impairment and vertical gaze palsy. It also can present with cerebellar signs, hemi paresis and hemi sensory loss. We herein present a case of AOP infarction presenting as transient loss of consciousness and nuclear third nerve palsy. A 51 year old previously healthy male, was brought to us, with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 7/15. GCS improved to 11/15 by the next day, however he had a persisting expressive aphasia. Right sided nuclear third nerve palsy was apparent with the improvement of GCS. He did not have pyramidal or cerebellar signs. Thrombolysis was not offered as the therapeutic window was exceeded by the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis was made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was done after the initial normal non-contrast computer tomography (NCCT) brain. He was enrolled in stroke rehabilitation. Aspirin and atorvastatin was started for the secondary prevention of stroke. He achieved independency of advanced daily living by 1 month, however could not achieve full recovery to be employed as a taxi driver. Because of the rarity and varied clinical presentation with altered levels of consciousness, AOP infarcts are easily overlooked as a stroke leading to delayed diagnosis. Timely diagnosis can prevent unnecessary investigations and the patient will be benefitted by early revascularization. As it is seldom reported, case reports remain a valuable source of improving awareness among physicians about this clinical entity.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01889-9,PMC7453528,Artery of Percheron (AOP); Case report; Mid brain infarction; Nuclear third nerve palsy; Paramedian thalamic infarction; Thalamic infarction,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Consciousness is a product of brainstem arousal (wakefulness, the level of consciousness) and cortical information integration (awareness, the contents of consciousness). The thalamus serves as a critical hub in the arousal pathway. The nuclei within the internal medullary lamina, together with the associated thalamocortical connections, have been implicated as being especially important for human consciousness. A 17-year old male migraineur developed a sudden episode of unconsciousness after receiving a single dose of intranasal sumatriptan for the treatment of prolonged migraine-associated symptoms. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small bilateral thalamic infarction affecting the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei and the associated non-specific thalamocortical connections as the likely reason for the impairment of consciousness. With the exception of occasional fatigue due to a persistent lesion on the left thalamus, the patient experienced full recovery. Corresponding to the injury, diffusion tensor tractography imaging revealed a distinctive defect on the thalamocortical fibres originating from the left centromedian/parafascicular nuclei complex. The presented case offers an outstanding example of the importance of the arousal system and non-specific thalamocortical connectivity for normal waking consciousness.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2016.1199908,,DBS; Intralaminar nuclei; centromedian thalamus; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion-weighted MRI; electroencephalography; neuromodulation; stroke; thalamocortical connectivity; tractography,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The degree of consciousness varies from coma to vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state. Correct diagnosis has important ethical and legal implications, and pain may be cause of misdiagnosis. We describe here a patient with traumatic brain injury, classified as UWS. His clinical picture was dominated by spasticity, and pain. He underwent intrathecal treatment of spasticity with baclofen. Improvement was not that expected. However, there was a dramatic improvement when ziconotide was added to relieve pain; the patient began to eat by mouth, talk, and his tracheal tube could be removed and he is currently classified as having severe disability. The suspension of ziconotide caused a clear re-worsening of clinical condition, reverted by his reintroduction. Pain is an important factor in patients with DOC. Anecdotal reports of improved consciousness with intrathecal baclofen therapy may be due to pain relief. Reduction of pain in DOC is important and drugs should not interfere with cognition, and must be effective and manageable. Ziconotide may be one of the possible candidate due to its synergistic antispastic action in combination with baclofen when an intratecal pump has been implanted.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

We report the unexpected recovery of functional milestones (i.e., consciousness, communication, and community reintegration) in a 19-year-old man who sustained a severe traumatic brain injury. The early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, at the time, suggested a poor prognosis. During the first year of the patient's recovery, MRI with diffusion tensor imaging and T2*-weighted imaging was performed on day 8 (coma), day 44 (minimally conscious state), day 198 (post-traumatic confusional state), and day 366 (community reintegration). Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, cerebral hemispheric white matter, and thalamus were compared with clinical assessments using the Disability Rating Scale (DRS). Extensive diffusion restriction in the corpus callosum and bihemispheric white matter was observed on day 8, with ADC values in a range typically associated with neurotoxic injury (230-400 × 10(-6 )mm(2)/s). T2*-weighted MRI revealed widespread hemorrhagic axonal injury in the cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and brainstem. Despite the presence of severe axonal injury on early MRI, the patient regained the ability to communicate and perform activities of daily living independently at 1 year post-injury (DRS = 8).

Challenging conventional wisdoms.","Marik, Paul E; Varon, Joseph",Marik,"Therapeutic hypothermia has been reported to improve the neurologic outcome of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The use of therapeutic hypothermia in patients who have had an acute ischemic-hypoxic brain injury after a suicidal intoxication has not been previously reported. We present the case of a young woman who presented comatose to our emergency department after attempting suicide by ingesting diazepam and a bottle of antifreeze (ethylene-glycol). Despite aggressive supportive care, the patient progressed to what appeared to be clinical brain death. At this point, the patient was managed with therapeutic hypothermia for 36 hours. The patient awoke within 48 hours of rewarming and made a complete and full neurologic recovery. In conclusion, this case has important implications in the management of patients who have had an acute ischemichypoxic brain injury.

A 45-year-old male patient was diagnosed as subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages in the left fronto-parieto-temporal lobes. At 5 months after onset, the patient exhibited a persistent vegetative state, with a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score of 4. He underwent comprehensive rehabilitative therapy that included drugs for recovery of impaired consciousness and rTMS of the right dorsolateral prefrontal lobe. He recovered to a minimally conscious state (CRS-R: 13) at 7 months after onset and was transferred to a local rehabilitation hospital where he underwent similar rehabilitation but without rTMS. At 9 months after onset, his CRS-R score remained at 13. He was then readmitted to our hospital and underwent rehabilitation with rTMS until 10 months after onset. His CRS-R remained at 13, but his higher cognition had improved. The tract volume (TV) of the neural tract in the right prefrontal lobe in the upper ARAS on the 7-month DTT was higher than that on the 5-month DTT. However, compared to the 7-month DTT, the right prefrontal lobe TV was lower on the 9-month DTT. On the 10-month DTT, the TV of that neural tract had again increased.

A 76-year-old Japanese man with hypertension presented with presyncope following cervical retroflexion. Head magnetic resonance angiography revealed that the vertebrobasilar circulation was exclusively supplied by the right vertebral artery. Cervical spine computed tomography showed compression of the osteophytes on the right superior articular process of C6 into the right transverse foramen of C5. Moreover, computed tomography angiography and carotid duplex ultrasonography showed decreased blood flow in the right vertebral artery on gradual retroflexion of the neck. Based on the above findings, we speculate that the right vertebral artery was compressed by the osteophytes, with the decreased blood flow being the cause of presyncope following cervical retroflexion.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105562,,Beauty parlor stroke syndrome; Carotid echocardiography; Posterior circulatory inadequacy; computed tomography angiography,Case Reports,United States,eng

MRI of the brain revealed a faint T2W, FLAIR, DWI and ADC heterogenous hyperintense and T1W isointense intra-axial lesion with indistinct margins at the level of the pons and medulla oblongata. The lesion did not show any susceptibility artefact on T2* GRE images or contrast enhancement and CSF analysis was normal. Analysis of the spectra from MRS of the thalamus not promptly available at the time of the MRI study revealed a decreased level of NAA, as seen in people with gliomatosis cerebri. The dog represented 3 weeks later and, on this occasion, displayed left-sided head tilt, left-sided postural reaction deficits and near-syncopal episodes associated with state of confusion. Repeated MRI revealed a larger non-enhancing intra-axial lesion with a more hyperintense signal than previously described. CSF was normal and PCR of CSF for infectious diseases was negative. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography did not reveal any primary or metastatic process. Immunosuppressive treatment was attempted and the dog remained stable over 5 days, then developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures which led to status epilepticus and death. Histopathology supported the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri. Gliomatosis cerebri remains difficult to diagnose ante-mortem, due to the broad age of onset and the variable duration and wide range of clinical signs. The mismatch between MRI findings and clinical presentation, the fluctuating clinical signs with near-syncopal episodes associated with a state of confusion, the presence of an infiltrative brain disease as depicted on MR imaging and a normal CSF analysis, should prompt the clinician to consider possible diagnosis of a widespread infiltrative neoplasm. Although, MRS may help narrow the differential diagnosis in favor of a neoplastic lesion, the overall prognosis remains poor.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Topics in companion animal medicine,10.1016/j.tcam.2021.100508,,GFAP; Olig2; cancer-related fatigue; generalized tonic-clonic seizures; magnetic resonance imaging; syncopal episodes,Case Reports,United States,eng

Abnormal baroreceptor responses with deranged cerebral autoregulation leading to cerebral vasoconstriction have been proposed as a causative mechanism. The authors report the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses in a patient who recovered from orthostatic intolerance and tachycardia. Changes in the orthostatic responses of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), and transcranial Doppler middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean blood flow velocity (Vmean) were assessed at admission and again 6 months after recovery. Normal cardiovascular responses to forced breathing and to standing indicated intact overall baroreflex integrity with normal baroreflex sensitivity (10.2 msec.mm Hg(-1)). After the patient stood for 8 minutes, presyncopal symptoms developed, with unchanged MAP but increased HR (+41 beats/min) and reduced stroke volume (SV) (-69%), CO (-50%), and MCA Vmean (-46%; 57 to 31 cm. s(-1)). After a reconditioning program and recovery, the patient was reexamined. The supine MCA Vmean was larger (79 cm. s(-1)), as were MAP (76 versus 70 mm Hg) and CO (+15%). The orthostatic HR increase was smaller (+5 beats/min), as was the reduction in SV (-44%) and CO (-30%), with an increase in MAP to 93 mm Hg. The orthostatic reduction in MCA Vmean was smaller (-13 versus -26 cm.s(-1)) and standing cerebrovascular resistance decreased (1.41 versus 2.39 mm Hg.cm. s(-1)). In this patient who had intact baroreflex control and no postural decrease in blood pressure, the reduction in MCA Vmean, concomitant with a large decrease in CO, seemed reversible. The result suggests that a symptomatic reduction in cerebrovascular conductance during standing is to be interpreted as being an adaptive response to a critically limited systemic blood flow, rather than to derangement of cerebral autoregulation.",{},,Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society,10.1007/BF02317800,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

However, the diagnoses of vegetative and minimally conscious states can only be made by means of repeated specific neurological examinations. In this respect, this study describes the case of a patient with mismatch of neurophysiological findings despite partial recovery to a minimally conscious state. A 52-year-old man was admitted to the Post-Coma Intensive and Rehabilitation Care Unit with a diagnosis of anoxic encephalopathy. EEG, according to Hockaday, was severely abnormal (Grade IVa). SEP showed bilateral loss of all cortical components. Four weeks after admission the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) score moved from 7/23 to 13/23. This patient persistently showed a mismatch of neurophysiological findings which did not anticipate the slight but discriminating improvement ascertained through the neurological examination. This observation confirms that electrophysiological evaluations can only be regarded as ancillary tools since level of consciousness may be reliably evaluated only by means of repeated specific neurological assessments. As this case-report suggests, neurophysiological findings may turn out to be inconclusive and misleading in relation to the assessment of consciousness and may lead to an underestimate of minimal signs of recovery across the grey-zone from the vegetative to the minimally conscious state.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050802189693,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Ischemic heart disease was suspected based on the myocardial scintigraphy findings, but coronary angiography revealed no unusual findings. Holter electrocardiography did not reveal the reason for his symptoms. Because he had experienced 2-second sinus arrest rather than faintness or pre-syncope during the Holter monitoring (not an indication for the implantation of a pacemaker), we implanted a loop recorder to detect the cause of pre-syncope.The loop recorder required that he or his family to manually send the telemetry monitoring data, but he and his wife did not understand how to do it. After the loop recorder failed to reveal the cause of his symptoms, he was hospitalized for its extraction. When we manually checked the loop recorder data on the day of hospitalization, sinus arrest of >3 seconds was detected 271 times; the maximum sinus arrest was 4 seconds. Sinus arrest was confirmed to be cause of his symptoms. His symptoms completely disappeared after the implantation of a permanent pacemaker.Although faintness is not rare in elderly people, it can be difficult to diagnose.

17577710,Music as a diagnostic tool in low awareness states: considering limbic responses.,"Magee, Wendy L",Magee,"Examining the evidence from contrasting epistemological sources a case is made for the use of music as an assessment medium with patients in low awareness states. Profound brain damage can result in long-term states of altered consciousness such as vegetative and minimally conscious states. Differential diagnosis with this population is immensely complex requiring diverse approaches. Neuroimaging alone is not, as yet, sufficient to establish diagnosis in this population and must be supplemented by repeated behavioural observation methods from a skilled and diverse treatment team, as there are enormous medico-legal and ethical implications. Evidence from research in neuroimaging and the behavioural health sciences indicates that auditory stimulation can reveal residual functioning and elicit optimal behaviours in such patients, particularly when the stimulation has emotional significance. Behavioural assessment is complicated by limbic behaviours which can be misinterpreted as purposeful emotional responses. A case vignette using music therapy in a complex case illustrates such complications. Given the evidence for residual auditory functioning in patients in low awareness states, music is recommended as a medium for assessment. However, professionals involved in diagnosis must take caution against misinterpreting limbic responses and attributing greater meaning to such behaviours.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050701426907,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

We recorded video EEG in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for strictly clinical purposes. Back averaging was performed off-line using Neuroscan 4.3. We recorded spontaneous and stimulus-induced bilateral central PEDs (bi-central PEDs) that were followed by phasic vertex potentials, customarily considered as EEG arousal responses. Bi-central PEDs were associated with myoclonus when provoked by strong and protracted stimuli, but remained subclinical when elicited by auditory or mild tactile stimuli. Spontaneous and stimulus-induced bi-central PEDs disappeared after full neurological recovery. These findings link stimulus-induced PEDs to epileptic cortical myoclonus, and further suggest that in certain comatose patients they may represent reflex epileptic activity, even when clinically silent. The term ""reflex seizures of the critically ill"" may be appropriate in such patients. Our findings may also provide a model of the reciprocal relationship between arousals and epileptiform activity.

The study aimed to evaluate the application of ERPs neuromarkers for the assessment and treatment of a patient with chronic crossed aphasia after severe TBI and a long-term coma. An ambidextrous female patient, aged 29, suffered from posttraumatic chronic crossed aphasia, severe TBI and a prolonged coma after a car accident. The patient took part in two differentiated rehabilitation programmes of neurotherapy included 20 sessions of relative beta training and 20 sessions of rTMS; both programmes were combined with behavioural training. The patient was tested 3 times: before the experiment, after completion of programme A, and after completion of programme B. In the 1st recording, the neuromarker of aphasia was found - an excess of the P2 wave over the left temporal area. There was a cognitive control deficit - an excess of omission errors and an increase of RT variability - all indexes of sporadic ADHD. In the 2nd recording, slight improvements in cognitive control, and language functions were found. In the 3rd recording, after the rTMS sessions most of her cognitive dysfunctions had been resolved, including language functions. It should be stressed that the activation (especially the increase in the ERP potential of the right side over the frontal lobe) was found. The neuromarker of aphasia did not change, only the location had slightly moved frontally.

Accuracy, defined as the number of successes with respect to the total number of trials, was used to evaluate the number of times in which the classification strategy was successful. Analyses of accuracy showed that the patient was able to activate and to relax himself purposefully and that he optimized his performances with the number of sessions, probably as a result of training-related improvements.

The role of the thalamus in the persistent vegetative state.,"Kinney, H C; Korein, J; Panigrahy, A; Dikkes, P; Goode, R",Kinney,"Karen Ann Quinlan had a cardiopulmonary arrest in 1975 and died 10 years later, having never regained consciousness. Her story prompted a national debate about the appropriateness of life-sustaining treatment in patients who are in a persistent vegetative state and led to the development of medicolegal guidelines for the care of such patients. This report describes the neuropathologic features of Quinlan's brain. The entire brain and spinal cord were systematically sampled for histologic examination. The brain stem and central cerebrum were embedded en bloc and serially sectioned. Three-dimensional computer reconstructions helped visualize the topographic features of the lesions. Contrary to expectation, the most severe damage was not in the cerebral cortex but in the thalamus, and the brain stem was relatively intact. The neuropathological findings included extensive bilateral thalamic scarring, bilateral cortical scars primarily in the occipital pole and parasagittal parieto-occipital region, and bilateral damage to cerebellar and focal-basal-ganglia regions. The brain stem and basal forebrain and the hypothalamic components of the ascending arousal systems and brainstem regions critical to cardiac and respiratory control were undamaged. The lesions were consistent with hypoxia-ischemia after the cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the neuropathological findings in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan were complex, the disproportionately severe damage in the thalamus as compared with the cerebral cortex supports the hypothesis that the thalamus is critical for cognition and awareness and may be less essential for arousal.",{},,The New England journal of medicine,10.1056/NEJM199405263302101,,,"Biography; Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

RTA mortality and morbidity are predominantly associated with trauma to the brain tissue resulting in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is commonly employed to predict the prognosis of such cases at the time of hospital admission. A lower GCS score is invariably found to be associated with poor prognosis, often resulting in death or severely com-promised recovery.

Two years later, she was considered to be in a minimally conscious state and became the subject of legal debate in the UK with regard to withdrawal of artificial feeding and hydration. Before injury, she made a verbal advanced directive that she would not wish to continue living if ever becoming severely disabled. Neuropsychological assessment found statistically significant evidence for sentience and expression of a wish to live and the application to Court was withdrawn.

She speaks, initiates conversation and actions, expresses clear and consistent preferences and has a spontaneous sense of humour. She uses an electric wheelchair, eats solid food and drinks through a straw. Her mood is variable and sometimes low. This case demonstrates the need for careful consideration of advanced directives and for specialist neuropsychological assessment in people with severe cognitive and communication difficulties. It supports the view that routine assessment and follow-up of people thought to be in minimally conscious states is important.

9854265,Coordinated expression in chronically unconscious persons.,"Plum, F; Schiff, N; Ribary, U; Llinás, R",Plum,"The clinically described 'persistent vegetative state' (PVS), consists of wakefulness unaccompanied by any evidence of the subject's awareness of self or environment. Past studies from our own and other laboratories have used positron emission tomography (PET) to study brain metabolism in approximately 20 such patients during wakeful periods. All those efforts identified global cerebral glucose metabolism at or below levels encountered during deep barbiturate anaesthesia. Nevertheless, the clinical literature includes rare reports of relatively isolated cognitive functions expressed by PVS patients late in their course. The observation raises the question of whether such activity reflects awareness or unconscious automatic behaviour. We employed magnetometry (MEG), PET scanning, MR imaging and 24-hour EEG recordings to evaluate three patients clinically vegetative between six months and 20 years after onset. Neither meticulous clinical examinations nor 24-hour EEG and video monitoring provided any hint of cognitive interaction in any subject. Nevertheless, patient 1 uttered single words once every 48 hours or more; patient 2 frequently expressed coordinated, non-purposeful, non-dystonic movements in arms and/or legs; and, patient 3 expressed strong emotional negativity without motor responses to noxious stimuli with occasional quieting in response to prosodic stimuli. All patients had whole-brain averaged global metabolism levels below 50% of normal. Patient 1, however, demonstrated preserved islands of increased metabolism in the posterior frontal and posterior temporal lobes, as well as MEG activations of Heschl's gyrus all located in the left hemisphere. In patient 2, selected increased metabolism was confined to the frontal poles and related subcortical structures. MRI in patient 3 demonstrated severe, bilateral post-traumatic cerebral atrophy. PET metabolism was diffusely reduced to 40% of normal but MEG evoked potentials indicated early and late sensory processing with abnormal later evoked components. The correlation of fragmentary behaviour with preserved metabolic and physiologic activity in cortical and subcortical regions known to support specific modular functions is novel. The finding demonstrates the capacity of severely damaged brains to partially express surviving modular functions without evidence of integrative processes that would be necessary to produce consciousness. We conclude that the mere expression of isolated neuropsychologic activity by isolated modules is insufficient to generate consciousness in overwhelmingly damaged brains.",{},,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Recently, task appropriate differential regional activation in VS has been reported using fMRI during mental imagery. Demonstration of conscious awareness in reproducible differential EEG source localization images in a VS patient reflecting requested mental imagery was performed. A VS patient (with re-test) and a normal control were requested to imagine singing and to mentally perform serial subtraction, while EEG was recorded. QEEG source localization was performed to identify regions of brain activation in response to tasks. Replicable distinctive activation of brain areas appropriate for each task was seen in the VS patient and control. Frequency spectra shifted to beta, with significant source activation in regions including the bilateral anterior cingulate, insula, left caudate and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex to singing and the putamen, insula, left pre-frontal cortex and right temporal gyrus to subtraction by 7's. Results from this single case suggests the potential utility of QEEG source localization images to detect awareness in patients clinically diagnosed as being in VS. This indicates the possibility that EEG may serve as an important adjunct to the assessment of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness in the clinical setting.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2011.558045,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

If brain death has not been proven by electrocerebral silence and by absence of spontaneous breathing in an apnoea test in a patient in intensive care, then words like 'brain dead', 'has died' and 'clinical brain death' should be avoided in conversations with the relatives of the patient. This is illustrated by three cases. The first patient was a 46-year-old woman, with thrombosis of the basilar artery; the second was a 26-year-old man who was resuscitated after a bilateral pneumothorax, but developed severe postanoxic encephalopathy; and the third patient was a 64-year-old man with a large intracerebral haemorrhage. The relatives were informed that the patient was 'brain dead' or 'deceased' based on loss of consciousness (Glasgow Coma score of 3) and absence of brain stem reflexes, but prior to the completion of the brain death protocol by electroencephalography and apnoea testing. In the first and third cases, brain death could not be proven, and the pronouncement that the patient was deceased had to be reversed. The emotional relatives refused organ donation. In the second case, death was pronounced upon loss of consciousness and absence of brain stem reflexes. The relatives refused organ donation, after which mechanical ventilation was withdrawn and the patient was declared dead for a second time based on circulatory arrest.

We report here interesting MRI findings in a patient after hanging. A 39-year-old woman was transferred to our department after attempting suicide by hanging. Respiration had probably ceased for about three minutes but heart had not stopped when she was pulled down by her father. After her father performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, she started to breathe immediately. She was treated conservatively in our intensive care unit for 14 days, her condition became stable. Ten days after admission, MRI demonstrated symmetrical hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and relative hyperintensity on T2 weighted images in bilateral lentiform nuclei and medial thalami. There have been several reports about characteristic MRI findings in the case of acute global cerebral ischaemia caused by severe hypoglycaemia or longstanding cardiopulmonary arrest. It was postulated that these specific findings reflected tissue degeneration, deposition of mineral substances, or lipid accumulation. These MRI findings suggest that severe acute global cerebral hypoperfusion also occurs in hanging in the same way as in long-standing cardiopulmonary arrest and that hanging has devastating sequelae.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Resuscitation,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2005.08.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Ireland,eng
