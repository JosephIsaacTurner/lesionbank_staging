33647851,Auditory agnosia with anosognosia.,"Klarendić, Maja; Gorišek, Veronika R; Granda, Gal; Avsenik, Jernej; Zgonc, Vid; Kojović, Maja",Klarendić,"A 66-year-old right-handed female medical doctor suffered two consecutive cardioembolic strokes, initially affecting the right frontal lobe and the right insula, followed by a lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient presented with distinctive phenomenology of general auditory agnosia with anosognosia for the deficit. She did not understand verbal requests and her answers to oral questions were fluent but unrelated to the topic. However, she was able to correctly answer written questions, name objects, and fluently describe their purpose, which is characteristic for verbal auditory agnosia. She was also unable to recognise environmental sounds or to recognise and repeat any melody. These inabilities represent environmental sound agnosia and amusia, respectively. Surprisingly, she was not aware of the problem, not asking any questions regarding her symptoms, and avoiding discussing her inability to understand spoken language, which is indicative of anosognosia. The deficits in our patient followed a distinct pattern of recovery. The verbal auditory agnosia was the first to resolve, followed by environmental sound agnosia. Amusia persisted the longest. The patient was clinically assessed from the first day of symptom onset and the evolution of symptoms was video documented. We give a detailed account of the patient's behaviour and provide results of audiological and neuropsychological evaluations. We discuss the anatomy of auditory agnosia and anosognosia relevant to the case. This case study may serve to better understand auditory agnosia in clinical settings. It is important to distinguish auditory agnosia from Wernicke's aphasia, because use of written language may enable normal communication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.12.025,,Amusia; Anosognosia; Auditory agnosia; Environmental sound agnosia; Verbal auditory agnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

Other causes include surgery such as aortic valve replacement, laryngeal surgery, craniotomy, cerebral angiography, head trauma, and partial seizures. Visual anosognosia is a distinct feature of cortical blindness, wherein patients claim they can see and confabulate visual perceptions, despite loss of sight. We herewith present a rare phenomenon known as Anton Syndrome, an eponym named after the Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist, Gabriel Anton (1858-1933). There are a limited number of cases of Anton's Syndrome in the literature, with only 28 case reports published from 1965-2016. Although he was bestowed a neurologic eponym, Anton was an advocate of eugenics and racial hygiene. He publicly advocated for 'superior breeding' and 'selection' in order to 'build a brave and noble race.' We therefore propose replacing the eponym with Bilateral Occipital Lobe Infarct Neglect Deficit (BLIND) Syndrome, with intention of raising awareness of this unique presentation as well as of the widespread interest in eugenics in the early 1900s amongst physicians, notably Gabriel Anton.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,10.1080/20009666.2021.1974730,PMC8462920,Anton syndrome; atrial tachyarrhythmia; blind syndrome; cortical blindness; visual anosognosia,Case Reports,United States,eng

37860783,Anton syndrome with bilateral occipital infarct: A case report.,"Mankoo, Dylan",Mankoo,"Anton syndrome results from damage to the visual cortex of the occipital lobes, where the anterior visual pathways remain intact. This damage results in the characteristic triad of cortical blindness, visual anosognosia, and visual confabulation. This case describes an 80-year-old male with a background of renal transplant 7 years prior, admitted to hospital with worsening transplant function, and soon after developed sudden onset cortical blindness. On examination, the patient was found to be in denial of his blindness and showed signs of visual confabulation, both of which pointed toward a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. Radiological investigation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral ischemic stroke of the occipital lobes, which was later theorized to have occurred due to sirolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of sirolimus-induced TMA, bilateral ischemic occipital lobe stroke, and Anton's syndrome, within the same diagnosis. This case highlights that a diagnosis of bilateral occipital stroke with denial of blindness should suggest a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. This report also discusses the importance of differentiating bilateral occipital infarction on CT imaging, from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), using MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.09.036,PMC10582287,Anton syndrome; Neuroradiology; Stroke,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

On day 57, he noticed a supernumerary motor phantom limb (SPL) involving his right arm, originating at the level of the elbow. The most notable finding of his SPL was the motor characteristic. When the subject had the intention to move the upper paralyzed limb simultaneously with the trainer's facilitating action, he said ""there is another arm."" The intention to move the paralyzed arm alone or passive movement of the paralyzed arm did not induce the SPL. He showed a severe left sensorimotor impairment and mild hemineglect, but no neglect syndromes of the body (e.g., asomatognosia, somatoparaphrenia, personification and misoplegia, or anosognosia) were observed. Brain MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the right temporal lobe subcortex, subfrontal cortex, putamen, internal capsule, and thalamus. Single-photon emission computed tomography images showed more widespread hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere in comparison to the lesions on MRI. However, the premotor cortex was preserved. Our case is different from Staub's case in that SPL was not induced by the intention to move the paralyzed limb alone; rather, it was induced when the patient intended to move the paralyzed limb with a trainer's simultaneous facilitating action. The SPL may reflect that an abnormal closed-loop function of the thalamocortical system underlies the phantom phenomenon. However, despite the severe motor and sensory impairment, the afferent pathway from the periphery to the premotor cortex may have been partially preserved, and this may have been related to the induction of SPL.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513302,PMC8138257,Intentional motor phantom limb; Premotor cortex; Stroke; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
8441373,Elements of cognitive rehabilitation after right hemisphere stroke.,"Calvanio, R; Levine, D; Petrone, P",Calvanio,"There are two basic approaches to cognitive training: (1) impairment training and (2) task specific training. Impairment training addresses impairments common to a number of tasks and attempts to offer a general benefit to all of the tasks at once. Task specific training focuses on the impairments that arise in a single task and attempts to improve performance on that task. Impairment training of spatial disorders following right hemisphere stroke has shown some success when curricula are properly designed. The success, however, is quite limited because of normal cognitive constraints and those occurring after brain damage. Task specific training in conjunction with the combined application of various cognitive principles appears more promising, but as yet, only a few studies exist. The neurologic factors are likely to be the same factors that influence recovery. The factors that influence trainability are lesion topography (size and location of the focus plus premorbid atrophy), lesion chronicity, and the presence of additional cognitive impairments (anosognosia, confusion, and abulia). Other interventions that may be beneficial, even for training resistant patients, include behavior modification, cognitive prostheses, and drugs.",{},,Neurologic clinics,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

This article provides a brief discussion of the evolution of this concept and reviews some qualitative differences in the manner in which the disavowal of neurogenic impairment is expressed. Theoretical explanations for the unawareness of deficit after neurologic illness include motivational-symbolic, cognitive subsystem, and supraordinate system theories. Observations from a clinically derived, structured awareness interview are presented, suggesting three factors that may underlie patients' apparent lack of awareness of deficits after traumatic brain injury. These include diminished awareness of deficits secondary to impaired cognition, especially memory and reasoning deficits; psychological reactance and denial of deficits; and a relatively ""pure"" inability to recognize areas of impaired functioning as a direct consequence of brain injury. The causes of unawareness are likely to be complex and multiply determined in any given patient, although it may be possible to identify primary, secondary, and even tertiary contributions according to specific behavioral and phenomenological characteristics.

During two months, the evolution of his colour vision deficit was followed with repeated standardized colour vision tests and eye movement recordings. While his performance continuously improved, he became more and more aware of the deficit. Only after colour vision had almost normalized, his subjective colour sensation was inconspicuous again.

7497101,Anosognosia in parietal lobe syndrome.,"Ramachandran, V S",Ramachandran,"Patients with right parietal lesions often deny their paralysis (anosognosia), but do they have ""tacit"" knowledge of their paralysis? I devised three novel tests to explore this. First, the patients were given a choice between a bimanual task (e.g., tying shoe laces) vs a unimanual one (e.g., threading a bolt). They chose the former on 17 of 18 trials and, surprisingly, showed no frustration or learning despite repeated failed attempts. I conclude that they have no tacit knowledge of paralysis (or, if such knowledge exists, it is not available for this particular task). Second, I used a ""virtual reality box"" to convey the optical illusion to the patient that she was moving her paralyzed left hand up and down to the rhythm of a metronome, and yet she showed no sign of surprise. Third, I irrigated patient BM's left ear canal with cold water, a procedure that is known to shift that patient's spatial frame of reference by stimulating the vestibular system. Surprisingly, this allowed her ""repressed"" memory of the paralysis to come to the surface; she said she had been paralyzed continuously for several days. I suggest that the vestibular stimulation produces these remarkable effects by mimicking REM sleep. These patients also employ a whole arsenal of grossly exaggerated Freudian ""defense mechanisms"" to account for their paralysis. To explain this, I propose that in normal individuals the left hemisphere ordinarily deals with small, local anomalies by trying to impose consistency but, when the anomaly exceeds threshold, an interaction with the right hemisphere forces a ""paradigm shift."" A failure of this process, in patients with right hemisphere damage, might partially account for anosognosia. Finally, I present a new conceptual framework that may help link several psychological and neurological phenomena such as Freudian defense mechanisms, vestibular stimulation, anosognosia, memory repression, visual illusions, anterograde amnesia, REM sleep, dreaming, and humor.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1006/ccog.1995.1002,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

In the case discussed herein, a 90-year-old man presented with bilateral blindness, obvious anosognosia, and vivid visual confabulation, which he had had for 3 days. Brain computed tomography demonstrated recent hypodense infarctions at the bilateral occipital lobes. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. Because of his age and the thrombolytic therapy during the golden 3 hours after ischemic stroke, the patient received aspirin therapy rather than tissue plasminogen activator or warfarin. He gradually realized he was blind during the following week, but died of pneumonia 1 month later. In the literature, it is difficult to establish awareness of blindness in patients with Anton-Babinski syndrome, but optimistically, in one report, a patient was aware of blindness within 2 weeks, without vision improvement.

Severe COVID-19 and uremia are risk factors for neurological complications. However, the lack of insight into their pathogenesis, particularly with respect to the role of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is currently hampering effective therapeutic interventions. The aims of this study were to describe the neurological manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and to gain pathophysiological insights with respect to CRS. In this longitudinal study, we performed extensive clinical, laboratory and imaging phenotyping in five patients admitted to our renal unit. Neurological presentation included confusion, tremor, cerebellar ataxia, behavioral alterations, aphasia, pyramidal syndrome, coma, cranial nerve palsy, dysautonomia, and central hypothyroidism. Notably, neurological disturbances were accompanied by laboratory evidence of CRS. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Hyperalbuminorrachia and increased levels of the astroglial protein S100B were suggestive of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings comprised evidence of acute leukoencephalitis (n = 3, one of whom had a hemorrhagic form), cytotoxic edema mimicking ischaemic stroke (n = 1), or normal results (n = 2). Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins was attempted, resulting in rapid recovery from neurological disturbances in two cases. SARS-CoV2 was undetectable in 88 of the 90 patients with COVID-19 who underwent Reverse Transcription-PCR testing of CSF. Patients with COVID-19 can develop neurological manifestations that share clinical, laboratory and imaging similarities with those of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell-related encephalopathy.

However, only few studies have successfully recorded on-line the activation of the autonomous or the motoric nervous systems.

This would argue for parallel processes of stimuli identification routines and response selection mechanisms on the basis of only provisionally worked out stimulus features. Investigating an anosognostic patient we found electrodermal activity (EDA) and electromyographic responses (EMG) to bimanual tasks, mental imagery, and to the request to execute specific actions. But overt behavior remained hemiplegic and the patient was unable to feel any kind of control of her paralyzed left arm and hand.

SPECT scan showed marked hypoperfusion in the right parietotemporal cortex and this extended to the associative cortex in the right frontal regions. The persistence of anosognosia in this patient cannot be explained by memory impairments or global cognitive decline.

This condition is known as anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP). Recent behavioural experiments suggest that some residual intentionality might be preserved in patients with anosognosia and that the false belief of having moved originates from a failure to notice discrepancies between movement expectancies and the actual state of the motor system. This failure may be caused by a lack of afferent sensory information concerning the movement or alternatively by a direct dysfunction of the brain regions involved in actions' motor monitoring (i.e., the comparator system). Here we examined the effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the right premotor cortex in a patient with a bilateral lesion, involving predominantly the right hemisphere, and a dense unawareness for his left hemiplegia. During sham or anodal tDCS the patient was requested to judge his ability to perform simple motor actions (i) without actually executing the movement itself (""offline"" condition) and after having performed a series of verbally cued finger opposition movements (""online"" condition) with (i) eyes-closed or (ii) eyes-open. We found that anodal tDCS induces a significant remission of the false experience of movement only when the patient is requested to actually perform the movement with eyes open. Conversely, the patient's awareness does not improve in both the ""offline"" condition (in which the patient does not attempt to perform the movement) and in the ""online"" condition, when vision is precluded (""online"" condition, eyes-closed). We conclude that the stimulation of the premotor cortex by tDCS activates brain regions involved in motor monitoring, temporary restoring the ability of the motor comparator system to correctly appreciate afferent information and build up a veridical motor awareness.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.007,,Anosognosia for hemiplegia; Intention to move; Motor awareness; Neglect; Transcranial direct current stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

8708688,Memory without context: amnesia with confabulations after infarction of the right capsular genu.,"Schnider, A; Gutbrod, K; Hess, C W; Schroth, G",Schnider,"To explore the mechanism of an amnesia marked by confabulations and lack of insight in a patient with an infarct of the right inferior capsular genu. The confabulations could mostly be traced back to earlier events, indicating that the memory disorder ensued from an inability to store the temporal and spatial context of information acquisition rather than a failure to store new information. To test the patient's ability to store the context of information acquisition, two experiments were composed in which she was asked to decide when or where she had learned the words from two word lists presented at different points in time or in different rooms. To test her ability to store new information, two continuous recognition tests with novel non-words and nonsense designs were used. Recognition of these stimuli was assumed to be independent of the context of acquisition because the patient could not have an a priori sense of familiarity with them. The patient performed at chance in the experiments probing knowledge of the context of information acquisition, although she recognised the presented words almost as well as the controls. By contrast, her performance was normal in the recognition tests with non-words and nonsense designs. These findings indicate that the patient's amnesia was based on an inability to store the context of information acquisition rather than the information itself. Based on an analysis of her lesion, which disconnected the thalamus from the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, and considering the similarities between her disorder, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and the amnesia after orbitofrontal lesions, it is proposed that contextual amnesia results from interruption of the loop connecting the amygdala, the dorsomedial nucleus, and the orbitofrontal cortex.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.61.2.186,PMC1073994,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Given the recent suggestion that right (frontal) systems are selectively involved in negative emotions, it might be claimed that anosognosia results from a disruption in negative emotions. This is not consistent with the finding that some anosognosic patients exhibit substantial fluctuations in emotion, including the experience of negative emotions such as sadness. The present study investigates a patient (IW) with a right convexity lesion and anosognosia. He reported being frequently overcome by powerful emotions, especially sadness. IW was assessed on a self-report emotion questionnaire, where his reports were typically of higher levels of emotion than the control group. He was also assessed on the more indirect measure of Affective Story Recall. Here his pattern of emotional experience was similar to that of two control groups, one of which consisted of non-anosognosic patients with hemiparesis. His performance on Story Recall was notable in that he directed his emotions to a different 'object' to that of controls (other vs. self, respectively).

This study monitored the course of acute occupational therapy using perceptive exploration activities in a patient with USN who had difficulty in manipulating tools for daily living after a stroke. A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for conservative treatment of hemiparesis and USN caused by stroke. He was previously diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to middle cerebral artery occlusion. His main symptoms were hemiparesis, egocentric spatial neglect in personal space and peripersonal space, and allocentric neglect, which made it difficult to use tools for daily living. Within 24 h of admission, perceptive exploration activities were initiated as the main therapy in addition to preparatory therapies, such as the facilitation of selective movement of limbs affected by paralysis. These therapies were provided over a 30-day period in 40-min sessions, 5 days a week. This treatment resulted in improved test results for the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Bisiach's body neglect and anosognosia scales, and the Behavioral Inattention Test. The Functional Independence Measure scores also improved with the improvement of neglect symptoms.

Denial of eye closure was sought in 43 cases of denial of illness from a series of 400 acute strokes. Subjects underwent a neurological examination, and audiotaped interviews were performed during which they were asked to finger count through their closed eyes and their denial was challenged. Five of 43 patients with denial of hemiplegia after acute stroke were also found to have denial of eye closure (12%). Denial of eye closure was associated with drowsiness and in all but one patient with disorientation. In the three cases with imaging or autopsy data available, lesions were moderate to large, in the right hemisphere, and involved the frontal lobe. Three subjects confabulated as to what they saw through their closed eyes. One subject mislocalized the hospital closer to her home. Denial of eye closure occurs in a minority of patients with denial of illness after acute stroke. This phenomenon sheds light on denial as a whole and cannot easily be accounted for by unilateral explanations, such as inattention to one half of the body or loss of sensory input.

This procedure has been adjusted and applied here, as the basis of two intervention protocols administered independently to two patients with severe AHP. The first study used multiple, successive sessions of video-based self-observation in an acute patient, targeting first the awareness of upper limb and subsequently lower limb paralysis. The second study used a single session of video-based, self- and other-observation in a patient at the chronic stage following onset. Both protocols also involved elements of rapport building and emotional support. The results revealed that video-based self-observation had dramatic, immediate effects on awareness in both acute and chronic stages and it seemed to act as an initial trigger for eventual symptom remission. Nevertheless, these effects did not automatically generalise to all functional domains. This study provides provisional support that video-based self-observation may be included in wider rehabilitation programmes for the management and restoration of anosognosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2014.923319,,Anosognosia; Motor awareness; Neurorehabilitation; Perspective; Video replay,"Case Reports; Clinical Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

By means of a series of tests and experiments, we evaluated the main theoretical approaches.

Each one believed to be living in a nightmare and thought about committing suicide in order to wake up. One patient developed symptoms as described in Cotard delusion. Aspects of neuroanatomy, psychodynamics, and anthropology are discussed with reference to the literature. Frontal and temporal lesions seem only to play a facilitating role but not to be a necessary condition. There is evidence for additional influence of psychological and premorbid personality factors. Summarizing the current state of information we consider depersonalization with the experience of being in a dream or being dead as a heuristic reaction to brain damage. Similar models have already been discussed in neuropsychological disorders as for instance reduplicative paramnesias, neglect, and anosognosia.",{},,Der Nervenarzt,10.1007/s001150050388,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Germany,ger

We hypothesized that there would be a small response to relative beta training, and a good response to rTMS, applied to regulate the dynamics of brain function. M. L-S, age 26, suffered from anosognosia, executive dysfunction, and behavioral changes, after a skiing accident and prolonged coma, rendering him unable to function independently in many situations of everyday life. Only slight progress was made after traditional rehabilitation. The patient took part in 20 sessions of relative beta training (program A) and later in 20 sessions of rTMS (program B); both programs were combined with behavioral training. We used standardized neuropsychological testing, as well as ERPs before the experiment, after the completion of program A, and again after the completion of program B. As hypothesized, patient M.L-S showed small improvements in executive dysfunction and behavioral disorders after the conclusion of program A, and major improvement after program B. Similarly, in physiological changes the patient showed small improvement after relative beta training and a significant improvement of the P300 NOGO component after the rTMS program. The rTMS program produced larger physiological and behavioral changes than did relative beta training. A combination of different neurotherapeutical approaches (such as neurofeedback, rTMS, tDCS) can be suggested for similar severe cases of TBI. ERPs can be used to assess functional brain changes induced by neurotherapeutical programs.",{},,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,10.12659/msm.881970,PMC3539468,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

21830864,Mirror writing resulting from an egocentric representation disorder: a case report.,"Canzano, L; Piccardi, L; Bureca, I; Guariglia, C",Canzano,"Buchwald (1878 ) used the term 'mirror writing' to indicate writing in the reverse direction to what is normal in a particular language and in which the individual letters are also reversed. Cases of healthy individuals (i.e., Leonardo da Vinci and Lewis Carroll) as well as brain-damaged patients have been described in the literature. Here, we report the case of PM, a 70-year-old right-handed woman who showed right hemiplegia and mirror writing following a stroke in the left lenticular nucleus and internal capsulae. PM underwent a complete neuropsychological evaluation, which included copying, dictation and spontaneous writing in both hemispaces with both hands. She was also tested for topographical disorientation, visuo-spatial disorders and body schema deficits. We observed isolated mirror writing only when PM wrote with the left hand, without differences between hemispaces. She also showed a left-right disorientation, a body topological map disorder and an egocentric misrepresentation. The presence of mirror writing not confined to one hemispace and the co-presence of executive function disorders, as well as anosognosia, suggests damage to our patient's sub-cortical frontal network. As no previous interpretation fits with PM's symptoms, we hypothesize that mirror writing resulted from damage to her egocentric frame of reference. This hypothesis allows us to interpret the patient's array of disorders, including mirror writing, body topological map disorder, left-right confusion and egocentric representation.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2010.532143,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 78-year-old left-handed woman with atrial fibrillation had an acute onset of right hemiparesis and difficulty in eye opening. On admission, mild disorientation, vertical gaze palsy, right homonymous hemianopia, anosognosia of right hemiparesis, agnosia of right side of the body and forced grasping reflex of the left hand were seen. She was aware of her difficulty in opening her eyelids. Vertical saccadic eye movements were absent to command but when her head was free to move, the vertical saccadic eye movements improved that may suggest oculomotor apraxia. Bell's phenomenon was absent, and optokinetic responses were normal. Aphasia and facial apraxia were not seen. Brain CT and MRI demonstrated infarction in the territory of the anterior divisions of the left middle cerebral artery which includes the inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, fronto-parietal operculum and temporal operculum. SPECT disclosed hypoperfusion area in the left frontal lobe. No lesion was seen in the midbrain and pons. On the basis of these findings, cerebral emboli of the divisions of the left middle cerebral artery were diagnosed. Until about 11th days from onset, she could not open her eyelids by our verbal commands or even voluntarily, and showed paradoxical contraction of the bilateral orbicularis oculi muscles by verbal commands to open her eyes or when her eyes were forcedly opened by hands. After the 12th days from the onset, she became to be able to open her eyes voluntarily when she was asked to count the number of fingers presented in front of her face and when her families called her, but she could not open her eyes by verbal commands, which may be characteristic of apraxia of eyelid opening. She also had bilateral blephaloptosis when she opened her eyes. Considering this case together with previous reports, embolic lesion of the left cerebral hemisphere including the frontal eye field area and its adjacent areas which may be involved in higher control of eye lid movements and supranuclear vertical gaze movements was thought to cause difficulties in eye opening and vertical gaze palsy.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

We believe the observed dramatic reinstatement of the patient's awareness related to her self-observation 'from the outside' (3rd person perspective) and 'off-line' (at a time later than the actual attempt to execute a movement); her anosognosia had been unaltered when she observed her plegic arm in her ipsilateral visual field (self-observation from a 1st-person perspective and 'on-line'). To our knowledge, the role of self-observation in videos or mirrors has not being assessed in AHP to date. Our study provides preliminary evidence that, when right hemisphere damage impairs the ability to update one's body representation, judgements relying on 3rd-person and off-line self-observation may be spared in some patients and may facilitate 1st person awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.01.018,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The infrequency with which it is encountered makes it a diagnostic challenge. We present the case of a 51-year-old male who, 30 min after successful angiography for treatment of a right carotid-ophthalmic fusiform aneurysm with a stent, developed psychomotor agitation, disorientation, and progressive left faciobrachial hemiparesis (4/5). An emergency nonenhanced CT showed marked cortical enhancement and edema in the right cerebral hemisphere. Cortical enhancement is thought to be secondary to contrast extravasation due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Angiography was performed immediately, without any pathologic findings. After this procedure there was an increase in the left faciobrachial hemiparesis (3/5), right gaze deviation, Gerstmann syndrome, and left anosognosia and left homonymous hemianopsia. Endovenous dexamethasone and mannitol were initiated. Twenty-four hours later an MRI showed no signs of acute infarct, just gyriform signal increase in the right cerebral hemisphere on FLAIR and a decrease in the edema observed before. The patient had progressive improvement of his neurological deficit. A control MRI done 5 days later was normal. The patient recovered completely and was discharged. This rare entity should be kept in mind but diagnosed only when all other causes have been ruled out, because more important and frequent causes, such as acute infarct, must be excluded promptly.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,10.1007/s00270-009-9609-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Both had suddenly developed central facial weakness, hemiplegia and hemisensory deficit in the left side. Anosognosia for the left hemiplegia, motor impersistence and left unilateral spatial neglect were also present. Initially they showed difficulty in keeping their eyes closed to the same degree on both eyes. However, this symmetrical motor impersistence of eye closing developed into a differential pattern over the days. Thus, on verbal command to close the eyes, the right eye in the non-paretic side would be closed continuously and excessively and in the left eye in the paretic side would be closed slightly and impresistently. This dissociation of eye closure was not observed in spontaneous eye closure. This symptom is close to the contralateral motor impersistence of eye closure which has been attributed to the right hemispheric lesion. But the concurrence of the ipsilateral overcontraction of the orbicularis oculi has not been described to the authors' knowledge.

These analysis seemed to reveal three main characteristics of unilateral left agraphia of this patient. These were as follows; 1) productive, 2) neographic and 3) iterative. Another important feature of this patient was the mute state during her left-hand writing. Her left agraphia could not explained by apraxic factor, because her copying capacity was remarkably preserved in comparison with her dictation or written naming ability. Furthermore, this agraphia was not aphasic because her right-hand writing was almost intact. We agreed with Yamadori who insisted that this type of agraphia was neither apraxic nor aphasic, but the particular third agraphia which was named as ""disconnection agraphia"". We considered that the mute state during her left-hand writing might some kind of transient aphasia, which may reflect the functional disturbance of left hemisphere, and the reduced energy in the left hemisphere could increase the activity of right hemisphere. Partial interhemispheric disconnection might induce transient ""linguistic anosognosia"" in this patient.

Its characteristics are slow downward eye movement with rapid upward return, a nadir at the extreme of downgaze position and horizontal roving eye movement. We present a case of IOB associated with cerebral embolism and diabetes insipidus. A 69 year-old right-handed woman was admitted because of a consciousness disturbance. She had been well until November 10, 1983, when she was found dysarthric and left hemiplegic. On admission, she was stuporous. There were conjugate deviation to the right, central left facial and hypoglossal palsy, left hemiplegia with spasticity, left hyperreflexia with positive pathologic reflex and anosognosia. A CT scan performed on November 11 showed extensive hypodense area in the region supplied by the right middle cerebral artery. A right carotid angiography revealed multiple occlusions in the top of the right internal carotid artery with poor collateral circulation. After admission, the level of consciousness gradually deteriorated and became comatose on November 18, when the following abnormal eye movements were observed. Following spontaneous horizontal roving eye movement, both eyes deviated downward slowly from midposition, taking 1 to 2 seconds to reach the nadir. The eyes then remained in the position for 1 to 15 seconds, followed by a rapid return to the midposition. These abnormal eye movements are compatible with inverse ocular bobbing (IOB) described by Knobler. Electronystagmography detected typical IOB and spontaneous upward nystagmus. There was no evidence of hypoxia when these abnormal eye movements were present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Brain CT and MRI demonstrated infarctions in the left lateral thalamus, internal capsule, lateral geniculate body, hippocampus, caudate nucleus and medial occipitotemporal gyrus. IMP-SPECT showed extensive hypoperfusion areas in the left cerebral hemisphere. These lesions were thought to have resulted from occlusion of the left anterior choroidal artery and partial occlusion of the left middle and posterior cerebral arteries caused by cardiogenic embolism. AG persisted and SP disappeared 80 days after the onset.

Delusion had the remarkable intrinsic coherence of a paranoid delirium but was limited to the localization in space. In contrast these patients had no mental clouding or hallucinations and were well orientated for time and persons. Associated findings were a misrepresentation of space in drawing in the first case, and a left hemiparesis, a left sensory extinction, a left hemianopsia, a left visual neglect, a constructional apraxia and a misrepresentation of space in the second case. Such a spatial delirium has been described after severe head injury but rarely after unilateral cerebral lesions. The latter involve constantly the right hemisphere, either in the frontal, temporo-parietal or thalamic region.

In our previous study (Kawamura, Hirayama et al., 1987), we suggested that it may be useful for localization because this phenomenon was observed most frequently in patients with a right putaminal hemorrhage of medium or large size, an average of 42 ml on CT scans, presenting a slight disturbance of consciousness and, in about half of the patients, anosognosia. We also suggested that since alloesthesia is produced not only in cerebral but also in spinal cord lesions, it seems to represent an elementary sensory disturbance of sensory pathways, not a higher cortical dysfunction. We recently observed alloesthesia in two other patients with smaller right putaminal hemorrhages, 7 ml and 6 ml, respectively, who exhibited no disturbance of consciousness, but had impairment not only of superficial but also of proprioceptive sensations. In Patient 1, superficial sensations were intact on admission, except those on the left side of the face. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) after stimulating the median nerve were measured on Patient 1 on the 11th hospital day when a left hemihypalgesia had developed due to enlargement of the hematoma from 7 to 14 ml. Stimulation of the clinically affected side (left) evoked no N20 from the contralateral scalp. Right-sided stimulation was normal.

She presented the triad of hemiplegia, hemianaesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia, as well as complete non-determinant hemisphere syndrome that combined: disorientation for place and time, anosognosia, hemiasomatognosia, left spatial neglect, constructional apraxia and spatial fabulation concerning both the present time and the weeks that preceded the vascular event. Language and verbal memory were normal. Spatial memory could not be studied because of the severity of the neglect. The clinical course was poor: when tested one and a half year post-onset, the hemiplegia, the hemianaesthesia, and the hemianopsia as well as left spatial neglect remained severe. Vestibular caloric stimulation, carried out with left ear cold water irrigation, resulted in brief but clear-cut alleviation of the spatial neglect. An MRI with both axial and coronal slices showed a right-sided infarct affecting the whole posterior limb of the internal capsule including the genu, the posterior part of the globus pallidus, the anterior third of the cerebral peduncle and the amygdala but sparing the thalamus and the corona radiata. This crescent-shaped lesion transected entirely the thalamo-cortical connection fibers which resulted in a ""thalamic exclusion"". The measurement of brain glucose utilisation with (18F)-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose and positron emission tomography performed in the chronic phase (3 months post-onset) showed an exceptionally severe and widespread hypometabolism of the right hemisphere, relative to the left hemisphere, which correlated with both the unusual, severe and protracted non-dominant hemisphere syndrome. All the brain regions on the right side were hypometabolic relative to the left including the temporal region (mostly medial temporal), the left cerebellar lobe, the frontal lobe (mostly prefrontal region), the occipital region and the thalamus. The hypometabolism of the basal ganglia, the sensorimotor area and the parietal cortex was less severe.

The fulminant terminal course was ascribed to hemorrhage within the tumor and subsequent central type of transtentorial herniation. Opinions were divided regarding the cause of hemorrhage; some participants thought hemorrhage was caused by DIC. Post-mortem examination revealed an adenocarcinoma arising at the S6 segment of the left lung with multiple organ metastases.
