NIHSS was 0/42. Neurological examination revealed chorea-like movements over the left limbs, especially the foot. No other neurological signs were present. CT perfusion showed right cortical hypoperfusion due to right M2 occlusion, basal-ganglia perfusion was normal. Brain MRI revealed a small focus of restricted diffusion in the right insula, sparing basal ganglia. Based on the neuroimaging features and clinical correlation, despite the NIHSS score, we decided to treat the patient with alteplase, after iv-thrombolysis hyperkinetic movements ceased completely. Brain-MRI performed 72 h after symptom onset confirmed a confined insular ischemic lesion without the involvement of deep gray matter structures. Hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as hemichorea hemiballismus, are rare presentations of stroke, basal ganglia are mainly involved even if the insular cortex has been described too. Clinical decision on whether to treat ischemic stroke does not include movement disorders.

35431875,Dysarthria-Facial Paresis and Rostral Pontine Ischemic Stroke.,"Miyawaki, Edison K; Wilcox, Douglas R; Kraft, Andrew W; Guenette, Jeffrey P",Miyawaki,"We describe an acute, postoperative dysarthria-facial paresis. While the rare stroke syndrome has been described previously, we present an under-described clinical nuance to its presentation with a particularly clear imaging correlation. A 78-year-old, right-handed man with a past medical history of aortic stenosis presented after a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Immediately postoperatively, no neurological deficits were noted. That evening, he described his speech as ""drunken."" He was later noted to have a right lower facial droop in addition to the speech change. His speech exhibited labial, lingual, and (to a lesser degree) guttural dysarthria. At the patient's request due to claustrophobia, he received 2 mg of oral lorazepam prior to cranial imaging. Afterwards, he was sleepy but arousable, yet was unable to put pen to paper when asked to write. Right lower facial paresis persisted, but he now demonstrated a right pronator drift, which resolved after 14 h without other evolution to his clinical examination. Brainstem lesions above the level of the pontine facial nucleus may present with central facial paresis contralateral to the lesion. An associated dysarthria may have both labial and lingual features in the absence of tongue or pharyngeal weakness. Our review of reported cases of dysarthria in isolation, dysarthria in combination with facial paresis, and facial paresis finds that all presentations may result from cortical, subcortical, or brainstem involvement. Stroke mechanisms are most commonly thromboembolic or small-vessel-ischemic in either the anterior or posterior circulations.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000522283,PMC8958628,Dysarthria; Facial paresis; Ischemic stroke; Pons,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

However, it is frequently missed in cases involving the cerebellum, resulting in a lack of treatment, which can directly impact stroke rehabilitation. A 63-year-old Caucasian female with no history of mood disorders presented with gait instability, dysarthria, and right sided hemiplegia, secondary to cerebellar and pontine ischemic stroke from a basilar occlusion. She underwent endovascular therapy and her deficits gradually improved. However during recovery she began to develop uncontrollable tearfulness while retaining insight that her emotional expression was contextually inappropriate. She was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with reported improvements in her emotional regulation at one year follow up. This case highlights cerebellar injury as a potential cause of poorly regulated emotions, or an emotional dysmetria. The recognition of this disorder in patients with cerebellar or pontine strokes is critical, as untreated pseudobulbar affect can impact future stroke rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04294-1,PMC10722665,Case report; Cerebellum; Depression; Emotional lability; Ischemic stroke; Pseudobulbar affect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35903929,Capecitabine-related neurotoxicity presenting with agraphia.,"Iscan, Dilek; Tolay, Rumeysa; Bayram, Ertugrul; Demir, Turgay; Bicakci, Sebnem",Iscan,"Capecitabine is a pre-metabolite of 5-fluorouracil and is used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Among the common side effects of capecitabine, there are gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and dermatological side effects including hand-foot syndrome and skin pigmentation change. However, neurological side effects of capecitabine are very rare. We describe herein a patient who developed neurological side effects in the form of agraphia and dysarthria on the 7th day of capecitabine treatment. A 34-year-old male patient, who was being followed up with the diagnosis of colon cancer, presented with speech and writing disorder that developed while under capecitabine treatment. Dysarthria and agraphia were detected in his neurological examination. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute diffusion restriction in the splenium of the corpus callosum and at the level of the bilateral centrum semiovale. Brain MRI revealed symmetrical T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) signal increases at the right temporoparietal medial, corpus callosum level, and bilateral white matter level. The capecitabine treatment was terminated, and methylprednisolone treatment was administered and plasmapheresis procedure was carried out. Subsequently, significant improvement was observed in the clinical findings and neuroimaging. Capecitabine is used as an oral agent; thus, it provides ease of use. Neurological side effects associated with the use of capecitabine reportedly occur very rarely. The findings of this case demonstrated that leukoencephalopathy can be seen during the use of capecitabine, imaging results are very important in the diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy, and improvement can be achieved with the termination of the capecitabine treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,10.1177/10781552221116329,,Agraphia; capecitabine; neurotoxicity,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Subjects with cerebellar tremor and either head trauma or stroke were identified using a computerized database, providing detailed demographic and clinical information of 4002 patients with involuntary movements other than Parkinson's disease seen at our center between 1983 and 1995. Medical records and videotaped neurological examinations were retrospectively reviewed. The Center for Parkinson's Disease and Other Movement Disorders at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY. Five patients with delayed-onset cerebellar syndromes. Five patients with stroke or head trauma developed a cerebellar syndrome 3 weeks to 2 years after the initial insult. The syndrome, characterized by intention tremor, ataxic dysarthria, nystagmus, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, and gait ataxia, was progressive in at least one patient. In four patients, lesions were present on neuroimaging in the thalamus or brain stem (especially in the midbrain). A delayed-onset cerebellar syndrome may follow head trauma or stroke. The syndrome is sometimes progressive and often disabling. The delayed onset implies that the syndrome is not caused by the initial lesion itself but may be caused by development of post-synaptic supersensitivity or secondary reorganization of involved pathways.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1996.00550050080027,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

We investigated N.M., a person with bilateral amygdala damage and a left thalamic lesion, who was impaired at recognizing fear from facial expressions. N.M. showed an equivalent deficit affecting fear recognition from body postures and emotional sounds. His deficit of fear recognition was not linked to evidence of any problem in recognizing anger (a common feature in other reports), but for his everyday experience of emotion N.M. reported reduced anger and fear compared with neurologically normal controls. These findings show a specific deficit compromising the recognition of the emotion of fear from a wide range of social signals, and suggest a possible relationship of this type of impairment with alterations of emotional experience.",{},,Proceedings.

30927916,A case of methylprednisolone treatment for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy.,"Li, Li; Tang, Xiaogang; Li, Wenlei; Liang, Seng; Zhu, Qing; Wu, Minghua",Li,"Metronidazole, a common antimicrobial agent, can induce encephalopathy in rare cases. After discontinuing metronidazole, most patients show clinical improvement. However, in the face of deteriorating conditions, there have done not to have reports of effective drug treatment. A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to dysarthria and ataxic gait after taking metronidazole at the dose of about 32‚Äâg for 20‚Äâdays. Neurological examination showed that his upward and outward movements of bilateral eyeballs were limited, and horizontal and vertical nystagmus were noted. The brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyper-intensities in the bilateral cerebellar dentate nuclei, medulla oblongata, midbrain and red nuclei in T2W and FLAIR images. However, the patient's clinical symptoms worsened after drug cessation. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy was applied, and this led to a drastic improvement of his symptoms and signs. In our case, we suggest that early methylprednisolone intervention can prevent the progression of metronidazole-induced encephalopathy and accelerate neurological recovery. We infer that the progression of encephalopathy is related to the delayed toxicity caused by high dose or concentration of metronidazole.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-019-1278-6,PMC6441175,Cerebellar dentate nuclei; Methylprednisolone; Metronidazole-induced encephalopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

30643669,Post-Stroke Lingual Dystonia: Clinical Description and Neuroimaging Findings.,"Pandey, Sanjay; Tater, Priyanka",Pandey,"Lingual dystonia is extremely rare following stroke. We describe clinical features and neuroimaging findings in a series of 11 patients (seven acute and four chronic) with post-stroke lingual dystonia and review the literature. This was a case series using a preformed structured proforma and review of literature using a PubMed search. In our case series, all patients had dysarthria as a presenting symptom. Seven patients had acute presentation (six had an ischemic infarct and one had thalamic hemorrhage) and four had chronic presentation (all had infarct). All patients except one had small infarcts, with the majority of them in the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter regions. Additional chronic ischemic lesions were seen in all patients with acute presentation. The majority of the patients with acute (five out of seven; 71.42%) presentation had left-sided involvement on imaging. We could identify only one case of acute post-stroke lingual dystonia following the PubMed search. Three other cases of post-stroke lingual dystonia with chronic presentation have been described; however, these were associated with oromandibular or cranial dystonia. Our results, based on brain lesions, suggest that all lingual dystonia patients with acute infarcts had underlying chronic infarcts. Overall, more left-sided than right-sided strokes were observed with post-stroke lingual movement disorders including dystonia; however, the data were not significant (p‚Ää=‚Ää1). All patients had dysarthria, with only one having mild tongue weakness and only four having facial weakness.

A 56-year-old male with a closed head injury was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) with GCS=4 (V1, M2, E1). Computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed a limited subarachnoid haemorrhage in the sylvian region without any brain oedema or ventricular shift. The GCS did not change until day 6. At the same time EEG showed a reactivity to acoustic stimuli consisting in the paradoxical appearance of a posterior rhythm in alpha range (10-12c/s), blocked by passive eye opening. Early cortical components (N20-P25) of somatosensory evoked potentials were normal on both hemispheres; middle components were also clearly evident. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed both diffuse and midbrain axonal injuries, particularly in a strategic lesion involving both cerebral peduncles. Event related potentials showed N2 and P3 components to stimulation by rare tones. A comprehensive multimodal neurophysiological approach, using the more informative tests and the proper time of recording, should be included in protocols for patients with severe head trauma, in order to establish the actual patient's clinical state and to avoid that a locked-in syndrome state be mistaken for prolonged coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state or akinetic mutism.

We describe a unique case of an HOD patient who presented with palatal myoclonus secondary to Wernekinck commissure syndrome caused by a rare bilateral ""heart-shaped"" infarct lesion in the midbrain. A 49-year-old man presented with progressive gait instability in the past 7 months. The patient had a history of posterior circulation ischemic stroke presenting with diplopia, slurred speech, and difficulty in swallowing and walking 3 years prior to admission. The symptoms improved after treatment. The feeling of imbalance appeared and was aggravated gradually in the past 7 months. Neurological examination demonstrated dysarthria, horizontal nystagmus, bilateral cerebellar ataxia, and 2-3¬†Hz rhythmic contractions of the soft palate and upper larynx. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain performed 3 years prior to this admission showed an acute midline lesion in the midbrain exhibiting a remarkable ""heart appearance"" on diffusion weighted imaging. MRI after this admission revealed T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity with hypertrophy of the bilateral inferior olivary nucleus. We considered a diagnosis of HOD resulting from a midbrain heart-shaped infarction, which caused Wernekinck commissure syndrome 3 years prior to admission and later HOD. Adamantanamine and B vitamins were administered for neurotrophic treatment. Rehabilitation training was also performed. One year later, the symptoms of this patient were neither improved nor aggravated. This case report suggests that patients with a history of midbrain injury, especially Wernekinck commissure injury, should be alert to the possibility of delayed bilateral HOD when new symptoms occur or original symptoms are aggravated.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-023-03157-y,PMC10050798,Hypertrophic olivary degeneration; Palatal myoclonus; Wernekinck Commissure Syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35675222,Contralateral Tongue Deviation Due to Paramedian Pontine Infarction: A Brief Review of Cortico-Hypoglossal Projections.,"Zhou, Chenxuan; Cheng, Mengyao",Zhou,"BACKGROUND Motor function of the tongue is controlled by the hypoglossal nucleus (the lower motor neuron) and its supranuclear innervation (the upper motor neuron). Tongue deviation due to muscle weakness on one side is common in brain stem stroke and is usually associated with dysarthria and dysphagia that decrease the patient's quality of life. This case report presents a typical but rarely discussed case of tongue deviation secondary to a brain stem stroke. In addition, it also offers a concise review of both the ipsilateral and the contralateral cortico-hypoglossal fibers that innervate the hypoglossal nucleus. Even though the direction of the tongue deviation offers essential clues to localizing the brain lesion, many providers lack experience and knowledge in this area. CASE REPORT We report the case of an 81-year-old right-handed male patient with right-sided hemiparesis, right lower facial droop, dysarthria, and tongue deviated to the right side without fasciculation or atrophy. The Babinski sign was positive on the right. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infarct in the left paramedian pontine. Since both the tongue deviation and the hemiparesis were right-sided, contralateral to the side of the lesion, we concluded that the lesion affected the cortico-hypoglossal fibers and the corticospinal fibers prior to their decussations. CONCLUSIONS The case report reviews the projections of the corticospinal fibers. Each hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both hemispheres, with the contralateral descending fibers passing through the medial part of the ventral pons and the ipsilateral descending fibers passing through the more lateral aspect of the pons. The decussation is generally located at the pontomedullary junction, with exceptions due to individual variance.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936511,PMC9190772,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
36701735,Monochorea after acute contralateral pontine infarction: A case report.,"Hwang, Yun Su; Shin, Byoung-Soo; Ryu, Han Uk; Kang, Hyun Goo",Hwang,"Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement characterized by random, brief, and involuntary muscle contractions. In stroke, a common cause of chorea, basal ganglia are anatomical locations that can cause chorea when a stroke occurs, and chorea is less frequently triggered by a stroke in other anatomical brain regions. Herein, we report a rare case of monochorea after acute contralateral pontine infarction. A 32-year-old man visited the emergency room due to dysarthria and right hemiparesis that occurred approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes before the visit. A brain magnetic resonance image confirmed a diffusion restriction lesion in the left pons. The patient was initially diagnosed with acute infarction at the left pons and began to receive medical treatment with an antiplatelet agent and statin with admission. Approximately 14 hours after the onset of the initial stroke symptoms, the patient complained of involuntary movement in the right arm for the first time. Intermittent, irregular involuntary movements were observed in the distal part of the right arm. This symptom was unpredictable and random, and a similar symptom was not observed in other parts of the patient's body. Clinically, post-stroke monochorea was suspected. The symptom improved from day 5 without specific medical treatment for chorea. The monochorea caused by the pontine lesion in this case was triggered by the direct lesions of the corticospinal tract, and its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. However, abnormal movements can occur due to inadequate downstream activation or inhibition of the corticospinal tract, which is induced by functional abnormalities of the motor cortex. This case suggests that further investigation is needed on the mechanisms of direct corticospinal tract lesions for chorea.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000032660,PMC9857559,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Both patients had previously suffered severe closed head injuries requiring craniotomy for cerebral decompression. Serial brain scans in both cases revealed a newly developing cleft in the midbrain, with features suggestive of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow across the aqueduct. A trial of acetazolamide was initiated to reduce CSF production, followed by a third ventriculostomy for CSF diversion in one patient, which resulted in arrested disease progression and partial recovery. There are only two previous reports in the literature of midbrain clefts that developed as remote sequelae of head trauma. We postulate that altered CSF flow dynamics in the aqueduct, possibly related to changes in brain compliance, may be contributory. Early recognition and treatment may prevent irreversible structural injury and possible death.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2020-238893,PMC7853034,brainstem / cerebellum; cranial nerves; neurological injury; trauma CNS /PNS,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe our experience with two cases of cerebellar hemorrhage after spinal surgery and review the three cases previously reported in the literature to determine whether these cases provide insight regarding the pathogenesis of remote cerebellar hemorrhage. One of our patients developed cerebellar hemorrhage in the vermis and right hemisphere after transpedicular removal of a partially intradural T9-T10 herniated disc with the patient in the prone position. The other patient developed cerebellar hemorrhage in the vermis and bilateral hemispheres after L3-S1 decompression and instrumentation with the patient in the prone position, during which the dura was inadvertently opened. The first patient was treated conservatively and had mild residual dysarthria and gait ataxia 2 months after surgery. The second patient underwent exploration and revision of the lumbar wound with primary dural repair. The cerebellar hemorrhage was treated conservatively, and the patient had mild dysarthria and ataxia 1 month after surgery. Cerebellar hemorrhage must be considered in patients with unexplained neurological deterioration after spinal surgery. Dural opening with loss of cerebrospinal fluid has occurred in every reported case of cerebellar hemorrhage complicating a spinal procedure, supporting the hypothesis that loss of cerebrospinal fluid is central to the pathogenesis of this condition. Because remote cerebellar hemorrhage can occur after procedures with the patient in the supine, sitting, and prone positions, patient positioning seems unlikely to play a causative role in its occurrence.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1097/00006123-200206000-00030,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

This virus is rarely pathogenic in immunocompetent individuals, being associated with profound cellular immunosuppression. We present a case of a 72-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who presented to the emergency department with dysarthria and right hemiataxia. The initial computer tomography was normal and the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was first assumed. However, during hospitalization there was a progressive worsening of symptoms with cerebellar ataxia, and the¬†magnetic resonance revealed a lesion in the right middle cerebellar peduncle hypointense in T1 and hyperintense on T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, suggestive of PML. Although the first cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative, the second one was positive for the JC virus. Furthermore, due to radiological and clinical progression, mirtazapine was started and the patient underwent a course of intravenous immunoglobulin, with no response. In parallel, causes of immunosuppression were investigated, which led to the diagnosis of idiopathic CD8+ lymphocytopenia. Due to rapid progression of symptoms and radiological worsening of lesions, pembrolizumab was administered. After the first administration of pembrolizumab there was a transitory clinical stabilization. However, shortly after the second administration of pembrolizumab, the patient developed stridor with bilateral vocal cord paralysis and subsequent symptom progression, which led to the death of the patient three months after the appearance of initial symptoms. In conclusion, we report a case of a PML in a patient with idiopathic CD8+ lymphocytopenia, enhancing the need for a high suspicion index for this entity as well as for occult and less frequent forms of immunosuppression. Although there have been various case reports of favourable outcomes with pembrolizumab for PML, more research is needed, particularly to identify patient factors that might be associated with better responses to this therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.32870,PMC9867889,hiv-negative progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; idiopathic cd8+ lymphocytopenia; john cunningham virus; pembrolizumab; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,Case Reports,United States,eng

30511425,An autopsy case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy after rituximab therapy for malignant lymphoma.,"Muto, Reiji; Sugita, Yasuo; Momosaki, Seiya; Ito, Yuriko; Wakugawa, Yoshiyuki; Ohshima, Koichi",Muto,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by reactivation of the JC virus (JCV), which is named after the initials of the patient from whom the virus was first isolated. JCV is highly prevalent worldwide, infects humans in early childhood, and the infection persists throughout the course of life in latent form. The present paper deals with the second autopsy case report of rituximab-associated PML in Japan. A 63-year-old woman who had undergone chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed progressive dysarthria and cerebellar ataxia. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed small, scattered, hyperintense areas in the midbrain, pons and thalamus, and the patient was first diagnosed as having cerebral infarction. Follow-up MRI showed tendency toward cerebellar atrophy and multiple system atrophy cerebellar type was suggested, which we concluded must have coincidentally occurred. It was challenging to perform biopsy due to the location of the foci and the patient's condition. Twelve months later she died of aspiration pneumonia caused by the bulbar lesion. At autopsy, the histological examination suggested the presence of demyelinating foci with numerous foamy macrophages. In the foci, oligodendrocytes with enlarged ground-glass like nuclei were found in a scattered manner and astrocytes with bizarre nuclei were also detected. These findings verified the case as PML. The first diagnosis of cerebral infarction was later withdrawn, although appropriate disorders were not recalled even after testing with various antibodies. The rate of PML development tends to increase after treatment with molecular-targeted therapies, which directly or indirectly attenuate the cellular-mediated immune system. Various novel molecular-targeted and immunosuppressive drugs have been released on the market; the cases of PML have consequently increased. Accordingly, pathologists should keep this disease in mind in the differential diagnosis when neural symptoms newly emerge in patients who are treated with these drugs.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12526,,JC virus; demyelinating diseases; leukoencephalopathy; progressive multifocal; rituximab,Case Reports,Australia,eng

37214406,Case report of iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy after exposure to Lyodura: an Australian perspective.,"Muller, Claire",Muller,"Recently proposed diagnostic criteria for iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (iCAA) have sparked increased recognition of cases across the globe. Whilst these patients tend to have a tumultuous course, much like sporadic CAA, there is a high degree of variability. What is unique in this case is the breadth of clinicoradiological data available, including handwritten surgical notes from 1985. In retrospect, early imaging changes of what would ultimately lead to profound morbidity, were apparent 30 years after inoculation with cadaveric dural tissue. In this case study we examine the clinicoradiological features of a case of probable iCAA and draw awareness to the presence of this disease in Australia. This case was admitted under the care of the author at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH). Clinical details and data were gathered during the patient's care and consent for publication provided by the enduring power of attorney. This 56-year-old female presented in 2018 with left hemiparesis, neglect, and dysarthria secondary to a large right frontal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) without an underlying macrovascular cause. MRI brain demonstrated diffuse superficial siderosis assumed related to previous surgical interventions during the mid-1980s for a Chiari malformation and cervical syrinx. There was evidence of extensive white matter disease, discordant with her lack of cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Brain biopsy confirmed CAA. Archived surgical notes confirmed exposure to Lyodura in 1985 and 1986. Two decades of MRI data were available for review and illustrate the evolution of CAA, from normal post-operative findings to marked and unrecognized abnormalities 4 years prior to her first ICH. This is the first Australian case of probable iatrogenic CAA (iCAA) to have such extensive documentation of clinicoradiological evolution. It demonstrates the aggressive course iCAA can take and provides insights into early disease manifestations, relevant to the more common sporadic cases. A brief review of the history of commercial cadaveric tissue use in Australia highlights enormous changes in medical practice over the last 50 years. Awareness within Australia should be raised for this clinical phenomenon, and cases collated to contribute to the growing international pool of evidence.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neuroscience,10.3389/fnins.2023.1185267,PMC10196053,Lyodura; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; hemorrhagic stroke; iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy; intracerebral hemorrhage,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

She had no history of hypertension or other risk factors for stroke. She had a history of lobar ICH in the right parietal lobe 30‚Äâmonths prior. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 29 months after the initial ICH revealed superficial siderosis in the left frontal lobe. She initially presented with severe headache and dysarthria. An initial computed tomography (CT) revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left frontal lobe. One hour later, an epileptic seizure occurred, and another CT performed at the time revealed lobar ICH in the frontal lobe. Emergency surgical hematoma evacuation was performed. The cortical artery was removed from the surgical specimen. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining revealed lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, and immunohistochemical staining revealed abundant amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) deposits. The patient was diagnosed as having CAA-ri. On the next day, and 19, 46, 55, 78, 79, and 85‚Äâdays after admission, ICH recurred. We did not administer immunosuppressive drugs, such as high-dose corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide, because of the patient's condition. Following the last ICH, the patient died on the 90th day after symptom onset. An autopsy was performed. Histologically, abundant AŒ≤ deposits were observed within the leptomeningeal and cortical arteries. Further dense-cored amyloid plaques were observed in the cortical samples. Our findings that ICH occurred initially three times in the left hemispheres and later five times in the right hemispheres were considered immune-mediated effects on vascular function. Further, superficial hemosiderosis in the left frontal lobe occurred before the first three ICH events, and hyperintensity of the white matter on MRI was identified in the right parietal lobe, a typical finding of CAA-ri. We hypothesize that the inflammatory process in CAA-ri may be related to recurrent ICH.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12801,,autopsy; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; cerebral hemorrhage; inflammation; recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Its diagnosis is based on deficits in articulation, prosody, and fluency. It is often described concurrent with aphasia or dysarthria, while pure apraxia of speech is a rare entity. A right-handed man underwent focal surgical resection of a recurrent grade III astrocytoma in the left hemisphere dorsal premotor cortex located in the posterior middle frontal gyrus. After the procedure, he experienced significant long-term speech production difficulties. A battery of standard and custom language and articulatory assessments were administered, revealing intact comprehension and naming abilities, and preserved strength in orofacial articulators, but considerable deficits in articulatory coordination, fluency, and prosody-consistent with diagnosis of pure apraxia of speech.

HZO-initiated cerebral vasculopathy is well characterized; however, there are no documented cases that report the efficacy of surgical revascularization for improving cerebral hemodynamics following progressive HZO-induced vasculopathy. We present a case in which quantitative anatomic and hemodynamic imaging were performed longitudinally before and after surgical revascularization in a patient with HZO and vasculopathic changes. A 57-year-old female with history of right-sided HZO presented with left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria and multiple acute infarcts. Angiography performed serially over a 2-month duration revealed progressive middle cerebral artery stenosis, development of new moyamoya-like lenticulostriate collaterals, and evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in cervical portions of the internal carotid artery. Hemodynamic imaging revealed right hemisphere decreased blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. In addition to medical therapy, right-sided surgical revascularization was performed with the intent to reestablish blood flow. Follow-up imaging 13 months post revascularization demonstrated improved blood flow and vascular reserve capacity in the operative hemisphere, which paralleled symptom resolution. HZO can lead to progressive, symptomatic intracranial stenoses. This report suggests that surgical revascularization techniques can improve cerebral hemodynamics and symptomatology in patients with aggressive disease when medical management is unsuccessful; similar procedures could be considered in managing HZO patients with advanced or progressive vasculopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.12.087,PMC5835181,Bypass; Hemodynamics; Herpes zoster; Intracranial stenosis; Moyamoya; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

PAD involves transient dysfunction in control, coordination and initiation of speech and/or limb movements. To describe the successful use of levetiracetam for the treatment of PAD. Case report. A 37-year-old woman with MS developed PAD approximately 3 months after a multifocal MS relapse. Brain MRI showed a lesion in the posterior aspect of the midbrain as well as in the right posterior internal capsule, both of which were adjacent to the red nucleus. Attack frequency was reduced after starting levetiracetam at a dose of 500mg twice daily, and attacks stopped completely once the dose was increased to 750mg twice daily. Given its advantages (in terms of side effects, safety profile and ease of use compared to other anticonvulsants), we suggest that levetiracetam be considered for management of PAD, and perhaps for other paroxysmal MS symptoms as well.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2016.09.003,,Levetiracetam; Multiple sclerosis; Paroxysmal dysarthria,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Although p-CTA has the advantage of distinguishing between an ischemic penumbra and an infarct core, more research is needed with respect to its clinical use. A healthy 36-year-old man experienced sudden dizziness while swimming. His dizziness persisted irrespective of the change in position, and then improved during transport. He had no neurological abnormality when he arrived at the emergency room. CT perfusion findings suggested left cerebellar infarction. P-CTA revealed a markedly delayed mean transit time, delayed time to peak, and increased cerebral blood volume in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory at admission. However, the diffusion-weighted image (DWI) taken a few hours later revealed a large right cerebellar infarction. Because of the time window, thrombolysis could not be performed and anti-platelet therapy was started. Dysarthria and right-sided limb ataxia were newly developed before DWI (after p-CTA). Persistent foramen ovale was detected through transesophageal echography and identified as the cause of the stroke.

32754407,"A Rare Case of a Large, Deceitfully Quiet Brainstem Arteriovenous Malformation Presenting Only as Dizziness.","Rao, Swathi; Giron, Fanny",Rao,"Dizziness is one of the most frequent complaints encountered in the medical practice affecting 15%-20% of adults yearly, and can be challenging to assess. Most patients use dizziness as a non-specific term, and thus suffer prejudice from the physicians' end and can be disregarded frequently. Dizziness can be a symptom of various diseases, some with sinister pathologies. We present a case of garden-variety vertigo that unfurled to be not-so-simple, emphasizing the importance of a thorough history and physical examination again even in the era of technology. A 32-year-old male patient with no past medical history presented with dizziness, later clarified as gradually progressive vertigo for two years, with unstable gait, dysarthria, and occasional diplopia. Physical examination found sustained nystagmus that changed direction with horizontal gaze, vertical nystagmus with upward gaze, dysarthria, and a wide-based ataxic gait. CT head without contrast revealed indeterminate hypodense areas in the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellar hemisphere. MRI brain identified a 2.8 x 3.4 x 4.2 cm Spetzler-Martin grade IV brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. Feeders were mostly from the posterior circulation, with three intranidal aneurysms, all draining into the deep venous system. The AVM was deemed inoperable, and the patient was treated with onyx embolization for two/three feeding vessel aneurysms. After treatment, the symptoms persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) six months after diagnosis, and was admitted a year later with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder. Brain AVMs are rare clinical entities that present in 0.1% of the population, mostly presenting as intracranial bleeds. When they do rarely present with isolated focal neurologic deficits, it has been attributed to a vascular steal phenomenon, hemorrhage, or a mass effect.¬†The isolated findings of vertigo and dysarthria are highly non-specific; with such presentation, clinicians should consider etiologies under the realm of vertigo of central origin. An untreatable AVM reduces patients' quality of life and has been linked to depression and anxiety, and thus patients may benefit from psychosocial therapy. Although preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary concern with brain AVMs, the rest of the patient's profile should not be forgotten.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.8870,PMC7387078,arteriovenous malformation; dizziness; nystagmus; vertigo,Case Reports,United States,eng

The patient presented with progressive left-sided deafness and left-sided facial palsy lasting less than 2 months and progressive dysarthria and dysphagia lasting 2 weeks. Preoperative neuroimaging suggested the diagnosis of CPA meningioma with ""dural-tail"" sign and involvement of the internal auditory canal. Serological examination showed an increase in the malignant markers of ferritin and neuron-specific enolase, which suggested underlying malignancy. The tumor was subtotally removed, and it was confirmed to be completely separated from the brainstem and cerebellum. Cranial nerves VII and VIII were destroyed and sacrificed. Transient severe bradycardia occurred during surgery due to entrapment of the caudal cranial nerve complex by the tumor in such an infiltrative way. The neuropathological examination revealed a glioblastoma. The patient underwent no further treatment and died of cachexia 2 months postoperatively. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case of a primary glioblastoma in the CPA in an adult.

In this study, we report a new case of a patient who had taken 1,000 mg ornidazole daily for nearly 4 years because of suspected diarrhea and proctitis and presented with subacute symptoms such as unsteady gait, slurred speech, and psychiatric disorder. These symptoms were significantly relieved 3 days after the patient stopped taking ornidazole. When he took this medicine again, however, similar symptoms occurred 4 months later, which were again reduced after 4 days of drug discontinuation. After the second onset, abnormal signals were identified around the aqueduct of the midbrain, around the fourth ventricle, and in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum bilaterally. After 9 days of drug discontinuation, lesions disappeared in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. According to the clinical manifestations, imaging features, and the reduced symptoms after drug withdrawal, we clinically diagnosed the patient with OIE. This paper also reviews the literature on OIE. Only five cases (including our case) have been reported, all of whom presented with cerebellar ataxia and dysarthria and three with additional mental symptoms such as agitation and irritability. All five patients had abnormal lesions in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum bilaterally, among whom four also had lesions in the corpus callosum and three around the periaqueduct of the midbrain. After withdrawal of ornidazole, the symptoms in all patients vanished or were alleviated, and three of them showed reduced or disappeared lesions in a head MRI reexamination. Overall, OIE has rarely been reported. Our case report and literature review show that the lesions in the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and brainstem can be reversed. The main manifestations of the lesions-cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and mental symptoms-quickly weaken or disappear after drug withdrawal, with good prognosis. Nevertheless, clear pathogenesis has yet to be further investigated.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.706094,PMC8458754,MRI; ataxia; dentate nucleus; ornidazole-induced encephalopathy; toxicity,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The most frequently encountered problems are dysarthria, aphasia, dysphagia and apraxia of speech. Although these disorders are mentioned in literature, very few studies describing the occurrence in different neurological conditions are available in Indian context. Hence, a need was felt to carry out such a study. A heterogenous group of forty patients with neurological conditions were assessed for presence of speech, language and swallowing problems. A percent analysis was carried out to determine the occurrence of aphasia, dysarthria and dysphagia in general, in specific diseases and also to describe type of aphasia and dysarthria according to the characteristics presented. It was seen that the most frequently occurring disorder was dysarthria (60%), followed by dysphagia (55%) and aphasia (18%). It was also noted that dysarthria and dysphagia co-existed in around 45% patients with neurological diseases. It can be concluded that speech, language and swallowing problems are frequent in individuals with neurological conditions.

The current case expands the spectrum of symptoms in PDA syndrome, which was including but not limited to dysarthria and ataxia. Caudal paramedian midbrain lesions involving decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles appear to be critical for PDA syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of neuroimmunology,10.1016/j.jneuroim.2020.577327,,Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies; Midbrain; Paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia; Paroxysmal symptoms,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",Netherlands,eng

It has been mainly reported in multiple sclerosis and an association with midbrain lesions has been claimed; however, most of the reported patients had multiple brain alterations so it was difficult to associate this symptom with a specific lesion site. We illustrate the cases of two patients with an isolated demyelinating midbrain lesion presenting paroxysmal dysarthria as the only symptom; both participants had oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and an unremarkable follow-up. Both patients had benefit from carbamazepine treatment, similarly to previously reported cases. Our report confirms that a demyelinating midbrain lesion is sufficient to provoke paroxysmal dysarthria. It is noteworthy that an erroneous diagnosis of psychogenic disorders was initially made in both cases, highlighting the importance not to underestimate isolated paroxysmal symptoms in clinical practice.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2013-200777,PMC3822091,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

He was thus diagnosed with an acute phase of cardioembolic stroke. Subsequently, the right eye adduction palsy in the forward gaze was slightly improved, but other eye movement disorders persisted during discharge from the hospital. The pathology was suspected to involve bilateral damages to both medial longitudinal fasciculus and the paramedian pontine reticular formation. WEBINO syndrome was not only ascribed to lacunar infarction and large artery atherosclerosis but also cardioembolic stroke.

Thirteen cases (11 men and 2 women) of BMCPI were identified. A high-intensity signal of diffusion-weighted imaging sequence involving the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle was observed in all patients. Most patients experienced vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia, and hearing disorders. Eleven of these cases were classified as large artery atherosclerosis, one as traumatic vertebral artery (VA) dissection, and one as giant cell arteritis. BMCPI is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by vertigo, ataxia, and dysarthria, which may also be accompanied by a hearing deficit or clinical signs of brainstem damage.

Acoustic measurements revealed increased pitch, monotonous speech, rough voice quality, and normal speech tempo concomitant with articulatory impreciseness in terms of incomplete closure productions. This constellation resembled parkinsonian dysarthria. Damage to the thalamic projection area of the pallidal efferents, therefore, seems to be the most probable cause of the patient's speech disorders.

However, significant improvements in the participant's ability to achieve improved speech naturalness through enhanced control of prosodic elements and more comprehensible speech were evident. The participant also demonstrated an improved level of functioning on selected domains of the ICF. The results of this study indicate that elements of Smooth Speech Therapy may prove effective in the treatment of ataxic dysarthria, particularly in the treatment of prosodic defects.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050902997888,,,Case Reports; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,England,eng
8746751,Resolution of dysarthria in multiple sclerosis by treatment with weak electromagnetic fields.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"It has been reported that 50% or more of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibit speech impairment (dysarthria) which in some cases can be exceedingly disabling. Currently there is no effective medical treatment for the dysarthria of MS which occurs as a result of lesions to the cerebellum and its outflow tracts. It was reported recently that extracranial application of brief AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range intensity produced in patients with MS sustained improvement in motor functions including cerebellar symptomatology. This communication concerns two MS patients with a chronic progressive course who exhibited severe dysarthria which improved already during the initial treatment with pulsed EMFs and which resolved completely 3-4 weeks later. Since application of EMFs has been shown to alter: (a) the resting membrane potential and synaptic neurotransmitter release through an effect involving changes in transmembrane calcium flux; and (b) the secretion of pineal melatonin which in turn influences the synthesis and release of serotonin (5-HT) and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the cerebellum, it is suggested that the immediate improvement of the dysarthria occurred as a result of changes in cerebellar neurotransmitter functions particularly 5-HT and GABA rather than from remyelination.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459508986327,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The pathophysiology of FAS is not yet understood. A 68-year-old Italian man was admitted to the EmergencyDepartment for non-fluent aphasia and dysarthria. Computed tomography (CT) scan did not show abnormalities; the patient was treated with systemic thrombolysis. A repeated brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an infarct in the left primary motor cortex and mild extension to cortico-subcortical frontal regions. In the following days he gradually improved, speaking Italian fluently with a typical German accent. In conclusion, FAS is a rare motor speech disorder, often related to cerebrovascular accidents involving critical regions in the dominant hemisphere. In addition, the present case adds further evidence to the role of the left primary motor cortex in modulation of prosody.

At each session, first a light-emitting diode (LED) cluster head with red (630 and 660‚Äânm) and near-infrared (850‚Äânm) wavelengths, with an irradiance (power density) of 200‚ÄâmW/cm<sup>2</sup>, a beam size of 4.9‚Äâcm<sup>2</sup>, and a fluence (energy density) of 12‚ÄâJ/cm<sup>2</sup> per minute, was applied to the left side of the scalp/brain, along the Sylvian fissure for 60‚Äâsec at each at the following eight, language network target areas: frontal pole, prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area); supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus in the parietal lobe; inferior motor/sensory cortex (mouth area); and posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and superior temporal sulcus in the temporal lobe, for a total of 8‚Äâmin. Second, for the next 20‚Äâmin (1200‚Äâsec), simultaneous with speech-language therapy, an LED PBM helmet was applied to the scalp/head. This helmet contained 256 separate LED lights, near-infrared (810‚Äânm) wavelength, 60‚ÄâmW power per LED light, total power, 15 W; energy, 72 Joules; fluence, 28.8‚ÄâJ/cm<sup>2</sup>; and irradiance, 24‚ÄâmW/cm<sup>2</sup>. <b><i>Results and conclusions:</i></b> During the initial, 5-month treatment series with traditional speech-language therapy only, there was little to no improvement in dysarthria and expressive language. During the second, 5-month treatment series, however, with tPBM applied first, to the left hemisphere only, and second, to both hemispheres during each session plus simultaneous speech-language therapy, there was marked improvement in the dysarthria and expressive language. After the first 5-month series, this PWA had utilized a slow rate of speech with a production of ‚àº25 to 30 words-per-minute during conversations and spontaneous speech. Utterance length was only 4-6 words with simple, grammatical structure. After the second, 5-month series of treatment combining tPBM plus speech-language therapy, the rate of speech increased to 80+ words-per-minute and utterance length was increased to 9-10 words, with more complex grammatical structure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,"Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",10.1089/photob.2022.0024,PMC10171962,LLLT; PBM; aphasia; low-level laser therapy; photobiomodulation; speech-language therapy,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The condition is caused by an epileptogenic lesion involving the opercular cortex of either hemisphere. Speech impairment is secondary to bilateral epileptic activity affecting the glossopharyngeal muscles. This bilateral nature of the condition is due to the fact that innervation of cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X and XII from the opercular area of the primary motor cortex is bilateral. The aetiology of the condition varies, and includes vascular lesions, tumours, and encephalitis, among other causes. A low threshold for clinical suspicion is necessary in order to ensure the timely initiation of antiepileptic treatment, thereby preventing the condition from becoming drug resistant.

Millard-Gubler syndrome is a clinical syndrome which occurs following lesions involving the ventral portion of the caudal pons, resulting in classic clinical features such as ipsilateral abducens and facial nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis. We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient having presented to the Yehuleshet Specialty Clinic 6 years back with sudden-onset dysarthria and appendicular ataxia of 10 days duration. He reported having right hemibody weakness and blurred vision, which have significantly improved since then. He had a history of smoking of 30 pack-years. However, he quit smoking 8 years ago. There was no history of prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, diabetes, hypertension, head trauma, or dyslipidemia. On examination, he had horizontal left gaze palsy with horizontal nystagmus suggesting left-sided 6th cranial nerve palsy. He had mild left-sided facial palsy causing dysarthric speech. Right upper limb dysmetria was observed during examination; otherwise, motor, sensory, fundus, and gait examination results were normal. He had low serum vitamin D. Brain magnetic resonance imaging examination showed a 25 √ó 10 mm segmental lesion in the left median pons involving the basis pontis and tegmentum section. The lesion had T2 and T1 abnormal prolongation with no diffusion restriction, suggesting a subacute pontine infarct. The patient was managed with aspirin 325 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, physical therapy, and vitamin D supplementation, and advised on behavioral risk factors. Six years after his isolated pontine infarction, the patient is fully recovered from dysarthria, facial palsy, hemiparesis, right-sided appendicular ataxia, and horizontal nystagmus, and the follow-up brain MRI showed radiological evidence of chronic paramedian pontine perforator infarction. Millard-Gubler syndrome may present with cerebellar ataxia if the paramedian pontine infarction area slightly extends laterally, affecting the middle cerebellar peduncles. Isolated pontine infarction may have a good prognosis if diagnosed and managed early.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000515330,PMC8077373,Ataxia; Ethiopia; Nystagmus; Pontine infarction; Stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Commonly reported serotonergic side-effects include nausea, headache, dizziness, nervousness and orthostatic hypotension. Trazodone, a non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is often used in conjunction with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in order to combat the insomnia associated with fluoxetine. Successful use of this combination is generally limited by the cumulative serotonergic side-effects of the two medications. This paper describes the first reported case of speech dysfunction as a complication of combined trazodone and fluoxetine use. A 43-year-old male suffered bilateral wrist fractures and a moderate TBI during a fall. Within 1 week of adding fluoxetine to trazodone the patient developed new-onset dysarthria and speech blocking. Upon discontinuation of fluoxetine, speech returned to normal. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of hepatic metabolism, unmasking of caudate nucleus injury, increased noradrenergic activity or previously unreported serotonergic effects.

Neurologically, mild right-sided brachiofacial hemiparesis and grasp reflexes - a frontal lobe sign - were observed. As his micrographia and hypophonia improved, the patient's grasp reflexes improved in parallel. In addition, recovery of regional cerebral blood flow in the left frontal lobe was confirmed by single photon emission computed tomography (technetium-99 m HMPAO).

25322939,Stroke recovery and lesion reduction following acute isolated bilateral ischaemic pontine infarction: a case report.,"Varsou, Ourania; Stringer, Michael S; Fernandes, Catarina Dinis; Schwarzbauer, Christian; MacLeod, Mary Joan",Varsou,"Although pontine strokes account for a small percentage of all ischaemic events, they can be associated with significant initial disability. These lesions may be missed on computed tomography and therefore magnetic resonance imaging is generally preferred for the assessment of brainstem strokes. The aetiopathogenesis of isolated pontine infarcts, not due to a significant compromise (occlusion or dissection) in the vertebrobasilar territory, still remains to be fully characterised. These strokes present with different symptoms, depending on the lesion location and size, partly reflecting the anatomical variability of the vertebrobasilar vessels. Progressive neurological deterioration is relatively common and has been associated with the extension of such lesions. However, many patients with significant infarcts in the pons will do well in the future and initial diffusion-weighted imaging may not add useful prognostication to the clinical assessment. We discuss here a case where an initially progressive presentation was associated with a marked improvement in both clinical and radiological assessments at 42 days. A 49-year-old white British man presented with left-sided weakness, incoordination, unsteadiness, cerebellar ataxic dysarthria and dysphonia. A baseline magnetic resonance imaging scan with diffusion-weighted imaging, T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences showed an acute bilateral pontine infarct. On a repeat scan at 42 days, there was a 57.5% decrease in the size of the lesion on the high-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted image and a corresponding improvement in the symptoms and the clinical assessments of this patient. The reduction in infarct size was also comparable to the decrease calculated between the baseline diffusion-weighted and the follow-up fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences. This case report discusses the significant clinical improvement and corresponding lesion reduction in a patient that presented with worsening neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with acute bilateral ischaemic pontine infarction. Further studies, utilising structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging with follow-up scans, are needed to provide better insights into the underlying aetiopathology and recovery mechanisms of pontine stroke. These will help define the relationship between imaging parameters and outcome allowing for better prognosis along with the development of relevant rehabilitation programs for this group of patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMC research notes,10.1186/1756-0500-7-728,PMC4203895,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Computed tomography cisternogram confirmed communication with the ventricular system, and there was no clinical evidence for elevated CSF pressure. One month later, the patient's symptoms had not improved, and imaging revealed progression of the CSF cleft. Following placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, progression of the cleft ceased.

12105684,[Central nervous system involvement in patients with HCV-related cryoglobulinemia: literature review and a case report].,"Filippini, D; Colombo, F; Jann, S; Cornero, R; Canesi, B",Filippini,"Few well-documented cases of central nervous system involvement in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and/or HCV infection have been reported. We can distinguish between acute or subacute diffuse and focal lesions (transient ischemic attack-like syndromes and cerebrovascular accidents). A search of two electronic databases (Medline and EMBASE) was conducted from the year of their inception (1966 for Medline and 1988 for EMBASE) to September 2000. The search strategy employed entailed combining these terms: Cryoglobulinemia, Central Nervous System, Hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis. Cryoglobulinemia and Central Nervous System were also used as free test words. We analysed articles with case reports and the most frequent articles on the references list. The main pathophysiologic mechanism of cerebral involvement is ischemia (or rarely hemorrhage) due to diffuse or segmental vasculitis of the small cerebral vessels. In these cases a brain MRI usually shows single or multiple increased T2 signals. Furthermore an occasional occlusive vasculopathy without vasculitis was documented histologically. In these patients ischemia could be started or enhanced by the engorgement of the microvasculature by clumps of red cells and by aggregates of cryoglobulins. In the same patients vasculitis and hemorheological abnormalities can affect the clinical picture of the cerebral involvement in mixed cryoglobulinemia. Finally, the detection of HCV in the lesions induces a hypothesis that, in some cases, CNS involvement could be directly related to chronic HCV infection, even in the absence of cryoglobulin production. We describe a 63 year-old woman with acute severe encephalopathy. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high positive test result for rheumatoid factor (3390 U/ml) and hypocomplementemia (C4 less than 1.67 mg/dl). Protein immunofixation electrophoresis demonstrated 5% monoclonal proteins (IgM/k and IgG/k), 3% cryoglobulins were present, HCV antibody and HCV-RNA (type 2a-2c) were positive. Cryoglobulins were never typed, because they disappeared after plasma exchanges. Liver enzymes, renal function and findings on cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cerebral CT and MRI were also normal. Antinuclear antibodies, anti nDNA antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, ANCA, Lyme disease serology, complete tests for thrombophilia were negative. Bone aspiration was normal. The patient, in coma, was treated with two plasma exchanges. During the first treatment she recovered consciousness. Prednisone (1 mg/Kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg iv for three days) were added. After a week two plasma exchanges were performed again. Liver enzymes and rheumatoid factor were analysed monthly for six months and than every two months for another six month period up to the present. Liver enzymes were always normal, rheumatoid factor was always at a lower level than the first evaluation (now it's 311 U/ml). At present she is taking Prednisone 5 mg once a day, neurologic symptoms are absent and neurologic examination is normal. We can conclude that: central neurologic involvement may be the clinical presentation of HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia. HCV serologic tests and cryoglobulins should be considered in patient with encephalopathy of non-obvious cause; plasma exchange is the treatment of choice in acute severe forms; in some patients HCV could involve directly CNS, even in the absence of cryoglobulin production.",{},,Reumatismo,10.4081/reumatismo.2002.150,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Italy,ita

37407260,Pearls & Oy-sters: Cognitive and Affective Dysfunction Caused by a Small Cerebellar Hemangioblastoma.,"Inoue, Mizuho; Oya, Soichi; Yamaga, Tetsuo; Tajima, Takashi; Hanakita, Shunya",Inoue,"The primary function of the cerebellum is the coordination and regulation of movement; therefore, cerebellar tumors usually present with ataxia, dysarthria, and vertigo. Large tumors also cause elevated intracranial pressure that may lead to a disturbance of consciousness. Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident that the cerebellum plays a substantial role in cognitive and affective processing. A 44-year-old female patient presented with a 1-month history of depression and flat affect. She had no cerebellar symptoms including no coordination dysfunction or dysarthria. Cognitive function tests revealed impairments in attention, execution, and processing speed. Hamilton Depression Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale indicated moderate-to-severe depression. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a 7-mm enhancing lesion in the culmen of the cerebellar vermis with surrounding edema. Technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion in the left frontal lobe. Although she was initially treated with corticosteroids for presumed sero-negative autoimmune encephalitis, her symptoms persisted. She then underwent cerebellar lesion resection. The histologic diagnosis was hemangioblastoma. The patient's symptoms dramatically improved within 1 week of resection, including improved batteries for cognitive function and depression. Complete regression of cerebellar edema and left frontal lobe hypoperfusion was observed on MR and SPECT images, respectively. This case reiterates the crucial influence of the cerebellum on cognitive and affective function. Moreover, cognitive dysfunction may be masked in cases with focal cerebellar symptoms or elevated intracranial pressure and, consequently, not adequately evaluated.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000207509,PMC10516281,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
1844815,Neurogenic stuttering as a manifestation of stroke and a mask of dysphonia.,"Rao, P R",Rao,"R. L. was a 52-year-old man who was referred for an SLP consultation to determine the nature of his fluency disorder, whether or not treatment would be beneficial, and finally whether resumption of pre-trauma vocational status was feasible. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident with no resulting detectable trauma. However, shortly after the accident, R. L. developed a severe dysfluency that was later described as cortical stuttering. We reviewed the medical and rehabilitation work-up that attempted to determine whether the communication disorder was functional or organic in origin. Once the fluency disorder was determined to be caused by a suspected small, focal, hemispheric lesion, a five-month treatment program was undertaken that used a noval prosthetic approach to restore fluency. Once fluency was restored with the use of an artificial larynx, a residual anomia was detected and treated. The case of R. L. illustrates a stuttering that appeared to be caused by a combined neurogenic dyspraxic (vocal control), dysarthric (motor control), and dysnomic (word-finding) dysfluency. The literature on this issue was reviewed and the underlying mechanism of recovery was discussed.",{},,Clinics in communication disorders,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Even though they are known complications of surgically treated intracerebral haemorrhages (ICH), the presence of a brain abscess at the site of an untreated ICH is a rare event. Such cases may result from haematogenous spread from distant foci or contiguous sites and are often preceded by episodes of sepsis and local infection. Immunodeficiency, AIDS, age, diabetes mellitus and vitamin-K deficiency are predisposing factors. Abscess formation should be considered in case of clinical deterioration, headache, and any neurological deficit after febrile episodes. Early diagnosis with neuroradiological imaging, infection blood markers and microbiological identification of the causative pathogen is crucial for treatment with surgical drainage or excision and specific antibiotic therapy, which guarantee good outcome and long-term survival. In fact, while prompt diagnosis and treatment guarantee good outcome and long-term survival, morbidity and mortality are very high in case of misdiagnosis.

T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed hyperintensities in the right lateral pons and right middle cerebral peduncle and a possible abnormality of the left middle cerebellar peduncle. A magnetic resonance angiogram showed moderately severe stenosis of the distal vertebral artery and middle third of the basilar artery. The patient's right limb coordination and gait improved steadily over several weeks, but there was no improvement in hearing in his right ear. The relatively isolated onset of deafness as well as the severity and persistence of the hearing loss led us to conclude that the hearing loss in this case was likely due to prominent hypoperfusion of the internal auditory artery, with labyrinthine infarction as the earliest event.

The natural history of CPAs indicates a lower risk for hemorrhage compared to brain AVMs. A 62-year-old woman presented with gait instability and dysarthria. MRI and angiography revealed a diffuse vascular network involving the tectum and cerebellar vermis with intermingled brain parenchyma. This lesion had no dominant feeder, high-flow arteriovenous shunt, flow-related aneurysm or highly dilated veins on angiogram. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of CPA. During follow-up, she developed progressive gait instability and eye movement abnormalities, but no remarkable change was detected on the repeated MRI and angiography. Nine years later, she died of mesencephalic hemorrhage originating from the CPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a patient with CPA who died as a result of the initial hemorrhage.

Using a 160-channel whole-head-type magnetoencephalographic system, cerebral magnetic fields were obtained pre- and postoperatively from 5 patients with unilateral internal carotid artery occlusive disease and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers. For quantitative imaging, voxel-based time-averaged intensities of slow waves in 4 frequency bands (0.3-2 Hz, 2-4 Hz, 4-6 Hz and 6-8 Hz) were obtained by the proposed technique based on sLORETA-qm. Positron emission tomography with (15)O gas inhalation ((15)O-PET) was also performed in these patients to evaluate cerebral blood flow and metabolism. In all 5 patients, slow waves in every frequency band were distributed in the area of cerebrovascular insufficiency, as confirmed by (15)O-PET preoperatively. In 4 patients, slow-wave intensities in theta bands (4-6 Hz, 6-8 Hz) decreased postoperatively along with improvements in cerebral blood flow and metabolism, whereas delta bands (0.3-2 Hz, 2-4 Hz) showed no significant differences between pre- and postoperatively. One patient with deterioration of cerebral infarction after surgery showed marked increases in slow-wave intensities in delta bands (0.3-2 Hz, 2-4 Hz) postoperatively, with distribution close to the infarct region.

Twelve clinical signs were scored on a 6-point scale, neuroimaging lesions were mapped and defined with statistical certainty, and structure-function correlation was performed to develop a topographic map of motor function. Clinical findings ranged from major devastation following extensive lesions (pure motor hemiplegia) to incomplete basilar pontine syndrome and restricted deficits after small focal lesions (ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, dysarthria-dysmetria and dysarthria-facial paresis). The syndromes are not absolutely discrete, and are distinguished from each other by the relative degree of involvement of each clinical feature. Structure-function correlations indicate that strength is conveyed by the corticofugal fibres destined for the spinal cord, whereas dysmetria results from lesions involving the neurons of the basilar pons that link the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Facial movement and articulation are localized to rostral and medial basilar pons; hand coordination is medial and ventral in rostral and mid-pons; and arm function is represented ventral and lateral to the hand. Leg coordination is in the caudal half of the pons, with lateral predominance. Swallowing is dependent upon the integrity of a number of regions in the rostral pons. Gait is in medial and lateral locations throughout the rostral- caudal extent of the pons. Dysmetria ipsilateral to the lesion constitutes a disconnection syndrome, as it occurs when the hemipontine lesion is extensive and interrupts pontocerebellar fibres traversing from the opposite, intact side of the pons. The heterogeneity of manifestations reflects the well-organized topography of motor function in the human basis pontis, in agreement with the anatomic organization of the motor corticopontine projections in the monkey. Higher order impairments including motor neglect, paraphasic errors and pathological laughter result from rostral and medial pontine lesions, and may result from disruption of the pontine component of associative corticopontocerebellar circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh138,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

30579022,Multiple Brain Metastases from Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Manifesting with Simultaneous Intratumoral Hemorrhages.,"Matsuo, Satoshi; Amano, Toshiyuki; Kawauchi, Shigeto; Nakamizo, Akira",Matsuo,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma rarely metastasizes to the brain, and clinical features of brain metastasis in such cases remain elusive. To the best of our knowledge, only 21 cases of brain metastasis from pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been previously reported in the English language literature. A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and began chemotherapy 1 year 4 months before the current admission. Three days before the current admission, she developed acute dysarthria. She was referred to a cancer center, where neuroradiologic examination showed multiple metastatic brain tumors, including a 30-mm-diameter tumor in the right cerebellar region. She was transferred to our institute. Three days after admission, she developed sudden-onset disturbance of consciousness and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed that the metastatic lesions had increased in size with development of intratumoral hemorrhage and obstructive hydrocephalus. She underwent urgent removal of the tumor in the cerebellum. Obstructive hydrocephalus was relieved, and her consciousness improved immediately after surgery. She was transferred to the palliative care unit of the cancer center and died under hospice care 3 weeks after surgery. This case demonstrates that brain metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma can enlarge suddenly and simultaneously with intratumoral hemorrhage even without coagulation disorders, resulting in neurologic deterioration in a short time. Surgical resection of metastatic brain lesions from pancreatic adenocarcinoma has an extremely limited role, but such treatment can remove neurologic symptoms and temporarily improve the patient's quality of life in selected cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2018.12.036,,Intratumoral hemorrhage; Metastatic brain tumor; Pancreatic adenocarcinoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, it is unclear whether people with acquired communication disorders can and do make similar adaptations. This study investigated the impact of different conversational settings on the intelligibility of a speaker with acquired communication difficulties. Twenty-eight assessors listened to recordings of the speaker reading aloud 40 words and 32 sentences to a listener who was either face-to-face or unseen. The speaker's ability to convey information was measured by the accuracy of assessors' orthographic transcriptions of the words and sentences. Assessors' scores were significantly higher in the unseen condition for the single word task particularly if they had heard the face-to-face condition first. Scores for the sentence task were significantly higher in the second presentation regardless of the condition. The results from this study suggest that therapy conducted in situations where the client is not able to see their conversation partner may encourage them to perform at a higher level and increase the clarity of their speech. Readers will be able to describe: (1) the range of conversational adjustments made by speakers without communication difficulties; (2) differences between these tasks in offering contextual information to the listener; and (3) the potential for using challenging communicative situations to improve the performance of adults with communication disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of communication disorders,10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.08.002,,Acquired communication difficulties; Intelligibility; Speaker adaptation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A rare form of primary lateral sclerosis.,"Gastaut, J L; Michel, B; Figarella-Branger, D; Somma-Mauvais, H",Gastaut,"Although it was first described over a century ago (by Charcot in 1865; by Erb in 1875), the concept of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is still not universally accepted. Despite this skepticism, several well-documented cases of isolated degeneration with varying degrees of involvement of corticospinal pyramidal pathways have been reported in the literature. The clinical manifestations in these cases can take one of two forms, ie, isolated spasmodic paraplegia or tetraplegia on the one hand or spasmodic tetraplegia associated with a pseudobulbar syndrome featuring severe spastic dysarthria (chronic progressive bilateral spinobulbar spasticity) on the other hand. Obviously, without firm pathologic data, PLS is a hazardous diagnosis for isolated paraplegia or tetraplegia. Conversely, for bilateral spinobulbar spasticity, it would appear to be the only diagnosis possible once investigate findings have eliminated the other possibilities, such as a pyramidal form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or a spinal form of multiple sclerosis. To underscore this point, in this report, five cases of chronic progressive bilateral spinobulbar spasticity developed over 5, 10, 12, 10, and 28 years, respectively, for which the only possible diagnosis was PLS. It was concluded that there are three forms of degenerative diseases of the principal motor pathways: one involving both central and peripheral neurons, ie, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; one involving only peripheral neurons, ie, spinal amyotrophy; and one involving only central motor neurons, ie, PLS.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1988.00520290037011,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient improved with conservative therapy, including intravenous administration of glycerol. We speculate that our patient likely had initial transient occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which probably gave rise to the bilateral medial branches of posterior inferior cerebellar arteries.

DWI demonstrated incomplete infarction within the left lenticulostriate artery (LSA) territory, MRA showed partial flow defect in the distal left M1 segment and non-visualization of the LSA, and ECG revealed atrial fibrillation, thus ischemic stroke caused by cardiogenic embolism was diagnosed. Tissue plasminogen activator was administered, but symptoms progressed and NIHSS score increased up to 8. Diagnostic angiogrpahy confirmed presence of the subocclusive thrombus within the distal left M1 segment and complete occlusion of LSA at its origin.

29066662,Dysphagia management in bilateral frontal opercular syndrome (Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome).,"Richards, Thomas; Hughes, Thomas Tudor; Moss, Jake; Lomax, Tessa",Richards,"An 80-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with acute anarthria and severe dysphagia, characterised by loss of voluntary control of the muscles of facial expression, mastication, bolus manipulation (tongue) and pharyngeal constriction, with relative preservation of involuntary movements. Brain imaging revealed an acute infarct in the left frontal operculum and an area of gliosis consistent with an old infarct in the right frontal operculum. A clinical and radiological diagnosis of bilateral anterior frontal opercular syndrome (Foix-Chavany-Marie-syndrome) was made.Deglutition consists of a voluntary oral stage and an involuntary pharyngeal and oesophageal phase. As involuntary movements were relatively preserved and no sensory loss was suspected, it was hypothesised that, once initiated or triggered, pharyngeal swallowing could be adequate. This was trialled at the bedside without adverse effects and subsequently videofluoroscopy demonstrated timely laryngeal elevation and closure, adequate opening of the upper oesophageal sphincter and smooth transit of the bolus from mouth to oesophagus. Oral intake was restored within days of admission and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was avoided. This is the first time to the authors' knowledge that this management approach has been described for this condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2017-222363,PMC5665189,brain stem / cerebellum; cranial nerves; parenteral / enteral feeding; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

31875786,Successful thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in ischemic stroke after idarucizumab administration for reversal of dabigatran: a case report.,"Ohtani, Toshiyuki; Sintoku, Ryosuke; Yajima, Tasuku; Kaneko, Naoyuki",Ohtani,"Idarucizumab is a specific antidote for the anticoagulant dabigatran. Although its efficacy has been recently reported, the drug is still in postmarketing surveillance and requires case data in different emergency settings. A newer intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has been proposed after injection of idarucizumab in patients receiving dabigatran; however, the safety and efficacy of this therapy are equivocal because of the limited number of reported cases. We describe a case of a patient with acute lacunar stroke causing dysarthria and hemiparesis successfully treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after reversal of dabigatran with idarucizumab. A 67-year-old Asian woman was transferred to our emergency center 200‚Äâminutes after sudden onset of dysarthria and right-sided hemiparesis. She had been taking dabigatran for prevention of stroke recurrence caused by atrial fibrillation. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed a new lacunar infarction near old putamen infarctions. We treated her with intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after administering idarucizumab. The time to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator administration was 5‚Äâminutes from idarucizumab injection and 269‚Äâminutes from symptom onset. The patient's activated partial thromboplastin times were 68.0 and 43.2‚Äâseconds before and after the therapy, respectively. The patient's neurological symptoms improved significantly after the treatment, and she experienced no adverse events. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after reversal of dabigatran with idarucizumab may be safe and feasible in patients with acute ischemic stroke with lacunar infarct. Furthermore, intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator could be used in patients in emergency settings until just before the end of the recommended time limit within which it needs to be administered because of the immediate effect of idarucizumab.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-019-2326-y,PMC6931249,Direct oral anticoagulants; Lacunar stroke; Thrombolysis,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with an open craniofacial wound resulting from an attack with an axe. The initial CT scan found fractures in the left zygomatic, sphenoidal and maxillary arches, as well as pneumocephalus in the cavernous sinuses and the right carotid canal. One hour later, the patient showed a neurological deficit in the right hemisphere, and so a new cranial computed tomography scan with multimodal vascular study was urgently requested, which revealed the mobilisation of the pneumocephalus and ruled out a large vessel arterial occlusion. A shunt study using transcranial Doppler and echocardiography showed the presence of a patent foramen ovale to be the cause of arteriovenous communication that justified an arterial gas embolism. The follow-up CT scan at 48 hours confirmed the appearance of a right parietal ischaemic lesion. This case reflects the simultaneous presence of air in the arterial and venous circulation of the brain, as well as the peripheral communication through a patent foramen ovale.

The tumor was found involving the cerebellar vermis and the right hemisphere, protruding upward from the superior surface of the cerebellum. Horizontal sections through the cerebellum disclosed a well circumscribed tumor with adjacent hematomas involving the vermis and brain stem. The pathological diagnosis was hemangioblastoma and varix-like abnormal vessels were observed within the tumor. The sites of hematoma and tumor adjacent to the tentorial incisura and the history of VP shunting may suggest that upward herniation played a significant role in rupture of the abnormal vessels, which then led to the devastating hemorrhage in this particular case.",{},,No shinkei geka.

Ultimately, it was determined that the patient had a selective impairement of phonation or laryngeal apraxia. This was illustrated dramatically when he was taught to use an electrolarynx which allowed him to bypass his disrupted phonatory system. Speaking with the electrolarynx, the patient communicated normally. Any semblance of Broca's aphasia disappeared. Supralaryngeal articulation was normal; apraxia of speech behaviors were absent.

A 44-year-old right-handed man suffered from a cerebral infarction with a mild right hemiparesis and speech disturbance. An MRI of the brain 1.5 months post onset revealed a lesion confined to the left central gyrus. One month after the onset, his spontaneous speech was dysprosodic and laborious. It was contaminated with dysarthria and phonological paraphasias. However, language comprehension, repetition and naming abilities were normal. Most remarkably he showed no impairment in writing with his left hand. Over the following months, his difficulties in verbal output showed general amelioration, but the isolated impairment in the domain of articulation characterized by dysprosody, dysarthria, and phonological paraphasia persisted. As for the symptomatology of pure anarthria resulting from precentral gyral lesions, there have been controversies about its pureness. Some argue that the so called pure anarthria always shows some degree of writing disturbances, albeit mild in degree. Others maintain there certainly exists the pure type without any signs of agraphia. In the present case lesions were limited to the central gyrus but spared the lowest opercular portion. The previous reports of pure anarthria that had mild agraphia all had lesions involving the opercular portion.

(2010). We describe a 66-year-old man with previous history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation and hypertension, who was admitted to hospital with reduced general condition. He had experienced dizziness and unstable gait for a year, and had been periodically confused, especially in the previous month. MR imaging showed characteristic punctuate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancements in the pons. Our patient was diagnosed with CLIPPERS and was given corticosteroid treatment, initially methylprednisolone intravenously and then prednisone orally. Other differential diagnoses, such as CNS lymphoma, high-grade glioma, CNS vasculitis, neurosarcoidosis, demyelinating disease, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were ruled out. The patient's condition improved dramatically after corticosteroid treatment. In 2017, the diagnostic criteria for CLIPPERS were published. Based on these criteria we were able to diagnose this patient with possible CLIPPERS, consistent with clinical symptoms, MRI findings, absence of better explanations for the condition, and clinical and radiological improvement after treatment with corticosteroids. An unequivocal diagnosis of CLIPPERS can only be established by characteristic pathological findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",10.4045/tidsskr.19.0198,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Norway,nor

University hospital. Patient A 74-year-old woman hospitalized with complaints of progressive dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait disturbance 3 months after the initiation of metronidazole therapy. Intervention Brain magnetic resonance imaging and discontinuation of metronidazole therapy. Main Outcome Measure We observed changes of multiple lesions found on magnetic resonance imaging and analyzed apparent diffusion coefficient map values. Initial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain magnetic resonance images showed high signal intensities in diffuse subcortical white matter, anterior commissure, splenium, basal ganglia, midbrain, cerebellar white matter, and bilateral inferior olivary nuclei. These lesions were resolved after discontinuation of metronidazole therapy. However, the lesions in the inferior olivary nuclei were not resolved; rather they became hypertrophic. Apparent diffusion coefficient map values in the symptom period decreased and were normalized after discontinuation of metronidazole therapy. We describe a patient with metronidazole-induced encephalopathy involving reversible lesions in the anterior commissure, basal ganglia, and cerebellar white matter, which have not been reported previously. We observed inferior olivary hypertrophy, believed to be the result of lesions in the midbrain and cerebellar white matter rather than the result of lesions induced by metronidazole therapy.

This condition is a well-recognized cause of cerebral ischemic stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. Isolated cranial nerve neuropathy is a rare presentation. More common manifestations include incomplete hemiparesis, hemicrania, Horner syndrome, cervical bruit, pulsatile tinnitus, and multiple cranial nerve palsies. A comprehensive literature search (Ovid, MEDLINE) for the presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcome of patients with internal carotid artery dissection was performed. A 43-year-old man presented with a 3-week history of mild dysarthria. There was no history of craniocervical trauma. The physical examination revealed an isolated left hypoglossal nerve paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography findings were consistent with a left skull base ICAD. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. The current rate of cranial nerve involvement is estimated at 10% of all ICADs. This is the second report of isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy without hemicrania in a case of atraumatic ICAD. Patients with an ICAD infrequently present to the otolaryngologist because of its head and neck manifestations. It is crucial to recognize atypical findings and to perform an accurate and prompt diagnostic evaluation.

The majority of these patients show hepatic encephalopathy or chronic acquired (non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD). They characteristically present with dysarthria, ataxia, involuntary movements, and altered mental status. Neuroradiological examination in patients with hepatic encephalopathy often shows abnormal signals in multiple regions of the brain, such as the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, hemispheric white matter, and ventral midbrain. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and CAHD is poorly understood and the response to conventional therapies is often poor. We report a male patient with cirrhosis of unknown cause, who developed slowly progressive cerebellar truncal and limb ataxia and slurred speech. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed focal T2 hyperintensity in bilateral dentate nuclei and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCPs). After treatment by obliteration of the portosystemic shunt, clinical manifestations and MRI abnormalities were dramatically improved. He was followed for six years until he died of uncontrollable bleeding due to hepatocellular carcinoma. At the last examination 9 months before death, he showed no apparent aggravation of neurological symptoms, and no abnormal signal intensities in the MCPs and supratentorial compartment. The clinical course and changes of brain MRI findings of this case are extremely rare, suggesting that obliteration of the portosystemic shunt may be effective for CAHD over long term.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2014.07.068,,Cerebellar ataxia; Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration; Liver disease; MRI; Neuroradiology; Portosystemic shunt,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

One strategy to minimize the impact of these impairments is to use a speech recognition system. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of mild dysarthria and mild cognitive-communication deficits secondary to TBI on a 19-year-old survivor's mastery and use of such a system-specifically, Dragon Naturally Speaking. Data included the % of the participant's words accurately perceived by the system over time, the participant's accuracy over time in using commands for navigation and error correction, and quantitative and qualitative changes in the participant's written texts generated with and without the use of the speech recognition system. Results showed that Dragon NaturallySpeaking was approximately 80% accurate in perceiving words spoken by the participant, and the participant quickly and easily mastered all navigation and error correction commands presented. Quantitatively, the participant produced a greater amount of text using traditional word processing and a standard keyboard than using the speech recognition system. Minimal qualitative differences appeared between writing samples. Discussion of factors that may have contributed to the obtained results and that may affect the generalization of the findings to other TBI survivors is provided.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050050191959,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA) revealed cortical and subcortical infarctions as well as vasculitic occlusion and stenosis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and later with cyclophosphamide. More than 2 years after the onset of neurological disease, two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed the presence of anti-VZV IgG antibody with reduced serum-to-CSF ratios of anti-VZV IgG compared with ratios for total IgG and albumin, indicative of intrathecal synthesis of anti-VZV IgG. After definitive diagnosis, immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued and he was treated with intravenous acyclovir; both mental status and gait improved and no further episodes of neurological dysfunction ensued. The favorable outcome in this patient indicates that VZV vasculopathy can be treated successfully even after 26 months. VZV must be considered as a possible cause of neurological disease in any patient with idiopathic multifocal vasculopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2012.07.059,PMC3483445,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Netherlands,eng

The main outcome measures included clinical and neuroimaging data at three different time points (at the onset of symptoms, after 6 weeks and after 6 months). At 6 weeks, increased activations in the right and left frontal operculum were found and were followed by a trend towards normalization of the activation pattern at 6 months.
