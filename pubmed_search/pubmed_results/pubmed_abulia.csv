7035626,Neoplastic angioendotheliosis.,"Beal, M F; Fisher, C M",Beal,"We add two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliosis to the previous 13 with central nervous system manifestations. This unusual neoplastic phenomenon is thought to represent a diffuse malignant proliferation of endothelial cells. A man aged 58 first had transient ischemic attacks followed by a subacute profound dementia with psychomotor retardation. Remission followed steroid therapy. Abulia recurred along with a gradually progressive paraplegia leading to death 16 months after onset of symptoms. Pathologic examination showed tumor masses in the basal ganglia and widespread patchy cerebral infarction. The spinal cord below the midthoracic level was destroyed. Microscopically small mononuclear tumor cells were widespread within and largely confined to the lumens of small cerebral blood vessels which showed varying degrees of occlusion and recanalization. Factor 8 antigen, a specific endothelial cell marker, was not present on the surface of the malignant cells. Another man aged 61 developed subacute dementia with frontal lobe signs, dysphasia and impairment of memory. Computerized tomography showed multiple infarcts. A brief respite followed steroid therapy but progressive deterioration led to death in 15 weeks. Frontal lobe biopsy revealed the same neoplastic vascular process. The hallmark of the illness is a progressive subacute lobar dementia. Transient spells may occur. Hemiparesis is unusual and seizures do not occur except terminally.

25379445,The circuitry of abulia: insights from functional connectivity MRI.,"Siegel, J S; Snyder, A Z; Metcalf, N V; Fucetola, R P; Hacker, C D; Shimony, J S; Shulman, G L; Corbetta, M",Siegel,"Functional imaging and lesion studies have associated willed behavior with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Abulia is a syndrome characterized by apathy and deficiency of motivated behavior. Abulia is most frequently associated with ACC damage, but also occurs following damage to subcortical nuclei (striatum, globus pallidus, thalamic nuclei). We present resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data from an individual who suffered a stroke leading to abulia. We hypothesized that, although structural imaging revealed no damage to the patient's ACC, fcMRI would uncover aberrant function in this region and in the relevant cortical networks. Resting state correlations in the patient's gray matter were compared to those of age-matched controls. Using a novel method to identify abnormal patterns of functional connectivity in single subjects, we identified areas and networks with aberrant connectivity. Networks associated with memory (default mode network) and executive function (cingulo-opercular network) were abnormal. The patient's anterior cingulate was among the areas showing aberrant functional connectivity. In a rescan 3 years later, deficits remained stable and fcMRI findings were replicated. These findings suggest that the aberrant functional connectivity mapping approach described may be useful for linking stroke symptoms to disrupted network connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,NeuroImage.

It presents with a challenging array of overlapping symptoms, making effective identification and treatment difficult. We describe the first known report of an adolescent with a ventricular assist device who developed abulia following a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke who responded successfully to treatment with olanzapine. The neurobiological etiology of abulia is still unclear but is postulated to be related to deficits in the dopaminergic reward circuitry in the frontal-subcortical-mesolimbic regions. There have been reports of poststroke patients with abulia being treated by modulating this dopamine circuitry and in some cases with short-term low-dose olanzapine. Further research is needed to develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology of abulia leading to more effective treatment algorithms including more specific diagnostic tools and effective pharmacological interventions.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/WNF.0000000000000389,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

8441373,Elements of cognitive rehabilitation after right hemisphere stroke.,"Calvanio, R; Levine, D; Petrone, P",Calvanio,"There are two basic approaches to cognitive training: (1) impairment training and (2) task specific training. Impairment training addresses impairments common to a number of tasks and attempts to offer a general benefit to all of the tasks at once. Task specific training focuses on the impairments that arise in a single task and attempts to improve performance on that task. Impairment training of spatial disorders following right hemisphere stroke has shown some success when curricula are properly designed. The success, however, is quite limited because of normal cognitive constraints and those occurring after brain damage. Task specific training in conjunction with the combined application of various cognitive principles appears more promising, but as yet, only a few studies exist. The neurologic factors are likely to be the same factors that influence recovery. The factors that influence trainability are lesion topography (size and location of the focus plus premorbid atrophy), lesion chronicity, and the presence of additional cognitive impairments (anosognosia, confusion, and abulia). Other interventions that may be beneficial, even for training resistant patients, include behavior modification, cognitive prostheses, and drugs.",{},,Neurologic clinics,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
35004070,Delayed Toxic-Hypoxic Leukoencephalopathy As Sequela of Opioid Overdose and Cerebral Hypoxia-Ischemia.,"Chachkhiani, David; Chimakurthy, Anil K; Verdecie, Olinda; Goyne, Cheryl T; Mader, Edward C",Chachkhiani,"Delayed leukoencephalopathy in the aftermath of toxic exposure and cerebral hypoxia-ischemia is known as ""delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy"" (DPHL) but the name ""delayed toxic-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy"" (DTHL) may be more accurate if toxic and hypoxic mechanisms are both involved in the pathogenesis of delayed leukoencephalopathy. DTHL is characterized by initial recovery from toxic exposure and cerebral hypoxia-ischemia, clinical stability over a few weeks, and subsequent neurological deterioration with the sudden emergence of diffuse white matter disease. A 46-year-old man suffered respiratory failure and hypotension as a result of opioid overdose. Brain MRI showed watershed infarcts and EEG showed diffuse theta-delta slowing consistent with global cerebral hypoperfusion. He recovered fully and was discharged with intact cognitive function. Three weeks later, he presented with abulia and psychomotor retardation. MRI revealed extensive white matter hyperintensity and EEG showed diffuse polymorphic delta activity. DTHL was diagnosed based on classic MRI features, history of opioid overdose and hypoxic brain injury, and negative test results for etiology of white matter disease. He developed akinetic mutism prompting administration of methylprednisolone 1000-mg IV q24h for five days. He also received amantadine 100-mg PO q12h. His cognition, motivation, and psychomotor function slowly improved and returned to baseline about two months after the overdose. Clinic reassessment two and a half months after the overdose revealed normal cognitive function, slight residual MRI hyperintensity, and mild EEG slowing anteriorly.

Four case studies are presented describing the successful treatment of abulia at a lesser severity than akinetic mutism with bromocriptine. Abulia was caused by brain damage due to alcohol in two cases, Wilson's disease and basal ganglia infarct in one each. Maximum bromocriptine dose varied from 25-70 mg. All improved considerably. Withdrawal or reduction of medication in three produced deterioration. The prescription of a neuroleptic drug had a similar effect in the fourth. One patient with a previous history developed a depressive relapse and so the drug was withdrawn and lisuride introduced. This produced a similar improvement.

This case report aims to give a pictorial description of a case in which a patient with asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy presented with the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and complex rituals of cleanliness. We report on the case of a 68-year-old, right-handed White woman with complex rituals and progressive speech impairment. The obsessive-compulsive rituals represented an exacerbation of lifelong preoccupations with cleanliness and orderliness that were praised by her relatives. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a striking impairment of language and memory, with relative sparing of tool-use praxis and visuospatial skills. Magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>18</sup>fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans showed bilateral asymmetrical temporal lobe atrophy and hypometabolism.

This syndrome is characterized by apathy and abulia with preserved alertness; it is caused by fluid retention within the cranial cavity. The syndrome may also develop in patients with other conditions that cause anasarca, e.g., severe liver or kidney disease or hypoalbuminemia. Because patients with these conditions are often quite ill, it has been difficult to verify the pathophysiologic aspects of the syndrome so that its mechanism must remain a hypothesis that awaits more definitive study in a series of patients.

The lesions involved bilaterally the globus pallidus, the striatum or the frontal lobe. Recently, anatomical findings have shown several circuits through the basal ganglia additional to the motor circuit. The caudate nucleus receives inputs from the prefrontal and limbic cortex. These inputs are transmitted to the globus pallidus, then to the thalamus and ultimately return to the dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas. Lesions in any part of these cortico-subcortical loops may be responsible for a dramatic behavioral syndrome, emphasizing their functional specificity in drive.

A 53-year-old woman, generally in good health and active, had no contributory medical history except for hypertension. She was well until August 20, 1988, when she was noted to have become taciturn and absent-minded. In the morning, she got up and went to work as usual. Although she worked without trouble, she hardly talked with her colleagues. After getting home from work, she would lie down without doing any housework, and this was continued on the following day. However, she had no physical problems. She was thus admitted to a hospital on August 22. Lethargy and urinary incontinence were apparent for a few days. Thereafter she became awakeful and could take care of herself. She sat on her bed all the time, and could talk normally with her daughter. She was referred subsequently to the Department of Neurology, Hyogo Prefectural Tsukaguchi Hospital on August 30. On examination, the patient was alert, polite and cooperative with no physical abnormalities except for high blood pressure. Neurological examination indicated the patient to be attentive and well-oriented. Cranial nerves and eye movements were normal except for slight anisocoria and sluggish pupils. There were no muscle weakness, extrapyramidal signs, or cerebellar signs. Deep tendon reflexes were normal. Babinski signs and forced grasping were not noted.

This appears to have been precipitated by heavy psychedelic substance use, including cannabis, salvia divinorum, ketamine, LSD, cocaine and DMT amongst others. The psychosis remained in the absence of drug intoxication and was associated with prominent apathy, lack of concern and abulia. This study discusses the heavy psychedelic substance misuse possibly potentiating a transition to psychosis in this individual. Little work has been undertaken in this area as substance misuse has traditionally been an exclusion criteria for investigating psychosis in this patient group. It is suggested that psychedelic substance misuse should be investigated as a risk factor for psychotic illness in patients with brain injury, as this case clearly suggests.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1046491,,Drug-use; neuropsychiatry; psychosis; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Little is known about the mechanisms by which the virus causes central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, and therefore little guidance is available regarding potential workup or management options. We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria. Further research is needed to determine if delirium in COVID-19 represents a primary encephalopathy heralding invasion of the CNS by the virus, or a secondary encephalopathy related to systemic inflammatory response or other factors.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,General hospital psychiatry,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.05.008,PMC7242189,Akinetic mutism; COVID-19; Delirium; Encephalopathy; SARS-CoV-2,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Abulia is felt to be related to dysfunction with the brain's dopamine-dependent circuitry. The role of default mode network (DMN) in its pathogenesis is crucial. In this case report, we detail the presentation of abulia in an elderly woman following surgical resection of a right frontal glioblastoma involving the DMN. Connectomic imaging was used pre-operatively and post-operatively, demonstrating disruption of regions integral to the DMN and the central executive network. We observed a significant cognitive improvement following the administration of levodopa and carbidopa. Preoperative assessment of both anatomical and functional networks can help ensure surgical safety and predict postoperative deficits. This evaluation not only enhances preparedness and facilitates early case diagnosis but also expedites the initiation of prompt and potentially targeted treatments.

However, current technological advances using antibodies can enable a definitive diagnosis in cases that would previously have been suspected to be idiopathic or viral encephalitis. Our objective is to show that tonsil neuroendocrine carcinoma can present initially as limbic encephalitis mediated by N-type calcium channel antibodies and to highlight the diagnostic confusion before cancer detection. We report a rare case of neuroendocrine cancer presenting as limbic encephalopathy, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and neuropathy. The patient was diagnosed and treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in November 2011. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis was diagnosed based on clinical presentation of seizures, short-term memory loss, retrograde amnesia, disorientation, distractibility, and abulia; on the exclusion of brain metastases, CNS infection, stroke, metabolic or nutritional deficits, or medication-related events; and on CSF results with inflammatory findings and an abnormal electroencephalography study that showed seizure activity in the left temporal lobe. Serum paraneoplastic panel was positive for P/Q-type calcium channel antibody and N-type calcium channel antibody. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was unremarkable. This case highlights limbic encephalitis as an atypical presentation of neuroendocrine cancer. It also illustrates how treatment of the underlying cancer can reverse limbic encephalitis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in a neuroendocrine carcinoma patient even before the paraneoplastic panel becomes negative.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2014.01.004,,Calcium channel antibodies; Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome; Limbic encephalitis; Neuroendocrine cancer; Paraneoplastic syndrome; Small-cell lung cancer,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

A 123I-IMP single photon emission CT disclosed remarkable hypoperfusion in the bilateral frontal cortex. After a week of somnolence, he gradually became wakeful, but was still abulic. Neuropsychological examinations revealed no memory disturbance. We consider that disconnection of the thalamo-frontal projection at the genua of the internal capsules caused somnolence, apathy, and abulia in our case. The hitherto reported cases of the genu infarcts that showed memory disturbance had the lesion involving both the inferior thalamic peduncle and its nearby mamillothalamic tract.

Susac, Susac syndrome (SuS) or SICRET (small infarctions of cochlear, retinal and encephalic tissue) has persisted as an elusive entity. To date the available evidence for its treatment is based on case reports and case series. The largest systematic review described only 304 reported cases since the 1970s. Here we presented the first reported case to our knowledge in Mexican population and the unusual presentation in a pregnant patient. A 34-year-old Hispanic woman was brought to the ER in our hospital for apathy and behavioral changes. Upon arrival at the ER, her husband described a one-month history of behavioral changes with apathy, progressive abulia, visuospatial disorientation, and gait deterioration. The initial lab test shows no significance except by a positive qualitative hCG. An MRI was obtained and showed hyperintense periventricular white matter lesions in T2 and FLAIR sequences also involving bilateral basal ganglia and with predominant affection of the corpus callosum, in addition to infratentorial cerebellar lesions. After treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins a marked and prompt clinical and radiological improvement was observed. SuS is still an elusive disease. To date, no definitive score or clinical feature can predict the outcome of the disease. The presentation during pregnancy is also rare and therefore the optimal treatment and the prognosis is unknown. We hope that this article will serve as a foundation for future research.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,eNeurologicalSci,10.1016/j.ensci.2017.12.004,PMC5933996,Corpus callosum; Demyelinating disease; Neuroinflammation; Susac syndrome; Vasculitis,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng
23909660,Effects of video modelling on emerging speech in an adult with traumatic brain injury: preliminary findings.,"Nikopoulos, Christos K; Nikopoulou-Smyrni, Panagiota; Konstantopoulos, Kostas",Nikopoulos,"Research has shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) can affect a person's ability to perform previously learned skills. Dysexecutive syndrome and inattention, for example, alongside a number of other cognitive and behavioural impairments such as memory loss and lack of motivation, significantly affect day-to-day functioning following TBI. This study examined the efficacy of video modelling in emerging speech in an adult male with TBI caused by an assault. In an effort to identify functional relations between this novice intervention and the target behaviour, experimental control was achieved by using within-system research methodology, overcoming difficulties of forming groups for such an highly non-homogeneous population. Across a number of conditions, the participant watched a videotape in which another adult modelled a selection of 19 spoken words. When this modelled behaviour was performed in vivo, then generalization across 76 other words in the absence of a videotape took place. It was revealed that video modelling can promote the performance of previously learned behaviours related to speech, but more significantly it can facilitate the generalization of this verbal behaviour across untrained words. Video modelling could well be added within the rehabilitation programmes for this population.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.809550,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

16210227,Basal ganglia lesions and the theory of fronto-subcortical loops: neuropsychological findings in two patients with left caudate lesions.,"Benke, Thomas; Delazer, Margarete; Bartha, Lisa; Auer, Alexandra",Benke,"Basal ganglia lesions have a high prevalence for associated behavioural impairments. However, the exact pattern of cognitive impairments and its relationship to individual basal ganglia lesion have rarely been investigated by means of a detailed neuropsychological and lesion study. Furthermore, different mechanisms have been proposed as relevant for the observed cognitive deficits; among these, the hypothesis of fronto-subcortical loops (Alexander et al., 1986) has made predictions regarding the relationship between the damage of particular striato-frontal circuits and the resulting behavioural impairment which await clinical confirmation. We present a study of two subjects who suffered a MRI-documented focal left basal ganglia hematoma. The two patients differed in their lesions; in one patient (PJ) large parts of the caudate nucleus were destroyed whereas in the other (AS) mainly the pallidum and putamen were lesioned and the caudate suffered only minor damage. In the acute phase, the behavioural and neuropsychological abnormalities were similar in both cases and included mainly abulia, an impairment of executive and attentional functions, and a severe amnestic syndrome. After several months many functions were restored in AS, whereas PJ's abilities remained largely defective. Based on these data and on previous case studies several conclusions are drawn. Left caudate lesions induce marked and long-lasting behavioural and neuropsychological impairments comprising predominantly drive, executive control, attention, and memory. The extent of lesion in the head of the caudate nucleus is the critical factor regarding the severity and the outcome of the syndrome, whereas damage to the putamen and pallidum is less crucial for cognitive functions. A subset of behavioural alterations, among them abulia, attentional and frontal-executive dysfunctions, can well be attributed to lesions of the anterior cingulate circuit and the dorsolateral-frontal circuit at the basal ganglia level. Other impairments, most importantly the prominent amnestic syndrome, are more difficult to interpret on the grounds of this hypothesis and may be related to other pathomechanisms.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.1.70.14374,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

His hip was blocked and extremely painful. He was totally dependent for daily-life activities (Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score = 18). Moreover he exhibited severe cognitive and behavioural troubles, which had been stable for many months beforehand, e.g. complete disorientation for time and place, major memory disorders, agitation, anxiety, depression, irritability, disinhibition, aggressiveness and lack of initiative. Pain disappeared within a few weeks after treatment. Progressively, functional improvement occurred (sitting position, transfers, walking between parallel bars). The FIM score increased to 63. Aggressiveness, irritability and agitation disappeared. Surprisingly, neuropsychological assessment demonstrated parallel improvement of cognitive functions, especially in regard to orientation, and to a lesser degree attention and memory.

Neuropsychological testing in five patients with left-sided infarcts revealed severe verbal memory loss. Additional cognitive deficits consistent with dementia occurred in four patients. A right-sided infarct caused transient impairment in visuospatial memory. Functional brain imaging in three patients showed a focal reduction in hemispheric perfusion most prominent in the ipsilateral inferior and medial frontal cortex. We infer that the capsular genu infarct interrupted the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles, resulting in functional deactivation of the ipsilateral frontal cortex.

A 30-year-old patient was the victim of a severe head injury with frontal bruise at the age of 15. At the request of his family, he consulted for a 7-year history that included a lack of initiative and the inability to generate behavior spontaneously, contrasting with the ability to execute behaviors on command. He also presented indifference, major emotional disruption without sadness, pessimism, and other depressive signs. The examination found a severe apathetic syndrome confirmed by specific scales with a mild impairment of executive functions and without depressive syndrome. Encephalic MRI showed atrophy of the whole prefrontal cerebral cortex.

Apathy occurs frequently after traumatic brain injury, in 23-71% of patients according to the authors. The pathophysiology of apathy has been described in anatomical terms as related to disruption of frontal-subcortical pathways. The biochemical hypothesis postulates a disruption in dopaminergic activity. The use of dopaminergic agents usually improves cases similar to our patient. Apathy is frequent following head injury, warranting a search for systematic causes.
