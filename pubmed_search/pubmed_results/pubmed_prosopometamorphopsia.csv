This case report describes a right-handed patient who complained of prosopometamorphopsia associated with the lower part of the face and alexia following infarction of the left splenium in the corpus callosum. The splenium and adjacent retrosplenial cortex facilitate the transfer of visual information and memory function between the two hemispheres of the brain and along the Papez circuit, respectively. We believe that damage to this singular area of the brain could bring about several concurrent yet disparate symptoms, such as the reported prosopometamorphopsia and alexia with this patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,eNeurologicalSci,10.1016/j.ensci.2016.08.002,PMC5721556,Alexia; Prosopometamorphopsia; Retrosplenial cortex; Splenium; Transient global amnesia,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

He underwent fibrinolytic treatment. During the following days he progressively recovered and was discharged without neurological focal sign. Patent foramen ovale was found. When he got back to his house he noticed that he was unable to recognize the voice of his favoured singers and needed to ask who was the singer to his relatives. Neuropsychological examination revealed a selective impairment in famous voice recognition in the absence of alteration of voice perception, face perception and famous face recognition. All other neuropsychological domains were spared. In particular language, memory and executive functions were intact. Neuroimaging carried out by means of PET and MRI revealed two small ischemic lesions in the right subcortical region, involving lenticular and caudate nuclei and in the right temporal pole. To our knowledge, this is the first case described in literature of a patient showing a selective associative phonagnosia after right anterior temporal stroke. The present case helps to clarify the brain circuits underlying famous voice recognition and adds evidence in favour of a right hemisphere involvement in processing knowledge of familiar voices. These findings are discussed in relation to current models of brain organization of person-specific and general semantic knowledge.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.05.016,,Associative phonagnosia; Famous voice recognition; Right temporal pole,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
30670082,The hidden identity of faces: a case of lifelong prosopagnosia.,"Wegrzyn, Martin; Garlichs, Annika; Heß, Richard W K; Woermann, Friedrich G; Labudda, Kirsten",Wegrzyn,"Not being able to recognize a person's face is a highly debilitating condition from which people with developmental prosopagnosia (DP) suffer their entire life. Here we describe the case of J, a 30 year old woman who reports being unable to recognize her parents, her husband, or herself in the mirror. We set out to assess the severity of J's prosopagnosia using tests with unfamiliar as well as familiar faces and investigated whether impaired configural processing explains her deficit. To assess the specificity of the impairment, we tested J's performance when evaluating emotions, intentions, and the attractiveness and likability of faces. Detailed testing revealed typical brain activity patterns for faces and normal object recognition skills, and no evidence of any brain injury. However, compared to a group of matched controls, J showed severe deficits in learning new faces, and in recognizing familiar faces when only inner features were available. Her recognition of uncropped faces with blurred features was within the normal range, indicating preserved configural processing when peripheral features are available. J was also unimpaired when evaluating intentions and emotions in faces. In line with healthy controls, J rated more average faces as more attractive. However, she was the only one to rate them as less likable, indicating a preference for more distinctive and easier to recognize faces. Taken together, the results illustrate both the severity and the specificity of DP in a single case. While DP is a heterogeneous disorder, an inability to integrate the inner features of the face into a whole might be the best explanation for the difficulties many individuals with prosopagnosia experience.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC psychology,10.1186/s40359-019-0278-z,PMC6343346,Configural processing; Developmental prosopagnosia; Face perception; Object recognition; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Every visual representation has a reference frame [1], and the visual system uses a variety of reference frames to efficiently code visual information [e.g., 1-5]. The representation of faces in early stages of visual processing depends on retino-centered reference frames, but little is known about the reference frames that code the high-level representations used to make judgements about faces. Here, we focus on a rare and striking disorder of face perception-hemi-prosopometamorphopsia (hemi-PMO)-to investigate these reference frames. After a left splenium lesion, Patient A.D. perceives features on the right side of faces as if they had melted. The same features were distorted when faces were presented in either visual field, at different in-depth rotations, and at different picture-plane orientations including upside-down. A.D.'s results indicate faces are aligned to a view- and orientation-independent face template encoded in a face-centered reference frame, that these face-centered representations are present in both the left and right hemisphere, and that the representations of the left and right halves of a face are dissociable.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Current biology : CB,10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.067,,face processing; hemi-prosopometamorphopsia; splenium; view-independent face representation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

31983272,Atypical holistic processing of facial identity and expression in a case of acquired prosopagnosia.,"Monti, Cecilia; Sozzi, Matteo; Bossi, Francesco; Corbo, Massimo; Rivolta, Davide",Monti,"Typical face perception is mediated by holistic processing (i.e., the simultaneous integration of face parts into a whole representation). People with Acquired Prosopagnosia (AP), who have lost the ability to recognise faces after a brain lesion, should thus show atypical holistic coding. Our aim is to use the composite-face effect (CFE) as a measure of holistic processing in ST, a 48-year-old woman with AP but normal recognition of facial expressions of emotions, and matched healthy control participants. Two experiments examining the CFE for identity (Experiment 1) and for expression of emotions (Experiment 2) were conducted. Contrary to controls, in both experiments, ST showed an atypical (i.e., reversed) CFE, thus suggesting altered holistic mechanisms affecting both components of perceptual judgement. Results also suggest that normal facial expression recognition is achievable even with holistic processing difficulties, possibly through compensatory, part-based, mechanisms.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643294.2020.1718071,,Face; emotions; expression; holistic; identity; prosopagnosia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

22389107,"Facial dysmorphopsia: a notable variant of the ""thin man"" phenomenon?","Ganssauge, Martin; Papageorgiou, Eleni; Schiefer, Ulrich",Ganssauge,"The aim of this work is to investigate the facial distortion (dysmorphopsia) experienced by patients with homonymous paracentral scotomas and to analyze the interrelationship with the previously described ""thin man"" phenomenon. Routine neuro-ophthalmological examination and brain MRI in three patients who suffered from small homonymous paracentral scotomas due to infarction or arteriovenous malformations of the occipital lobe. They all complained of distortion and shrinkage of their interlocutor's face contralateral to the brain lesion. The phenomenon appeared some seconds after steady fixation on the interlocutor's nose and was evident with both left and right homonymous scotomas. The patients did not notice a gap in the area corresponding to the scotoma and objects other than faces were perceived normally. Homonymous paracentral scotomas can lead to focal displacement of facial features towards the center of the field defect with resulting distortion of the face on the affected side. This so-called ""dysmorphopsia"" makes faces appear regionally narrower than they are in reality and may be induced even by visual field defects that remain undetected by conventional perimetry using 6° × 6° grids. Predilection for faces is probably associated with the superior location of scotomas or specific impairment of face processing abilities related to the lesion site. Facial dysmorphopsia is most probably associated with cortical ""filling-in"" and spatial distortion, and can hence be regarded as a special entity of the ""thin man"" phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,10.1007/s00417-012-1958-z,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
19334315,The role of Funktionswandel in metamorphopsia.,"Nijboer, Tanja C W; Ruis, Carla; van der Worp, H Bart; De Haan, Edward H F",Nijboer,"Patients with metamorphopsia perceive objects or faces as being distorted and/or different in size. In most cases, recognition is not impaired. The stimulus specificity, particularly in the case of face perception, has led to the suggestion that metamorphopsia is a deficit at the entry level of category-specific recognition systems; in this case, the face processing system. An explanation in terms of a visuosensory deficit (i.e., Funktionswandel) that affects the perception of specific stimulus categories has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we report two patients (MZ and CM) who experienced hemi-metamorphopsia for faces after a stroke in the posterior part of the brain. Despite the distortions, they could still match and recognize faces. We carried out a detailed evaluation of their visual-sensory status and found that both MZ and CM had specific problems with discriminating and estimating sizes and shapes, especially in the contralesional visual field. It was concluded that these cases, metamorphopsia was not due to a higher-order perception impairment specific for faces, but rather of a specific impairment in shape perception in the contralesional visual field that proportionally affects the perception of faces.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x256563,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
35855186,Prosopagnosia following nonlanguage dominant inferior temporal lobe low-grade glioma resection in which the inferior longitudinal fasciculus was disrupted preoperatively: illustrative case.,"Young, Jacob S; Morshed, Ramin A; Andrews, John P; Cha, Soonmee; Berger, Mitchel S",Young,"Prosopagnosia is a rare neurological condition characterized by the impairment of face perception with preserved visual processing and cognitive functioning and is associated with injury to the fusiform gyrus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). Reports of this clinical impairment following resection of right temporal lobe diffuse gliomas in the absence of contralateral injury are exceedingly scarce and not expected as a complication of surgery. The authors describe the case of a young female patient found to have an incidental diffuse glioma in the right inferior temporal lobe despite evidence of preoperative ILF disruption by the tumor. Following resection of the lesion, despite the preoperative disruption to the ILF by the tumor, the patient developed prosopagnosia. There was no evidence of contralateral, left-sided ILF injury. Given the significant functional impairment associated with prosopagnosia, neurosurgeons should be aware of the exceedingly rare possibility of a visual-processing deficit following unilateral and, in this case, right-sided inferior temporal lobe glioma resections. More investigation is needed to determine whether preoperative testing can determine dominance of facial-processing networks for patients with lesions in the right inferior posterior temporooccipital lobe and whether intraoperative mapping could help prevent this complication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of neurosurgery.

21802435,Impairment of holistic face perception following right occipito-temporal damage in prosopagnosia: converging evidence from gaze-contingency.,"Van Belle, Goedele; Busigny, Thomas; Lefèvre, Philippe; Joubert, Sven; Felician, Olivier; Gentile, Francesco; Rossion, Bruno",Van Belle,"Gaze-contingency is a method traditionally used to investigate the perceptual span in reading by selectively revealing/masking a portion of the visual field in real time. Introducing this approach in face perception research showed that the performance pattern of a brain-damaged patient with acquired prosopagnosia (PS) in a face matching task was reversed, as compared to normal observers: the patient showed almost no further decrease of performance when only one facial part (eye, mouth, nose, etc.) was available at a time (foveal window condition, forcing part-based analysis), but a very large impairment when the fixated part was selectively masked (mask condition, promoting holistic perception) (Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Busigny, & Rossion, 2010a; Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Rossion, & Lefèvre, 2010b). Here we tested the same manipulation in a recently reported case of pure prosopagnosia (GG) with unilateral right hemisphere damage (Busigny, Joubert, Felician, Ceccaldi, & Rossion, 2010). Contrary to normal observers, GG was also significantly more impaired with a mask than with a window, demonstrating impairment with holistic face perception. Together with our previous study, these observations support a generalized account of acquired prosopagnosia as a critical impairment of holistic (individual) face perception, implying that this function is a key element of normal human face recognition. Furthermore, the similar behavioral pattern of the two patients despite different lesion localizations supports a distributed network view of the neural face processing structures, suggesting that the key function of human face processing, namely holistic perception of individual faces, requires the activity of several brain areas of the right hemisphere and their mutual connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.010,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Performance improved beyond the chance-level observed prestimulation, and relied on reversing the electrode polarity across two separate blocks of trials, such that each mastoid received positive current for one block and then negative charge for the next. Although our study involved only a single case, the data provide preliminary evidence that a deficit in perceptual face matching can be reduced by GVS.

At first sight, these delusions would seem to have little to do with each other, except that they both involve bizarre claims about existence (for self or others). On closer examination, however, there are other parallels. Here, we summarise similarities in associated impairments of face perception, and argue that both delusions reflect an interaction of impairments at two levels. One set of contributory factors involves perceptual impairment, or anomalous perceptual experience. The other factors lead to an incorrect interpretation of this, for which we offer an explanation in terms of attribution theory. Although the Capgras and Cotard delusions are phenomenally distinct, they may therefore represent attempts to make sense of fundamentally similar experiences.",{},,Psychopathology,10.1159/000284874,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Initial neuropsychological and eye-movement investigations indicated that EM had profound difficulties in face perception as well as face recognition. EM underwent 14 weeks of perceptual training in an online programme that attempted to improve her ability to make fine-grained discriminations between faces. Following training, EM's face perception skills had improved, and the effect generalised to untrained faces. Eye-movement analyses also indicated that EM spent more time viewing the inner facial features post-training. Examination of EM's face recognition skills revealed an improvement in her recognition of personally-known faces when presented in a laboratory-based test, although the same gains were not noted in her everyday experiences with these faces. In addition, EM did not improve on a test assessing the recognition of newly encoded faces. One month after training, EM had maintained the improvement on the eye-tracking test, and to a lesser extent, her performance on the familiar faces test. This pattern of findings is interpreted as promising evidence that the programme can improve face perception skills, and with some adjustments, may at least partially improve face recognition skills.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2014.973886,,Encephalitis; Face recognition; Prosopagnosia; Rehabilitation; Training,Case Reports; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,England,eng

The patients reported so far have posterior lesions encompassing either or both the right inferior occipital cortex and fusiform gyrus, and exhibit a critical impairment in generating a sufficiently detailed holistic percept to individualize faces. Here, we extended these observations to include the prosopagnosic patient LR (Bukach, Bub, Gauthier, & Tarr, 2006), whose damage is restricted to the anterior region of the right temporal lobe. First, we report that LR is able to discriminate parametrically defined individual exemplars of nonface object categories as accurately and quickly as typical observers, which suggests that the visual similarity account of prosopagnosia does not explain his impairments. Then, we show that LR does not present with the typical face inversion effect, whole-part advantage, or composite face effect and, therefore, has impaired holistic perception of individual faces. Moreover, the patient is more impaired at matching faces when the facial part he fixates is masked than when it is selectively revealed by means of gaze contingency. Altogether these observations support the view that the nature of the critical face impairment does not differ qualitatively across patients with acquired prosopagnosia, regardless of the localization of brain damage: all these patients appear to be impaired to some extent at what constitutes the heart of our visual expertise with faces, namely holistic perception at a sufficiently fine-grained level of resolution to discriminate exemplars of the face class efficiently. This conclusion raises issues regarding the existing criteria for diagnosis/classification of patients as cases of apperceptive or associative prosopagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.01.018,,Acquired prosopagnosia; Anterior temporal lobe; Face perception; Holistic perception; Right hemisphere,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Here we report the third long-lasting case of autoscopy in a patient with right occipital lesion. Instead of the commonly reported frontal mirror view (fantôme spéculaire), the patient saw her head and upper trunk laterally in side view (fantôme de profil). We found that the visual appearance and completeness of the autoscopic image could be selectively modulated by active and passive movements, without being influenced by imagining the same movements or by tactile and auditory stimulation. Eyes closure did not disrupt either the perception of the autoscopic body or the effects of the motor stimulation. Moreover, the visual body reduplication was coded neither in purely eye-centered nor in head-centered frames of reference, suggesting the involvement of egocentric coordinate systems (eyes and head centered). A follow-up examination highlighted the stability of the visual characteristics of the body reduplication and its shift induced by displacement of both head and eyes. These findings support the view that autoscopic phenomena have a multisensory motor origin and proprioceptive signals may play an important role in modulating the illusory visual reduplication of the patient's own body, most likely via cross-modal modulation of extrastriate areas involved in body and face perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21569,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
