34664637,"Seen by a Glance, But Not by a Stare-A Case Study of a Patient With Simultanagnosia.","Morihara, Keisuke; Higashiyama, Yuichi; Asano, Shiori; Matsunaga, Yuki; Takahashi, Keita; Miyake, Ryoko; Tanaka, Kenichi; Joki, Hideto; Doi, Hiroshi; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Tanaka, Fumiaki",Morihara,"Simultanagnosia is a rare neuropsychological symptom characterized by difficulty recognizing global structures while preserving perception of local detail. The condition is classified into ventral and dorsal types. Clinical presentation of ventral simultanagnosia includes a reduced ability to recognize multiple visual stimuli rapidly, that is, part-by-part recognition. Here, we report a case of ventral simultanagnosia with a unique presentation; when short-duration visual stimuli were presented, the patient could perform global recognition by improving his part-by-part approach. To investigate the relationship between local and global perception bias and the duration of the present stimulus, we conducted a visual perception test using hierarchically organized Navon figures. The patient was a 62-year-old right-handed man who suffered from cerebral infarction in the right occipitotemporal lobe. He had no language dysfunction but exhibited left unilateral neglect, prosopagnosia, and ventral-type simultanagnosia. We conducted a visual perception test using the Navon figures and control figures as a visual stimulus. We randomly presented the figures for intervals of 0.2 or 20 s and let the patient report all the letters (global and/or local element) that he recognized. Global elements of the Navon letter were recognized a rate of 0% and 78.3% at intervals of 20 and 0.2 s, respectively, indicating that shorter presentation made the part-by-part approach less likely to manifest. We assumed that the simultanagnosia in this case was caused by failure to maintain the initially perceived global information for a long period of time during visual presentation, due to right occipitotemporal damage.",{},,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,10.1093/arclin/acab088,,Case report; Hierarchical letter; Navon letter; Presentation time; Simultanagnosia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
6244876,Word-form dyslexia.,"Warrington, E K; Shallice, T",Warrington,"In this study we have reported our investigation of two patients with an acquired dyslexia characterized by letter-by-letter reading, whole word reading being apparently impossible. It has been shown that this phenomenon of letter-by-letter reading cannot be accounted for by visual or perceptual factors nor by impairment of visual span of apprehension. The exceptionally slow speed of reading was documented and a clear relationship between word length and reading speed established. Performance on tasks considered to maximize whole word reading which at the same time prevent the possibility of letter-by-letter reading, namely, reading script and reading with tachistoscopic presentation, was impaired. The satisfactory performance of these two patients on tasks of picture interpretation suggests that the two components of the syndrome simultanagnosia, letter-by-letter reading and piecemeal perception of complex scenes, are dissociable. Three alternative explanations of letter-by-letter reading are considered and we conclude that in this type of acquired dyslexia there is damage to the system through which a visual word-form is attained.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.1.99,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
16909634,Dorsal simultanagnosia: An impairment of visual processing or visual awareness?,"Jackson, Georgina M; Shepherd, Tracy; Mueller, Sven C; Husain, Masid; Jackson, Stephen R",Jackson,"When presented with two objects patients with simultanagnosia show a marked impairment at naming both items. This has led many authors to conclude that the second item is not being processed (e.g., Robinson, 2003). However, this deficit may instead reflect a deficit with explicit, or conscious report. We investigated this issue using a semantic priming paradigm that allowed us to assess implicit processing of the second ""unseen"" item. We presented a patient, with bilateral parietal damage, with pairs of pictures that were either from the same or a different semantic category. The patient was asked to either classify one of the pictures or to name both pictures. When the items were from different categories the patient's classification performance was significantly poorer than when they were from the same category, even though he could rarely explicitly report both items. These findings are consistent with the notion that the meaning of the ""unseen"" item influenced the reporting of the ""seen"" item. Consequently, the deficit seen in this patient does not seem to reflect an inability to process more than one item simultaneously but rather a deficit in explicitly identifying multiple items.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70412-x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
19120445,Perception of global gestalt by temporal integration in simultanagnosia.,"Huberle, Elisabeth; Rupek, Paul; Lappe, Markus; Karnath, Hans-Otto",Huberle,"Patients with bilateral parieto-occipital brain damage may show intact processing of individual objects, while their perception of multiple objects is disturbed at the same time. The deficit is termed 'simultanagnosia' and has been discussed in the context of restricted visual working memory and impaired visuo-spatial attention. Recent observations indicated that the recognition of global shapes can be modulated by the spatial distance between individual objects in patients with simultanagnosia and thus is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon depending on spatial continuity. However, grouping mechanisms not only require the spatial integration of visual information, but also involve integration processes over time. The present study investigated motion-defined integration mechanisms in two patients with simultanagnosia. We applied hierarchical organized stimuli of global objects that consisted of coherently moving dots ('shape-from-motion'). In addition, we tested the patients' ability to recognize biological motion by presenting characteristic human movements ('point-light-walker'). The data revealed largely preserved perception of biological motion, while the perception of motion-defined shapes was impaired. Our findings suggest separate mechanisms underlying the recognition of biological motion and shapes defined by coherently moving dots. They thus argue against a restriction in the overall capacity of visual working memory over time as a general explanation for the impaired global shape recognition in patients with simultanagnosia.",{},,The European journal of neuroscience,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06559.x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",France,eng

20170667,Retinal versus physical stimulus size as determinants of visual perception in simultanagnosia.,"Huberle, Elisabeth; Driver, Jon; Karnath, Hans-Otto",Huberle,"Patients with simultanagnosia following bilateral parieto-temporo-occipital brain damage show a characteristic impairment of global gestalt perception, while their perception of individual objects or elements remains intact. For instance, when shown 'hierarchical' stimuli comprising a larger global object (e.g. a large letter) made up from smaller components (e.g. multiple small letters), they typically report seeing one of the smaller components but not the global figure. Recent work on simultanagnosia revealed that global perception can be improved if local element spacing is reduced. However, it is still unclear whether the retinal separation or the physical (post-size-constancy) spatial separation is critical. Here, we presented various hierarchical global/local letter stimuli at different viewing distances and sizes to separate the impacts of retinal versus physical size. Our findings indicate a key role for visual angle in determining simultanagnosic perception. We observed that not only retinal spacing (in terms of visual angle) between local elements had a major impact on global perception in simultanagnosia, but also the physical size of the separation between local elements, provided that binocular cues to viewing distance were available. The results indicate both pre-size-constancy retinal influences and binocular-post-constancy influences upon conscious perception in simultanagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.02.013,PMC2877877,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Clinically, significant deficits were found in reading (alexia) and simultaneous multiobject perception (simultanagnosia), both of which the patient denied limitation in, and in vision-right hemianopsia-which he readily acknowledged. Visual acuity in the left visual field was normal. The patient also demonstrated a symptom of optic ataxia-a lack of coordination between visual inputs and hand movements-a deficit he also acknowledged. Work-up with computed topography revealed a left posterior cerebral artery infarct affecting the occipital lobe and extending to involve the parietal lobe and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The authors describe and discuss this fascinating case-the first case to their knowledge of a double disassociation of anosognosia for alexia and simultanagnosia but full, indeed quantitative, awareness of hemianopsia and optic ataxia. This case may be informative on the mechanism of anosognosia in general and supports intentional feed-forward and exemplar reafference models.

Under most circumstances, however, object identity and location are linked. We report data from a simultanagnosic patient (K.E.) with bilateral posterior parietal infarcts who was unable to ""see"" more than one object in an array despite relatively preserved object processing and normal preattentive processing. K.E. also demonstrated a finding that has not, to our knowledge, been reported: He was unable to report more than one attribute of a single object. For example, he was unable to name the color of the ink in which words were written despite naming the word correctly. Several experiments demonstrated, however, that perceptual attributes that he was unable to report influenced his performance. We suggest that binding of object identity and location is a limited-capacity operation that is essential for conscious awareness for which the posterior parietal lobe is crucial.",{},,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2008.20002,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, this simple dichotomy has been contested, with recent studies suggesting that impairments in perception-for-action and visuo-spatial imagery may reflect a more general deficit in space-based attention. Although previous studies have revealed the impact of brain damage on artistic expression, few have examined the impact on artistic expression in terms of the perceptual and spatial components of either visual processing or visual imagery. Here we present the case of an artist whose artistic expression was dramatically affected following devastating posterior brain damage. Of particular interest, we demonstrate how these changes relate to impairments in integrating and aligning different spatial features in both visual processing and visual imagery, suggestive of a general simultanagnosia not previously described.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.01.023,,Art; Imagery; Simultanagnosia; Spatial processing; Visual perception,Case Reports,Italy,eng
31726066,Three-systems for visual numerosity: A single case study.,"Anobile, G; Tomaiuolo, F; Campana, S; Cicchini, G M",Anobile,"Humans possess the remarkable capacity to assess the numerosity of a set of items over a wide range of conditions, from a handful of items to hundreds of them. Recent evidence is starting to show that judgments over such a large range is possible because of the presence of three mechanisms, each tailored to specific stimulation conditions. Previous evidence in favour of this theory comes from the fact that discrimination thresholds and estimation reaction times are not constants across numerosity levels. Likewise, attention is capable of dissociating the three mechanisms: when healthy adult observers are asked to perform concurrently a taxing task, the judgments of low numerosities (<4 dots) or of high numerosities is affected greatly, not so however for intermediate numerosities. Here we bring evidence from a neuropsychological perspective. To this end we measured perceptual performance in PA, a 41 year-old patient who suffers simultanagnosia after a hypoxic brain injury. PA showed a profound deficit in attentively tracking objects over space and time (multiple object tracking), even in very simple conditions where controls made no errors. PA also showed a massive deficit on sensory thresholds when comparing dot-arrays containing extremely low (3 dots) or extremely high (64, 128 dots) numerosities as well as in comparing dot-distances. Surprisingly, PA discrimination thresholds were relatively spared for intermediate numerosity (12 and 16 dots). Overall his deficit on the numerosity task results in a U-shape function across numerosity which, combined with the attentional deficit and the inability to judge dot-distances, confirms previously suggested three-systems for numerosity judgments.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107259,,Approximate number system; Density perception; Numerical cognition; Numerosity perception; Simultanagnosia; Subitizing,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report a simultanagnosic patient (ED) with bilateral posterior infarctions who produced frequent illusory conjunctions on tasks involving form and surface features (e.g., a red T) and form alone. ED also produced ""blend"" errors in which features of one familiar perceptual unit appeared to migrate to another familiar perceptual unit (e.g., ""RO"" read as ""PQ""). ED often misread scrambled letter strings as a familiar word (e.g., ""hmoe"" read as ""home""). Finally, ED's success in reporting two letters in an array was inversely related to the distance between the letters. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ED's illusory reflect coarse coding of visual feature location that is ameliorated in part by top-down information from object and word recognition systems; the findings are also consistent, however, with Treisman's Feature Integration Theory. Finally, the data provide additional support for the claim that the dorsal parieto-occipital cortex is implicated in the binding of visual feature information.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.017,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We asked both healthy participants as well as a patient with simultanagnosia to perform different visual search tasks of variable difficulty.

For healthy participants, we found that each visual search task was performed with a specific ""attentional field"" depending on the difficulty of visual object processing but not on the number of objects falling within this ""working space."" This was demonstrated by measuring the cost in reaction times using different gaze-contingent visible window sizes. We found that bilateral damage to the superior parietal lobule impairs the spatial integration of separable features (within-object processing), shrinking the attentional field in which a target can be detected, but causing no deficit in processing multiple objects per se.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/bhv059,,feature integration; parallel; posterior parietal cortex; serial; simultanagnosia,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

17354375,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

This led to damage to auditory cortex including planum temporale that spared medial Heschl's gyrus, and included damage to the posterior insula and inferior parietal lobule. She reported chronic difficulties with segregating speech from noise and segregating elements of music. Clinical tests showed no evidence for abnormal cochlear function. Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task-a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation-demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex. Further, the work demonstrates a (partial) lateralisation of the necessary anatomical substrate for segregation that has not been previously highlighted.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.10.023,PMC7856551,Audition; Misophonia; Music; Segregation; Speech perception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Using a single case experimental ABA design, we first determined that the optimal font for RN was size 16. In the baseline (A) phase, we assessed her ability to read all lower and upper case letters of the alphabet in black ink. In the intervention (B) phase we used font size 16 in red ink and an errorless learning approach to teaching the letters. Sessions ran 5 times per week (20 minutes per session). The intervention was then applied to picture recognition and word reading with four sets of 10 words and corresponding pictures. A consistent difference was noted between initial baseline and intervention. Improvement carried over when we returned to baseline.

The patient showed impairment of fundamental visual and visuospatial recognition, such as in object size, configuration, and horizontal point location, which probably underlay the mechanism of simultanagnosia and prosopagnosia. This case also suggests that the coexistence of simultanagnosia and prosopagnosia results from a right hemispheric insult, and damage to the temporoparietal area interrupts the incorporation of spatial information into object recognition. This disconnection of information flow, together with impaired object recognition per se, may impair the parallel processing of multiple objects, leading to object-by-object or part-by-part recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2015.1066827,,prosopagnosia for unfamiliar faces; prosopamnesia; simultanagnosia; spatial agraphia; superior temporal sulcus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
18514677,Simultanagnosia: effects of semantic category and repetition blindness.,"Coslett, H Branch; Lie, Eunhui",Coslett,"When confronted with two identical stimuli in a very brief period of time subjects often fail to report the second stimulus, a phenomenon termed ""repetition blindness"". The ""type-token"" account attributes the phenomenon to a failure to individuate the exemplars. We report a subject, KE, who developed simultanagnosia (the inability to see more than one item in an array) as a consequence of bilateral parietal lobe infarctions. With presentation of two words, pictures or letters for an unlimited time, KE typically reported both stimuli on less than half of trials. Performance was significantly influenced by the semantic relationship between items in the array. He reported both items significantly more frequently if they were semantically related; in contrast, when presented either identical or visually different depictions of the same item, he reported both items on only 2-4% of trials. Performance was not influenced by the visual similarity between the stimuli; he reported visually dissimilar objects less frequently than visually similar but different objects. We suggest that KE's bilateral parietal lesions prevent the binding of preserved object representations to a representation computed by the dorsal visual system. More generally, these data are consistent with the claim that the posterior parietal cortex is crucial for individuating a stimulus by computing its unique spatio-temporal characteristics.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.08.024,PMC2494704,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
16973181,Seeing trees OR seeing forests in simultanagnosia: attentional capture can be local or global.,"Dalrymple, Kirsten A; Kingstone, Alan; Barton, Jason J S",Dalrymple,"Patients with simultanagnosia often demonstrate 'local capture', meaning that they identify only the local elements of stimuli that contain a hierarchy of both local and global structures. Recent studies, however, have found that these patients may implicitly process the global form. We examined the general applicability of the concept of local capture, and specifically whether the global level of stimuli can be explicitly reported by patients with simultanagnosia. We tested a patient with simultanagnosia with globally biased stimuli such as hierarchical Arcimboldo faces and small, dense Navon letters. With Arcimboldo faces our patient often reported only the face and not the local elements--the first demonstration of global rather than local capture. With Navon letters, the patient's ability to report the global letter varied with stimulus density and inversely with stimulus size, so that local capture was found only with large and sparse stimuli. With both faces and letters, the likelihood of global capture by the patient was related to the ease of global reporting in controls, as indexed by their reaction times. This suggests that the patient's global perception is influenced by the same factors operating in healthy individuals. We conclude that attentional capture in simultanagnosia can be either global or local. Capture likely occurs because of a pathological restriction and/or rigidity of attention, but the type of capture depends upon the competitive balance between global and local salience.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.07.013,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

These contentions have remained controversial, but two recent reports in patients suffering from unilateral spatial neglect have lent some support to these views, suggesting that emotional faces capture attention more efficiently than neutral stimuli in the neglected field. Here, we investigate this phenomenon in a patient suffering from severe Balint's syndrome and consequent simultanagnosia. Using a visual search paradigm, we studied differences in the detection of angry, happy and neutral faces, as well as non-emotional stimuli. Results revealed that emotionally expressive faces, in particular anger, were detected more efficiently than other stimuli. These findings corroborate claims that facial expressions of emotion constitute a specific category of stimuli that attract attention more effectively, and are processed prior to attentional engagement.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2006.02.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We compared eye movements of simultanagnosic G.B. to those of healthy subjects viewing scenes normally or through a restricted window of vision. They described scenes and explicitly inferred attentional states of people in scenes. G.B. and subjects viewing scenes through a restricted window made few fixations on eyes when describing scenes, yet increased fixations on eyes when inferring attention.

Some hypothesize that this is due to a constriction of the visual ""window"" of attention. Little is known about how simultanagnosics explore complex stimuli and how their behaviour changes with recovery. We monitored the eye movements of simultanagnosic patient SL to see how she scans social scenes shortly after onset of simultanagnosia (Time 1) and after some recovery (Time 2). At Time 1 SL had an abnormally low proportion of fixations to the eyes of the people in the scenes. She made a significantly larger proportion of fixations to the eyes at Time 2. We hypothesized that this change was related to an expansion of her restricted window of attention. Previously we simulated SL's behaviour in healthy subjects by having them view stimuli through a restricted viewing window. We used this simulation paradigm here to test our expanding window hypothesis. Subjects viewing social scenes through a larger window allocated more fixations to the eyes of people in the scenes than subjects viewing scenes through a smaller window, supporting our hypothesis. Recovery in simultanagnosia may be related to the expansion of the restricted attentional window that characterizes the disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.07.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

A schema is an iconic representation where perceptual detail has been abstracted away from reality in order to provide a more flexible structure for cognition. Unlike truly symbolic representations of spatial relations (i.e., prepositions) a schema preserves some analog spatial qualities of the relation it stands in for. We tested the efficacy of schemas in facilitating the perception and comprehension of spatial relations in a patient with bilateral occipitoparietal damage and resulting simultanagnosia. Patient E.E. performed six matching tasks involving WORDS (in, on, above, below), photographic PICTURES of objects, and/or SCHEMAS depicting the same spatial relations. E.E. was instructed to match a single spatial relation to a corresponding image from an array of four choices. On the two tasks that did not include matching to or from schemas, E.E. performed at chance levels. On tasks with schemas, performance was significantly better, indicating that schematic representations make spatial relations visible in a manner that symbols and complex images do not. The results provide general insight as to how schemas facilitate spatial reasoning when used in graphic depictions, and how such theoretically intermediate representational structures could serve to link perceptual and verbal representations of spatial relations in the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2013.03.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect.

The component letters of a string benefit when they form a familiar global object, rather than requiring representation as multiple separate objects.

Though partial spontaneous recovery occurred in some cases, the precise cause(s) of this condition remained obscure for almost a century. Here, we describe a unique patient (EH) with a large right-sided occipito-parietal hemorrhage showing a complete loss of visual depth perception for several months post-stroke. EH could well simultaneously describe multiple visual objects - hence did not show simultanagnosia - but at the same time was completely unable to estimate their distance from him. In every 3-D visual scene objects appeared equidistant to him, thus experiencing a total loss of depth perception (""flat vision""). Neurovisual assessments revealed normal functions of the eyes. EH showed bilateral lower field loss and a severely impaired binocular convergent fusion, but preserved stereopsis. Perceptual re-training of binocular fusion resulted in a progressive and finally complete recovery of objective binocular fusion values and subjective binocular depth perception in a far-to-near-space, gradient-like manner. In parallel, visual depth estimation of relative distances improved, whereas stereopsis remained unchanged. Our results show that a complete loss of 3-D depth perception can result from an isolated impairment in binocular fusion. On a neuroanatomical level, this connection could be explained by a selective lesion of area V6/V6A in the medial occipito-parietal cortex that has been associated with the integration of visual space coordinates and sustained eye-positions into a cyclopean visual 3-D percept.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.01.029,,Binocular vision; Depth perception; Fusion; Parietal lobe; Stereopsis; V6/V6A,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

While the severe restriction of attention (simultanagnosia) and impairments of visually guided reaching have been extensively studied, oculomotor apraxia has received comparatively little attention. The main explanatory hypothesis of oculomotor apraxia is that it is a direct consequence of the severe restriction of attention. Here, we examined in a patient with Bálint syndrome to what extent local image features such as luminance and contrast predict whether a region will be fixated or not. During the viewing of natural photographs, the patient made saccades of very small amplitude, but showed strongly increased fixation duration. In addition, the horizontal and vertical range of fixations was severely restrained compared to control subjects. When analysing the local feature content at fixation, we found that central fixations of the patient contained less local luminance and contrast than fixations of controls while he made fixations to peripheral image regions with disproportionately high luminance and contrast. These findings suggest that while our patient gazes at central regions irrespective of their local feature content, he only looks to the periphery when his gaze is captured by particularly conspicuous features. We propose that oculomotor apraxia in Bálint syndrome reflects a combination of biased representations within a parietal priority map and increased fixational activity due to biased interactions within the oculomotor network.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-014-3839-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng
