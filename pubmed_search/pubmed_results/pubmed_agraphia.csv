6850274,Callosal apraxia.,"Watson, R T; Heilman, K M",Watson,"A 43-year-old woman suffered a spontaneous corpus callosum disconnection, resulting in apraxia and apraxic agraphia confined to the left hand. She initially had a functionally total callosal disconnection. With time, the splenium of the corpus callosum became functional, and a computerized tomographic scan performed five months after the onset showed infarction of only the body of the corpus callosum. Concomitant with this improvement in callosal function, the apraxia changed from ideational (loss of the concept of skilled movements) to classic ideomotor apraxia. A temporal analysis of this case provided support for Liepmann's (Liepmann, 1900; Liepmann and Maas, 1970) hypothesis that there is a centre for visuokinaesthetic (space-time) engrams in the left hemisphere of right-handed patients that controls skilled motor acts in either hand. This patient's recovery also allowed us a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying various types of apraxia.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/106.2.391,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

22075046,Callosal warning syndrome.,"Nandhagopal, Ramachandiran; Al-Asmi, Abdullah; Johnston, William James; Jacob, P C; Arunodaya, G R",Nandhagopal,"To report the clinical and imaging findings in a patient with an initial fluctuating disconnection syndrome due to corpus callosal ischemia that ultimately culminated in infarction with persistent symptoms. A 40-year-old, hypertensive, right-handed man presented with transient, stereotyped symptoms of corpus callosal disconnection (intermanual conflict, apraxia, dysgraphia and construction difficulties in his left hand). Serial magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated the ischemic nature of the initial fluctuating symptoms and later showed callosal infarction when the symptoms were persistent. Magnetic resonance angiogram did not reveal significant stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid or proximal portion of anterior cerebral arteries. Patient received standard treatment for ischemic stroke and at follow-up 1 month later, had mild left hand apraxia, dysgraphia and construction difficulties. The case highlights the unusual occurrence of crescendo transient ischemic attacks culminating in infarction in the location of corpus callosum. We have termed this novel stroke syndrome as 'callosal warning syndrome' as the temporal profile was quite indistinguishable from that of relatively well-known stroke warning syndromes in the location of internal capsule and pontine tegmentum.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2011.10.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
35903929,Capecitabine-related neurotoxicity presenting with agraphia.,"Iscan, Dilek; Tolay, Rumeysa; Bayram, Ertugrul; Demir, Turgay; Bicakci, Sebnem",Iscan,"Capecitabine is a pre-metabolite of 5-fluorouracil and is used as a chemotherapeutic agent. Among the common side effects of capecitabine, there are gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and dermatological side effects including hand-foot syndrome and skin pigmentation change. However, neurological side effects of capecitabine are very rare. We describe herein a patient who developed neurological side effects in the form of agraphia and dysarthria on the 7th day of capecitabine treatment. A 34-year-old male patient, who was being followed up with the diagnosis of colon cancer, presented with speech and writing disorder that developed while under capecitabine treatment. Dysarthria and agraphia were detected in his neurological examination. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute diffusion restriction in the splenium of the corpus callosum and at the level of the bilateral centrum semiovale. Brain MRI revealed symmetrical T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) signal increases at the right temporoparietal medial, corpus callosum level, and bilateral white matter level. The capecitabine treatment was terminated, and methylprednisolone treatment was administered and plasmapheresis procedure was carried out. Subsequently, significant improvement was observed in the clinical findings and neuroimaging. Capecitabine is used as an oral agent; thus, it provides ease of use. Neurological side effects associated with the use of capecitabine reportedly occur very rarely. The findings of this case demonstrated that leukoencephalopathy can be seen during the use of capecitabine, imaging results are very important in the diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy, and improvement can be achieved with the termination of the capecitabine treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,10.1177/10781552221116329,,Agraphia; capecitabine; neurotoxicity,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

1723332,Writing with the right hemisphere.,"Rapcsak, S Z; Beeson, P M; Rubens, A B",Rapcsak,"We studied writing abilities in a strongly right-handed man following a massive stroke that resulted in virtually complete destruction of the language-dominant left hemisphere. Writing was characterized by sensitivity to lexical-semantic variables (i.e., word frequency, imageability, and part of speech), semantic errors in writing to dictation and written naming, total inability to use the nonlexical phonological spelling route, and agrammatism in spontaneous writing. The reliance on a lexical-semantic strategy in spelling, semantic errors, and impaired phonology and syntax were all highly consistent with the general characteristics of right hemisphere language, as revealed by studies of split-brain patients and adults with dominant hemispherectomy. In addition, this pattern of writing closely resembled the syndrome of deep agraphia.

37478549,White matter tract disconnection in Gerstmann's syndrome: Insights from a single case study.,"Ranzini, Mariagrazia; Ferrazzi, Giulio; D'Imperio, Daniela; Giustiniani, Andreina; Danesin, Laura; D'Antonio, Valentina; Rigon, Elena; Cacciante, Luisa; Rigon, Jessica; Meneghello, Francesca; Turolla, Andrea; Vallesi, Antonino; Semenza, Carlo; Burgio, Francesca",Ranzini,"It has been suggested that Gerstmann's syndrome is the result of subcortical disconnection rather than emerging from damage of a multifunctional brain region within the parietal lobe. However, patterns of white matter tract disconnection following parietal damage have been barely investigated. This single case study allows characterising Gerstmann's syndrome in terms of disconnected networks. We report the case of a left parietal patient affected by Gerstmann's tetrad: agraphia, acalculia, left/right orientation problems, and finger agnosia. Lesion mapping, atlas-based estimation of probability of disconnection, and DTI-based tractography revealed that the lesion was mainly located in the superior parietal lobule, and it caused disruption of both intraparietal tracts passing through the inferior parietal lobule (e.g., tracts connecting the angular, supramarginal, postcentral gyri, and the superior parietal lobule) and fronto-parietal long tracts (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus). The lesion site appears to be located more superiorly as compared to the cerebral regions shown active by other studies during tasks impaired in the syndrome, and it reached the subcortical area potentially critical in the emergence of the syndrome, as hypothesised in previous studies. Importantly, the reconstruction of tracts connecting regions within the parietal lobe indicates that this critical subcortical area is mainly crossed by white matter tracts connecting the angular gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. Taken together, these findings suggest that this case study might be considered as empirical evidence of Gerstmann's tetrad caused by disconnection of intraparietal white matter tracts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.05.016,,Gerstmann's syndrome; Lesion Mapping; Optic ataxia; White matter tract disconnection; stroke,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

On language screening she was unable to write although she could read, and other language functions showed no abnormalities. Brain MRI showed acute infarction in the right angular gyrus. Her writing patterns displayed features of surface agraphia, indicative of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion with phonetic writing of targets. Additionally, she manifested visual errors. A functional MRI indicated that her left hemisphere was language dominant.

He reported that while he was sitting in front of his computer at home, he had performed a bilateral self-massage of his carotid arteries when suddenly the symptoms occurred. A neurological examination revealed a hemianopsia with a visual field loss on the right side. In addition, a mild aphasic syndrome with agraphia and a word-finding disorder (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS): 3 points) was diagnosed. The initial brain CT scan with CT angiography showed neither an intracerebral haemorrhage nor a cerebral infarction. Also, no occlusion or any signs of artery dissection or a flow relevant stenosis of the brain supplying arteries were found. After excluding other contraindications, an intravenous thrombolysis with weight-adapted alteplase was performed. The symptoms of the patient significantly improved in the short-term follow-up. Three days after admission no neurological deficits remained. The MRI of the brain revealed multifocal, small, left hemispherical strokes in the middle cerebral artery territory. In general, watershed infarcts after carotid sinus self-massage follow a rare ischaemic stroke mechanism.

It is recognized that cortical damage (i.e. focal lesions and atrophy) plays a role in determining the accumulation of physical and cognitive disability that is observed in patients with progressive MS. To date, an association of cortical lesions with clinical relapses has not been described. We report clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of five relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who had clinical relapses characterized by the acute appearance of cortical symptoms, due to the development of large, snake-like, cortical inflammatory lesions. Symptoms were: acute Wernicke's aphasia mimicking stroke; agraphia with acalculia, not associated to a motor deficit nor linguistic disturbance; hyposthenia of the left arm, followed by muscle twitching of the hand, spreading to arm and face; acute onset of left lower limb paroxysmal hypertonia; and temporal lobe status epilepticus, with psychotic symptoms. Cortical relapses may occur in MS. MRI examination in MS should include sequences, such as double inversion recovery (DIR) or phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR), that are aimed at visualizing cortical lesions, especially in the presence of symptoms of cortical dysfunction.

Among his written errors were phonologically plausible errors that were mostly homophonous or differed only in tone from their target. They occurred not only in writing-to-dictation but also in written naming. Since his lexico-semantic system is hypothesized to be largely preserved, as evidenced by normal performance on non-verbal semantic tests and word-picture matching, the presence of homophone and tonal errors strengthened previous claims about the existence of lexically mediated non-semantic pathway of writing Chinese and access from the phonological output lexicon to the orthographic output lexicon. In addition, his non-character responses, particularly those involving substitution of constituent(s), almost always maintained the configuration of their target. This observation implies that orthographic representations contain not only information on the identity of components but also structural information.

The graphemic buffer stores graphemic representations that handle the transition from spelling lexicon to writing or oral spellings. The authors report a case of a crossed pure agraphia, following the post-surgical removal of a right frontal low-grade glioma in a right-handed French patient. He presented a pure agraphia displaying the features of a graphemic buffer impairment. Our patient only made spelling errors, whereas repetition and other oral language abilities remained perfect. We found a greater number of errors for longer stimuli, increased errors for the medially located graphemes, and agraphia for both words and non-words and error types, essentially consisting of omissions, substitutions, and letter transpositions. We also observed no significant effect of word frequency on spelling errors, but word length affected the rate of errors. The particularity of this case was linked to right frontal subcortical injuries in a right-handed subject. To our knowledge, it is the first report of a crossed pure agraphia caused by graphemic buffer impairment. Further studies are needed in order to analyse the role of subcortical structures, particularly the caudate nucleus in the graphemic buffer during writing tasks, as well as the participation of the non-dominant hemisphere in writing language.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,International journal of environmental research and public health,10.3390/ijerph20021346,PMC9858865,frontal; glioma; graphemic buffer; language; right hemisphere; tumour,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The condition is characterized by a hesitant, incomplete, imprecise or even illegible graphomotor output. Letter formation cannot be attributed to sensorimotor, extrapyramidal or cerebellar dysfunction affecting the writing limb. Detailed clinical, neurocognitive, neurolinguistic and (functional) neuroimaging characteristics of three unique cases are reported that developed AA following a thalamic stroke. In marked contrast to impaired handwriting, non-handwriting skills, such as oral spelling, were hardly impaired. Quantified Tc-99m ECD SPECT consistently showed a decreased perfusion in the anatomoclinically suspected prefrontal regions. The findings suggest crucial involvement of the anterior (and medial) portion of the left thalamus within the neural network subserving the graphomotor system.

Method Initial testing revealed severe central alexia and surface agraphia with concomitant anomic aphasia. Intervention components included sight word drills, modified Multiple Oral Reading (MOR) procedures, functional reading tasks, and modified Copy and Recall Treatment. Intervention spanned 2 months with sessions 5 days per week. Data collection and analysis involved monitoring sight word decoding, reading speed and decoding errors during MOR, and spelling accuracy of Copy and Recall Treatment words. Follow-up testing occurred at intervention conclusion. Results Sight word mastery for 315 words progressed from 66.35% to 100% over 5 weeks and was maintained thereafter. MOR materials progressed from Grade 1 to Grade 5. Initial reading speed was 31 words per minute with errors on 15% of words. At program completion, reading speed was 47 words per minute with 7% decoding errors despite increased difficulty of reading material. The participant demonstrated initial mastery of 15 spelling lists containing 15 words each and sustained mastery (2 additional consecutive weeks of 100% accuracy) of 8 lists. Follow-up assessment revealed improvements consistent with 3-4 grade levels but persistent impairment relative to premorbid functioning. Conclusion The multicomponent program was effective in promoting substantial improvement, although surface alexia and agraphia persisted after 2 months of treatment. The case provides an example of the type and extent of progress possible given minimal initial recovery but systematic intervention within the context of intensive postacute rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,American journal of speech-language pathology,10.1044/2019_AJSLP-18-0245,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Both showed kanji (Japanese morphograms) agraphia due to impaired character recall, grapheme deformity and micrographia (progressive reduction in character size during writing) after a lesion that involved the ventral lateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei. Single photon emission computed tomography with a (99m)Tc-ethylcysteinate dimer revealed hypoperfusion in the left precentral gyrus (Brodmann Area 6) and anterior supramarginal gyrus in both. Six months later, the extent of blood flow reduction decreased in the supramarginal gyrus in both patients and the precentral gyrus in patient 1. By this time, the writing impairment improved to nearly the normal range. Our study suggests that kanji agraphia (corresponding to lexical agraphia in Western countries) with poor grapheme formation and micrographia arises from a lesion in the ventral lateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei in the left thalamus. The accompaniment of poor grapheme formation and micrographia may reflect disruption of the cortico-subcortical motor circuit involving the putamen, thalamus, premotor cortex and sensorimotor cortex. It is also suggested that multiple cortical sites can be a target for secondary dysfunction that yields agraphia in a thalamic lesion, and that the recovery of reduced cortical blood flow does not always proceed in parallel with that of agraphia.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-011-5981-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

However, language has the capacity to influence the selection of purposeful actions. The abilities to use language and to program purposeful movements are often mediated by networks that have anatomic proximity. With hemispheric injury, the diagnosis of apraxia is often confounded by the specific influence of language impairments on the ability to select and produce transitive gestures. We report a patient who illustrates this confound. This patient is a right-handed man who developed global aphasia and neglect after a right hemispheric stroke. His right hand remained deft, and when asked to produce specific transitive gestures (pantomimes), he often performed normally but did make some body part as object and perseverative errors. However, he did not demonstrate the temporal or spatial errors typical of ideomotor apraxia. He also had a perseverative agraphia. Our patient's left hemisphere praxis system appeared to be intact, and the error types demonstrated during production of transitive gestures cannot be attributed to a degradation of postural and movement (praxis) programs mediated by his left hemisphere. The praxis errors types are most consistent with a deficit in the ability to select the necessary praxis programs. Thus, our patient appeared to have dissociation between language and praxis programs that resulted in body part as object and perseverative errors.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770883,PMC3732537,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

11018248,Alexia caused by a fusiform or posterior inferior temporal lesion.,"Sakurai, Y; Takeuchi, S; Takada, T; Horiuchi, E; Nakase, H; Sakuta, M",Sakurai,"We evaluated the alexia and agraphia of three patients with different lesions using Japanese kanji (morphograms) and kana (phonograms) and made a lesion-to-symptom analysis. Patient 1 (pure alexia for both kanji and kana and minor agraphia for kanji after a fusiform lesion) made more paragraphic errors for kanji, whereas patient 2 (alexia with agraphia for kanji after a posterior inferior temporal lesion) showed severe reading and writing disturbances and more agraphic errors for kanji. Brodmann Area 37 was affected in both patients, but in patient 2 the lesion was located lateral to that in patient 1. Patient 3 showed agraphia without alexia after restricted lesion to the angular gyrus. We believe that pure alexia (patient 1) results from a disconnection between the medial fusiform gyrus and posterior inferior temporal area (the lateral fusiform and inferior temporal gyri), whereas alexia with agraphia for kanji (patient 2), corresponding to lexical agraphia in Western countries, results from damage to the posterior inferior temporal area, in which whole-word images of words are thought to be stored. Furthermore, restricted lesion in the angular gyrus (patient 3) does not produce alexia; the alexic symptom of ""angular"" alexia with agraphia may be the result of damage to the adjacent lateral occipital gyri.",{},,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/s0022-510x(00)00363-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

34327089,Meningeal Hemangiopericytoma Presenting as Pure Gerstmann Syndrome: A Double Rarity.,"Natteru, Prashant; Ramachandran Nair, Lakshmi; Luzardo, Gustavo; Shaikh, Nawal",Natteru,"Gerstmann syndrome is a neurobehavioral syndrome characterized by four cardinal symptoms: acalculia, agraphia, finger-toe agnosia, and dysgraphia. The syndrome is caused primarily by lesions at the confluence of parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, but also can involve the middle frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere. Documented inciting lesions include stroke, tumor, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, and seizures. A meningeal solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)/hemangiopericytoma (HPC) is a diagnostic challenge due to its resemblance to more common brain tumors like meningioma, with histopathology being the definitive diagnostic test. A 37-year-old male presented to our tertiary center with blurred vision, ""not being himself,"" and ""acting funny"" for three weeks. On exam, he was found to have a right inferior quadrantanopia, grade II papilledema and demonstrated all four symptoms of Gerstmann syndrome - inability to perform simple calculations (acalculia), or identify his fingers (finger agnosia), could not distinguish his left side from the right (left-right disorientation), nor write out his name (agraphia). Brain imaging showed an extra-axial, highly vascularized 7.6-cm mass compressing the left parietal lobe. He underwent a complete resection of the mass. Postoperatively, he had gradual improvement with complete resolution of agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation within a week status post-resection. Tumor pathology indicated hemangiopericytoma/solitary fibrous tumor. This case enunciates the enigmatic tetrad of Gerstmann syndrome. Though classically described as a sequela of stroke, the mass effect of the tumor on the parietal lobe may produce the symptoms, which can resolve following resection.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.15863,PMC8301724,dural mass; gerstmann syndrome; hemangiopericytoma; neuro oncology; solitary fibrous tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

In Case 1 aphasia was of transcortical sensory type, with severe agraphia and decreased comprehension of written words, although she could match them with pictures. Except for reading and writing, musical ability was normal; she could sing in five languages. Musical alexia and agraphia affected pitch symbols more than rhythm. Case 2 had conduction aphasia and severe expressive amusia, especially for rhythm. Although his language alexia and agraphia were milder than Case 1's, his musical alexia and agraphia were more severe, affecting rhythm as much as pitch. In neither patient were those aspects of musical notation either closest to verbal language or most dependent upon temporal (sequential) processing maximally impaired. These cases are consistent with the literature in suggesting that the presence or absence of aphasia or of right or left hemispheric damage fails to predict the presence, type, or severity of amusia, including musical alexia and agraphia. The popular notion that receptive amusia follows lesions of the language-dominant temporal lobe, whereas expressive amusia follows non-dominant frontal lobe damage, is an over-simplification, as is the view that increasing musical sophistication causes a shift of musical processing from the right hemisphere to the left.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.2.367,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We present a five-stage treatment sequence that was initiated at one year post stroke in a woman with acquired impairments of spoken and written language. As is typical of individuals with left perisylvian damage, she demonstrated marked impairment of phonological retrieval and sublexical phonology, but she also faced additional challenges due to impaired letter shape knowledge and visual attention. The treatment sequence included (1) written spelling of targeted words, (2) retraining sublexical sound-to-letter correspondences and phonological manipulation skills, (3) training strategic approaches to maximise interactive use of lexical, phonological, and orthographic knowledge, (4) lexical retrieval of spoken words, and finally (5) sentence-level stimulation to improve grammatical form of written narratives. This Phase II clinical study documented positive direct treatment outcomes along with evidence of a significant reduction in the underlying deficits and generalisation to untrained items and language tasks. Improvements on a comprehensive assessment battery were realised as functional gains in everyday written and spoken communication, including improved lexical retrieval and grammatical complexity of written narratives.

Following surgical evacuation of the hematoma, the patient improved. One month after onset, his language was quite intact and reading was possible. We hypothesize that this particular syndrome was the result of a double disconnection: alexia would result from a disconnection of the right angular gyrus and the occipital associative areas by a subangular lesion; agraphia would result from a disconnection of the right angular gyrus and the semantic store, probably located in the right hemisphere.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(94)90108-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We describe an exceptionally rare case of a right-handed individual displaying this deficit following a right-sided occipital stroke. A report of a single case of a 65-year-old man is presented with data from appointments with the neurology and neuropsychology departments that occurred approximately 10 and 12 months following the patient's stroke. During the evaluation, he exhibited a marked deficit in his ability to read, with vision grossly intact. His ability to write single words and short phrases from dictation was intact, but he was later unable to read them. This case demonstrates the complexity of the organization of language in the human brain. Although a large majority of individuals exhibit language dominance in their left hemispheres, it remains possible that some right-handed individuals may show atypical organization of language. This highlights the need for clinicians to consider atypical cortical organization when observed deficits may not necessarily match expected lesions within the cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Applied neuropsychology.

The authors report a case of pure agraphia following left thalamic hemorrhage. The patient showed impairment in the writing of both kanji and kana. The most frequent error in the writing of kanji was substitution (46%) followed by no reaction (23%) and partial omission or addition of characters (21%). The copying of kanji by hand was normal. Even when the patient was unable to write a kanji character, he understood the meaning and correctly recited the other readings. He complained that he could not recall the graphic image of the kanji. When we cued the patient by writing a part of a kanji he initially failed to recall, he correctly completed the character. The kanji and kana he was unable to write were inconsistent over time: in some cases he was unable to write words he had successfully written a week before, and vice versa. These findings suggested that the patient's pure agraphia resulted from combined impairments in recalling and selecting letters. While the thalamic lesion might have influenced the manifestation of pure agraphia, the dysfunction seemed to originate from the secondary negative effect of the lesion on the function of the left cerebral cortex.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,eng

On clinical, pathological, and radiological grounds, the neuropsychiatric presentation of multiple sclerosis may represent a clinicopathological entity of ""cortical multiple sclerosis.""

To learn about recovery, we recently reexamined this woman. This woman was tested for ideomotor apraxia by asking her to pantomime to command and to seeing pictures of tools. Whereas she performed normally with her right upper limb, her LUL remained severely apraxic, making many spatial (postural and movement) errors. Initially, she did not reveal loss of finger-hand deftness (limb-kinetic apraxia), and when tested again with the coin rotation task, her left hand performance was normal. Without vision, she could name objects placed in her left hand but not name numbers written in this hand. Since this woman had a callosal lesion, failure to recover cannot be accounted for by left hemisphere inhibition of her right hemisphere. Although failure for her LUL to improve may have been related to not using her LUL for skilled actions, her right hemisphere was able to observe transitive actions, and this failure of her LUL to produce skilled purposeful movements suggests her right hemisphere may have not had the capacity to learn these movement representations. Without vision, her ability to recognize objects with her left hand, but not numbers written on her left palm, suggests graphesthesia may require that her left hand did not have access to movement representations important for programming these numbers when writing.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2016.1148743,,Corpus callosum; agraphesthesia; agraphia; ideomotor apraxia; limb kinetic apraxia,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Evidence supporting the role of this area in reading comes from neuroimaging studies of normal subjects, case-controlled lesion studies, and studies of patients with surgical resection of the VWFA for tumors or epilepsy. Based on these prior reports, a small discrete lesion to the VWFA would be expected to cause alexia in a literate person without prior brain process, but such a case has not previously been reported to our knowledge. Here, we report the case of a previously-healthy 63-year-old man with the acute onset of alexia without other significant impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a small ischemic stroke localized to the inferior left occipitotemporal cortex, corresponding to the approximate location of the putative VWFA. Characteristic of pure alexia, testing in the weeks following the stroke revealed a letter-by-letter reading strategy and a word length effect on single word reading. Formal visual field testing was normal. There was no color anomia, or object or face recognition deficits, although a mild agraphia may have been present.

These ambiguities relate mainly to the long vowels, some phoneme-grapheme conversions, lexical particularities, and the connectivity of letters.

Initial testing indicated substantial impairment of CHS's spelling abilities in the form of mixed agraphia. The experimental study was specifically designed to explore the influence of the orthographic ambiguity of the Arabic graphemic system on CHS's spelling performance. The results revealed that CHS had substantial difficulties with orthographic ambiguity and tended to omit ambiguous graphemes. Some of the errors she produced suggested reliance on the sublexical route of spelling, while others rather reflected the adoption of the lexical-semantic route.

The patient also showed a complete inability to access the visual representation of letters. As demonstrated by a stroke segmentation analysis, letter substitutions followed a rule of graphomotor similarity. We propose that the patient's impairment was at the stage where selection of the specific graphomotor pattern for each letter is made and that the apparent selective disruption of capital case was due to a greater stroke similarity among letters belonging to the same case.

Initially, MH was an effortful letter-by-letter (LBL) reader, and she improved to become a proficient LBL reader. The initial fMRI results showed scattered activation on occipital and ventral temporal cortex during reading, which was localized to right FG in the follow-up study. KM's severe alexia with agraphia did not improve, even after 6 months had passed since the onset of the alexia. The initial and follow-up fMRI results showed no significant activation in the bilateral FG or central higher language areas during word reading. Our results suggest that the reorganization of the FG is different according to the type of alexia and the amount of clinical recovery in each patient.

De Smet et al. (2011), however, confirmed that AA might be associated with lesions outside the typical language areas such as the cerebellum or the thalamus. We report a 32-year-old ambidextrous patient with a left frontal lobectomy who following bilateral thalamic damage developed AA. Detailed neurolinguistic and neurocognitive test results were obtained after resection of an extensive left frontal lobe tumour by means of a set of standardised tests. Repeated investigations were performed after a bithalamic stroke. Functional imaging was performed by means of quantified SPECT. Normal neurolinguistic test results were obtained after tumour resection. Neurocognitive test results, however, showed a dysexecutive syndrome and frontal behavioural deficits, including response inhibition. AA occurred after a bithalamic stroke while non-handwriting written language skills, such as typing, were normal. Quantified SPECT showed a significant bifrontal hypoperfusion. Neurolinguistic follow-up findings and SPECT evidence in this unique patient with bithalamic damage for the first time indicate that AA in the alphabetic script may result from diaschisis affecting the frontal writing centre. The findings suggest that the thalamus is critically implicated in the neural network subserving graphomotor processing.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2015.01.012,,Apraxic agraphia; Bithalamic stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In this case report, we investigate the effect of multiple oral re-reading (MOR) therapy adjunct with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving reading recovery of a 64-year-old patient with pure alexia without agraphia following a stroke. His MRI revealed an area of infarct with microhemorrhages at the left occipitotemporal region. The patient was blinded to each therapy and underwent seven consecutive sessions of sham tDCS followed by seven consecutive sessions of real tDCS, coupled with 1-hour MOR therapy during each session. Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was performed at baseline, before sham and real-tDCS, and 6 weeks after completing tDCS therapy. The patient showed improvement using both sham and real-tDCS with better reading comprehension, average reading time, and word per minute after real-tDCS. This study suggests that MOR, coupled with tDCS therapy may accelerate the reading recovery in patients with pure alexia.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2021.1974487,,Ischemic stroke; alexia; homonymous hemianopia; multiple oral re-reading; transcranial direct current stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A Chinese patient, CSC, who demonstrated post-brain-injury mirror writing, was recruited. In Experiment 1, non-mirrored writing responses were obtained when CSC was instructed to copy asymmetrical non-verbal symbols and pictures. Resembling the patterns observed in a patient's writing reported in a previous study, it was hypothesized that CSC's mirror writing was a result of untransformed preserved grapho-motor patterns. In Experiments 2 and 3, CSC was further instructed to copy real Chinese characters, pseudo-characters with authentic radicals and logographemes (i.e., stroke clusters that frequently occur in radicals), and Hangul characters with stroke clusters resembling the shapes of authentic logographemes. The results showed that CSC demonstrated mirror writing only when authentic Chinese orthographic units were involved. Non-mirrored writing responses were obtained from stimuli without authentic Chinese orthographic units. In sum, CSC's performance supported the existence of grapho-motor patterns of Chinese orthographic units represented in the brain.

Few studies have demonstrated a visuospatial deficit in WD and to date there has been no report of neglect syndrome arising from WD. However, recent studies have demonstrated that neglect is frequently associated with brain damage including the primary site of WD, the basal ganglia. KHs writing abilities were evaluated just after her admission to the rehabilitation department and 6 months later. The baseline evaluation demonstrated that KH had neglect dysgraphia with verbal stimuli (e.g., words or sentences) although her deficit was less evident in drawing multiple geometric shapes. Six months after the initial evaluation, KH showed evidence of neglect dysgraphia only when writing was associated with a secondary memory task. KHs writing performance is discussed with reference to previous cases of spatial neglect dysgraphia and in the context of spatial neglect.

In several of these agraphic disorders, patients can make perseverative errors, and perseverative errors can even be seen in patients who do not have aphasia or apraxic agraphia. Patients who make continuous perseverative errors repeatedly writes the same letter (fruuuit) or word, and patients with recurrent perseverations change their letters, but then incorrectly use letter or word that was previously used (fruiut). We report a patient who demonstrated a different form of graphic perseveration. A 61-year-old man with a right parietal lobe lesion and left-sided neglect developed an inability to write. When attempting to write, he repeatedly wrote the same letter that he first wrote, and wrote these in the same spatial position as the first letter. When spelling, reading aloud, and using a keyboard to write he did not perseverate letters or words. When performing the cancellation test and drawings, he also perseverated.

Immune reconstitution by reducing the immunosuppressant dose stopped lesion expansion, and PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid for the JC virus became negative. Graft rejection occurred 2 months after immune reconstitution, requiring readjustment of immunosuppressants. Forty-eight months after PML onset, the patient lived at home without disabling deficits.

The characteristics of agraphia in the patient were as follows. 1) The written letters were generally recognizable and well formed. 2) He succeeded in pointing to single Kana letter named by the examiner from the Japanese syllabary, but missed in pointing to Kana words. 3) Further, it took more time for the patient to point to even single Kana letter than for the control. 4) Most errors in Kana writing was substitution. Errors in Kanji writing are partial lacking or no response. But his ability in Kanji writing was facilitated by visual cues. He was unable to describe the Hen (a left-hand radical) and Tsukuri (the body) of some Kanji letters and to name some Kanji letters when their Hen and Tsukuri were orally given.

In one type (Type 1), letters in writing are poorly formed, but the ability to make words with the methods other than writing, for example spelling with anagrams or typing are preserved. In another type (Type 2), letters in writing were well-formed, but spelling with anagrams or typing were abnormal. Type 1 agraphia could result from the only deficit of graphic motor engram, while type 2 agraphia could be caused by the deficits other than graphic motor engram. Agraphia in this case belongs to the type 2.

This suggests that the process of writing kanji involves a different pathway from that of reading kanji in the left temporal lobe. Pure agraphia of kanji is considered to be similar to lexical agraphia in Indo-European languages, in that the writing system with a poor or irregular phoneme-grapheme transformation is impaired by the left temporal lesion.

15788255,The crucial role of posterior frontal regions in modality specific components of the spelling process.,"Hillis, Argye E; Chang, Shannon; Breese, Elisabeth; Heidler, Jennifer",Hillis,"Although it is commonly assumed that posterior temporo-parietal regions are the regions of the brain essential for accessing orthographic representations for written output, patients with lesions in these areas also have reading and/or naming impairments at least early after stroke onset. This observation raises the possibility that these regions are important for components of spelling that are not specific to written output. The goal of the present study was to identify any regions of the brain that, when damaged, result in selective impairment in accessing orthographic representations for written output. We studied 54 consecutive right-handed patients with acute, left hemisphere ischemic stroke, who were barely able to perform the motor aspects of writing with the right hand and had at least 10th grade education, on a battery of lexical tasks designed to identify impaired and spared cognitive processes underlying spelling and with advanced magnetic resonance imaging. Only five patients had pure agraphia, and had evidence of impaired access to lexical-orthographic representations for output; and all five had infarct or ischemia in Brodmann's area 44 and 45. Analysis of performance across tasks of three of these patients, whose performance has not been previously reported, provides evidence for additional impairment in converting graphemes to letter shapes or letter-specific motor programs. These three patients, unlike previously reported patients with lexical-orthographic impairment and compromised function in Brodmann's area 44 and 45, also had infarcts in Brodmann's area 6. On the basis of these cases, and those in the literature, we propose a network of brain regions involved in writing words, each with a separate function. This proposal emphasizes the role of the left posterior frontal regions in modality-specific output processes.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790409609947,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Involvement of the central nervous system is rarely observed in RP. Here we report a case of encephalitis associated with RP. A 60-year-old man presented with headache and bilateral ear swelling. Three weeks later, he came to our hospital because of the acute onset of a speech impediment. A non-contrast computed tomography scan of the head showed slight high-density areas in his left frontal lobe, but he refused to be admitted and went home. On the next day, he developed acalculia, agraphia, right-left disorientation, and mild right hemiparesis. Brain MRI revealed hyperintensity areas in the left frontal sulcus on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and these hyperintensity areas were enhanced by gadolinium. Therefore, the patient's symptoms were diagnosed as focal epilepsy caused by meningoencephalitis. Other examinations, including laboratory blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid tests, and a cerebral angiography, were all negative. Therefore, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was performed 5 days after the patient's admission. Pathological findings revealed chronic inflammation of the meninges, so prednisone was administered. After receiving oral prednisone, the patient's bilateral ear swelling dramatically improved and the lesions apparent on cranial MRI gradually subsided. The patient was diagnosed with RP by a neurologist after discharge from the hospital.

She was congenitally right-handed. She had been a teacher of Japanese string instrument (samisen) playing and been able to sing Japanese traditional songs well. A tape on which she had recorded her songs one year before the admission also proved her to be a good singer. Neurological examination on admission revealed almost normal findings except for minimal weakness in her left hand fingers. Right temporal lobe hemorrhage was revealed by CT scan. One month after the admission, she complained that she was unable to sing her songs and to play samisen as she used to do. Her intelligence was normal (WAIS VIQ116, PIQ108) and there were no abnormal findings as follows: aprosodia, aphasia, agraphia, memory disturbance, agnosia and ideational, ideomotor, constructional or limb-kinetic apraxia. She could point out her errors while singing. However, musical receptive function was slightly disturbed with tonal memory in Seashore test. When she was asked to sing a song without any instrumental support, she hummed a melody occasionally with wrong pitch, but rhythmically. After hearing a song she knew well, she reproduced it with slight improvement. With the vocal or the instrumental accompaniment, she could sing fairly well. She had some mistakes of pitch while playing a samisen. MRI was performed one year and a half after the brain hemorrhage. It displayed a thin linear of hematoma in the white matter of the right upper temporal and transverse gyrus.

Writing with his right hand produced a fluent output in contrast to his nonfluent speech. The patient's agraphia disproportionately affected the writing of kana (Japanese syllabograms), leaving relatively intact the writing of kanji (Japanese ideograms). His kana agraphia, consisting of substitutions, intrusions, transpositions, and deletions, became apparent as the number of syllables in target words increased. Quantitative analysis of the substitutions in terms of their phonological similarity to the target revealed that most of the substitutions were phonologically dissimilar. Those errors were distributed almost identically for familiar and novel words. Moreover, the errors were observed asymmetrically across the target: more errors occurred near the end than at the beginning of a word. The kana agraphia in association with fluent writing output resulted in kana jargonagraphia. These observations suggest that our patient's selective kana jargonagraphia is best explained by selective damage to the hypothesized kana graphemic buffer and by disinhibition of the motor engrams of writing behavior, both of which resulted from right hemispheric damage.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1997.1865,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Improvement is also observed in tasks that do not involve visuo-manual component and that can all be consider to rely on a rightward (ipsilesional) orienting bias.

A long-lasting improvement concerned the right-page preference reflecting the ipsilesional bias but also the sloping lines and the broken lines reflecting visuo-constructive disorders in handwriting. Moreover, a transient improvement was also evidenced for the graphic errors. These results reinforce the idea that the process of prism adaptation may activate brain functions related to multisensory integration and higher spatial representations and show a generalization at a functional level. Prism adaptation therefore appears as useful tool in the theoretical attempt to identify the underlying 'core' mechanisms of the neglect syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.002,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Further, we propose that mirror writing in the right hemispace is attributable to activation of the damaged left hemisphere spatial system, which fails to assist in the translation of right hand motor programs into those appropriate to the left hand. Writing in left hemispace, in contrast, activates the intact right hemisphere based spatial system which guides the execution or monitoring of motor productions in left hemispace.

Imaging data revealed stronger fronto-parietal network activity including perilesional activation around Exner's area and precuneus for writing letters to dictation than for writing letters corresponding to their mental image expressions. Follow-up testing showed not only stable training effects but also an activation shift into the left angular gyrus.

Long words were affected more than short words, and performance was similar across different output modalities (writing, typing and oral spelling). This error performance was found despite the fact that both patients showed normal ability to repeat the same words orally and to access their full spelling in tasks that minimized the involvement of working memory. This pattern of performance locates their deficit to the mechanism that keeps graphemic representations active for further processing, and shows that the functioning of this mechanism is not controlled or ""refreshed"" by phonological (or articulatory) processes. Although the overall performance pattern is most consistent with a deficit to the graphemic buffer, the strong tendency for errors to occur at the ends of words is unlike many classic ""graphemic buffer patients"" whose errors predominantly occur at word-medial positions.

Semantically incorrect and correct homophones were spelled equally well, whether they were regular or irregular.

Those are the obvious symptoms of a cerebral infarction. However, less visible but burdensome consequences may go unnoticed without closer investigation. The importance of a thorough clinical examination is exemplified by a single case study of a 72-year-old, right-handed male. Two years before he had suffered from an ischemic stroke in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery, with right homonymous hemianopia and global alexia (i.e., impairment in letter recognition and profound impairment of reading) without agraphia. Naming was impaired on visual presentation (20%-39% correct), but improved significantly after tactile presentation (87% correct) or verbal definition (89%). Pre-semantic visual processing was normal (correct matching of different views of the same object), as was his access to structural knowledge from vision (he reliably distinguished real objects from non-objects). On a colour decision task he reliably indicated which of two items was coloured correctly. Though he was unable to mime how visually presented objects were used, he more reliably matched pictures of objects with pictures of a mime artist gesturing the use of the object. He obtained normal scores on word definition (WAIS-III), synonym judgment and word-picture matching tasks with perceptual and semantic distractors. He however failed when he had to match physically dissimilar specimens of the same object or when he had to decide which two of five objects were related associatively (Pyramids and Palm Trees Test). The patient thus showed a striking contrast in his intact ability to access knowledge of object shape or colour from vision and impaired functional and associative knowledge. As a result, he could not access a complete semantic representation, required for activating phonological representations to name visually presented objects. The pattern of impairments and preserved abilities is considered to be a specific difficulty to access a full semantic representation from an intact structural representation of visually presented objects, i.e., a form of visual object agnosia.",{},,Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,dut

Our objective is to study functional areas involved in writing network, based on the observations of different postoperative writing disorders in a population of patients without preoperative agraphia. We analyzed the postoperative agraphia profiles in 15 patients who underwent surgery for cerebral LGGs in functional language areas, using electrical mapping under local anesthesia. These profiles were then correlated to the sites of the lesions, shown by preoperative cerebral imaging. Our findings showed that (1) spoken language and writing functions could be dissociated, and that (2) writing is subserved, at least partially, by a network of 5 areas located in the dominant hemisphere for language: the superior parietal region, the supramarginalis gyrus, the second and third frontal convolutions, the supplementary motor area, and the insula. Each of these areas seems to have a different role in writing, which will be detailed in this article. However, among the patients, only those with lesions of the supplementary motor area did not recover from agraphia in the postoperative period (in 50% of cases).

Previous written treatment of non-homophones has attributed generalization to orthographic neighbours of treated items to feedback from graphemes to similarly spelled orthographic word forms. This feedback mechanism offers an alternative explanation for generalization found in treatment of spoken homophones. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underpinning generalization (if any) from treatment of written homophones. To investigate this question a participant with acquired dysgraphia and impaired access to orthographic output representations undertook written spelling treatment. Generalization to untreated items with varying degrees of orthographic overlap was investigated. Three experimental sets included homographs (e.g., bank-bank), heterographs (e.g., sail-sale), and direct orthographic neighbours (e.g., bath-path). Treatment improved written picture naming of treated items. Generalization was limited to direct neighbours. Further investigation of generalization found that items with a greater number of close neighbours in the treated set showed greater generalization. This suggests that feedback from graphemes to orthographic word forms is the driving force of generalization. The lack of homograph generalization suggests homographs do not share a representation in the orthographic lexicon.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2019.1629302,,Dysgraphia; Homophone; Language production; Spelling; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The purpose of this article was to examine a behavioral treatment sequence for such individuals intended to strengthen phonological processing and links between phonology and orthography, as well as train a means to maximize use of residual orthographic and phonological knowledge for spelling. Two women with persistent impairments of written language and phonological processing following damage to left perisylvian cortical regions participated in this study. Both exhibited characteristic features of phonological alexia and agraphia in that reading and spelling performance for real words was better preserved than nonwords (lexicality effect). A 2-stage treatment protocol was administered to strengthen sublexical skills (phonological treatment) and to train interactive use of lexical and sublexical information to maximize spelling performance (interactive treatment). Both participants improved phonological processing abilities and reading/spelling via the sublexical route. They also improved spelling of real words and were able to detect and correct most residual errors using an electronic spelling aid. Behavioral treatment served to strengthen phonological skills supporting reading and spelling, and provided a functional compensatory strategy to overcome residual weaknesses.",{},,"Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",10.1044/1092-4388(2009/08-0229),PMC3522177,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng
19235446,Alexia with and without agraphia: an assessment of two classical syndromes.,"Sheldon, Claire A; Malcolm, George L; Barton, Jason J S",Sheldon,"Current cognitive models propose that multiple processes are involved in reading and writing. Our goal was to use linguistic analyses to clarify the cognitive dysfunction behind two classic alexic syndromes. We report four experiments on two patients, one with alexia without agraphia following occipitotemporal lesions, and one with alexia with agraphia from a left angular gyral lesion. The patient with occipital lesions had trouble discriminating real letters from foils and his reading varied with word-length but not with linguistic variables such as part of speech, word frequency or imageability. He read pseudo-words and words with regular spelling better, indicating preserved use of grapheme-to-phoneme pronunciation rules. His writing showed errors that reflected reliance on 'phoneme-to-grapheme' spelling rules. In contrast, the patient with a left angular gyral lesion showed better recognition of letters, words and their meanings. His reading was better for words with high imageability but displayed semantic errors and an inability to use 'grapheme-to-phoneme' rules, features consistent with deep dyslexia. His agraphia showed impaired access to both an internal lexicon and 'phoneme-to-grapheme' rules. Some cases of pure alexia may be a perceptual word-form agnosia, with loss of internal representations of letters and words, while the angular gyral syndrome of alexia with agraphia is a linguistic deep dyslexia. The presence or absence of agraphia does not always distinguish between the two; rather, writing can mirror the reading deficits, being more obvious and profound in the case of an angular gyral syndrome.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

The patient was unable to grasp objects presented to the right visual half-field with the left hand, or to respond to contralateral somaesthetic stimuli with either of the upper limbs. This motor inhibition, with the associated extended posture, is described as a ""crossed avoiding reaction"", and attributed to the inability of one hemisphere to respond to visual or somaesthetic stimuli projected to the other hemisphere. Clinicopathological correlations and visuomotor coordination mechanisms are discussed in the light of previous clinical and experimental studies.

The patient's errors, in different fonts and scripts, consist mainly of letter substitutions (e.g., filo [thread] --> TILO). The results of various tests indicate that letter substitution errors arise because of a deficit in accessing the letter-form representations supporting written spelling. Letter substitutions occurred predominantly between letters with common strokes (e.g., C and G; b and p). Similarities in terms of global letter shape or letter sound were not valid predictors of letter substitution errors. Letter frequency, consonant-vowel status, and letter gemination were factors affecting letter substitution errors. The results of our investigation suggest that information about letter strokes are stored at the level of letter-form representations, and that access to these representations is sensitive to letter frequency. The results further indicate that letter-form representations do not specify whether a letter is a consonant or a vowel, or is a geminate.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.2001.2598,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

Gerstmann's syndrome is a combination of disorientation for left and right, finger agnosia, and profound agraphia, alexia, and acalculia. It is due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus, situated at the confluence of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report on a patient who suffered from severe underdiagnosed eclampsia and who developed bilateral extensive medial temporal, parietal, and calcarine ischemic infarctions during an eclamptic fit. In addition, ischemia destroyed the left angular gyrus. The combination of these lesions led to Gerstmann's syndrome with additional cortical agnosia and cortical diplopia. For the first few months following the ischemic insult, the patient had been cortically blind. Thereafter, the patient slowly regained a visual acuity of 0.1 in both eyes. She then experienced monocular and binocular diplopia. Her ocular motility was normal; there was no phoria or tropia. Monocular and binocular diplopia slowly became less severe over the following year. Now, 2 years after the incident, the patient has a visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes and no double vision. However, the handicapping symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome, which make leading a normal life impossible, have persisted--the patient still cannot cope alone, mainly due to the severe disorientation for left and right. The picture of cortical agnosia, cortical diplopia, and Gerstmann's syndrome is a very rare combination. Visual recovery and rehabilitation in cortical blindness are severely affected and made difficult by the symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome. In our case the reason for such a dramatic clinical picture was eclampsia, whose prodomes had not been diagnosed in time.",{},,German journal of ophthalmology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

She was a carrier of HTLV-I virus, and developed subacute right hemiparesis and marked motor aphasia. She had a malignant lymphoma in the left neck and basal cell carcinoma in the right inguinal region. Three months after the onset, she became unable to walk because of the right leg weakness or to speak because of motor aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal T2-high lesions in the white matter of the left frontal lobe, and a brain biopsy revealed demyelinating pathology. A biopsy of the left parotid gland revealed a diffuse pleomorphic type large B cell lymphoma. Although anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), no adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were found in the blood or CSF. The patient was then admitted to our hospital. Neurological examinations revealed severe motor aphasia, mild sensory aphasia/cognitive impairment, right hemiplegia, mild right hemihypesthesia, limb-kinetic apraxia in the left hand, idiomotor apraxia, agraphia, perseveration, marked spasticity and brisk tendon reflex in four extremities, and positive bilateral pathological reflexes. MRI showed multifocal T2-high lesions mainly in the cerebral white matter, predominantly in the left hemisphere, and partly in the cerebral cortex. No gadolinium enhancement was found. In addition, 99mTcECD-SPECT showed a broad decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortex. Anti-HTLV-I antibody was positive but anti-HIV antibody was negative in serum. ATL cells were found in 1-3% of the peripheral white blood cells after admission. CSF examination revealed that the cell count (1/microl), protein level (24 mg/dl), and IgG index (0.4) were all normal. However, the myelin basic protein level (321 pg/ml; normal < 102) was increased, JC virus DNA was detected by PCR, and anti-HTLV-I antibody (x 8) was detected in CSF. The regulatory region of the JC virus DNA in the CSF was partly deleted; immunostaining with anti-JC virus protein antibodies revealed the existence of JC virus in biopsied brain specimens, and these findings were consistent with PML. Her symptoms such as motor aphasia, cognitive dysfunction and left hemiparesis were subacutely progressive, and she developed akinetic mutism two weeks after admission. Since the efficacy of cytosine arabinoside for PML has been reported, she was administered 80 mg/day of the drug for five days. After treatment, her communication function was mildly improved but the efficacy was transient. Since it has been reported that HTLV-I, as well as HIV, activates the JC virus promoter and its proliferation, the latent infection of HTLV-I in the central nervous system (CNS) in this case might have stimulated the JC virus proliferation, promoting lesion extension over the cerebral cortex. There have been only a few reports of broad decreases in CBF by SPECT in PML patients. Further MRI and SPECT studies on PML patients are therefore necessary to evaluate the significance of HTLV-I in promoting the JC virus infiltration into the CNS.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

These disorders result in phonological errors typified by adding, omitting, shifting, or repeating phonemes in words during reading or graphemes when spelling. In developmental dyslexia, similar phonological errors are believed to result from deficient phonological awareness, an oral language skill that manifests itself in the ability to notice, think about, or manipulate the individual sounds in words. The Auditory Discrimination in Depth (ADD) program has been reported to train phonological awareness in developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia. We used a multiple-probe design to evaluate the ADD program's effectiveness with a patient with a mild phonological alexia and mixed agraphia following a left hemisphere infarction. Large gains in phonological awareness, reading and spelling nonwords, and reading and spelling real words were demonstrated. A follow-up reassessment, 2 months posttreatment, found the patient had maintained treatment gains in phonological awareness and reading, and attained additional improvement in real word reading.",{},,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,10.1017/s1355617798466104,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In the two other cases the symptoms arose secondary to posterior cortical atrophy, a slowly progressive dementia with alexia and agraphia. All three patients initially responded to a multicontext treatment approach with intensive verbal cueing and organizational strategies with subsequent improvement in visual recognition, reaching and scanning. Continued deterioration from posterior cortical atrophy or a second infarction resulted in worsening dementia in two patients. Cognitive remediation was required as visual perceptual rehabilitation became ineffective. Clinicians should be familiar with Balint's syndrome and its various aetiologies.

At 52 years of age, she was diagnosed as having WG by lung biopsy and elevated proteinase3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer. She had been maintained on prednisolone. Three weeks before admission, she developed deterioration of mental status. On examination, neurological abnormalities included right hemiparesis, confusion, memory loss, psychomotor slowing and agraphia. CSF was normal. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed high intensity lesions in the subarachnoid space over the left hemisphere. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed high intensity signal in the subarachnoid space with mild swelling of the cortex and abnormal meningeal enhancement corresponding to the high intensity area on DWI. She was treated with intravenous administration of methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide, and gradually improved in symptoms and abnormal hyperintensity on DWI. Involvement of the meninges in WG is rare. The dura mater is involved more frequently than the pia mater. Pathological findings of the meninges in WG has been reported to be granulomatous inflammation. Restricted diffusion in the subarachnoid space has been described to occur in a viscous mixture of proteins and inflammatory cells, similarly to the DWI hyperintensity in pyogenic abscesses. In our case, abnormal hyperintensity on DWI was interpreted as a dense inflammatory infiltrate in the leptomeninges.

19491470,Dissociative disturbance in Hangul-Hanja reading after a left posterior occipital lesion.,"Park, Key-Chung; Yoon, Sung-Sang",Park,"Since the Korean language has two distinct writing systems, phonogram (Hangul) and ideogram (Hanja: Chinese characters), alexia can present with dissociative disturbances in reading between the two systems. A 74-year-old right-handed man presented with a prominent reading impairment in Hangul with agraphia of both Hangul and Hanja after a left posterior occipital- parietal lesion. He could not recognize single syllable words and nonwords in Hangul, and visual errors were predominant in both Hanja reading and the Korean Boston Naming Test. In addition, he had difficulties in visuoperceptual tests including Judgment of Line Orientation, Hierarchical Navon figures, and complex picture scanning. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Hangul reading impairment results from a general visual perceptual deficit. However, this assumption cannot explain why performance on visually complex Hanja was better than performance on visually simple Hanja in our patient. In addition, the patient did not demonstrate higher accuracy on Hanja characters with fewer strokes than on words with more strokes. Thus, we speculate that the left posterior occipital area may be specialized for Hangul letter identification in this patient. This case demonstrates that Hangul-Hanja reading dissociation impairment can occur after occipital-parietal lesions.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.3233/BEN-2008-0211,PMC5452435,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

The difference between Kana and Kanji writing corresponds roughly to that between phonological and lexical systems in Western languages. When typing, most Japanese use alphabetical characters based purely on phonological rules. In particular, the Romaji system is used, in which a syllable consists of a single vowel, a consonant-vowel compound (e.g., ka, ki), or a sequence of consonant-y(semivowel)-vowel (e.g., kya, kyu). We describe a right-handed Japanese patient who developed pure agraphia that affected Romaji writing but preserved Kana and Kanji writing and who had a lesion in the left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus that extended to the anterior precentral gyrus. The patient demonstrated literal paragraphia in spelling Romaji across modalities.

Although the alexia extended to musical notes, he could interpret other musical symbols (e.g., treble clef). Appreciation of rhythm and expressive musical ability were relatively preserved, although judgment of other musical features (including discrimination of pitch, duration, and loudness) was compromised.

A patient (H.P.) was studied, who presented the four symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome in the absence of any other neuropsychological disorders. MRI showed a focal ischaemic lesion, situated subcortically in the inferior part of the left angular gyrus and reaching the superior posterior region of T1.

On the basis of an extensive cognitive investigation, language, praxis, memory and intelligence disorders were excluded. The four remaining symptoms (finger agnosia, agraphia, right-left disorientation and dyscalculia) were investigated thoroughly with the aim of determining any characteristics that they might share. Detailed analyses of the tetrad showed that the impairment was consistently attributable to disorders of a spatial nature.

We coined the term 'dystypia' for this peculiar neuropsychological manifestation. The symptom was caused by an infarction in the left frontal lobe involving the foot of the second frontal convolution and the frontal operculum. The patient's typing impairment was not attributable to a disturbance of the linguistic process, since he had no aphasia or agraphia. The impairment was not attributable to the impairment of the motor execution process either, since he had no apraxia. Thus, his typing impairment was deduced to be based on a disturbance of the intermediate process where the linguistic phonological information is converted into the corresponding performance. We hypothesized that there is a specific process for typing which branches from the motor programming process presented in neurolinguistic models.

Damage to the left superior parietal gyrus, an area of the cortex involved in peripheral processes specific to handwriting, should generate distorted graphemes but not misspelled words, while damage to other areas of the cortex like the frontal lobe should produce alterations in written and oral spelling without distorted graphemes. We describe the clinical and neuropsychological features of a patient with combined agraphia for handwriting and typewriting bearing a small glioblastoma in the left parietal lobe. His agraphia resolved after antiedema therapy and we tested by bipolar cortical stimulation his handwriting abilities during an awake neurosurgical procedure. We found that we could reversibly re-induce the same defects of writing by stimulating during surgery a limited area of the superior parietal gyrus in the same patient and in an independent patient that was never agraphic before the operation. In those patients stimulation caused spelling errors, poorly formed letters and in some cases a complete cessation of writing with minimal or no effects on oral spelling. Our results suggest that stimulating a specific area in the superior parietal gyrus we can generate different patterns of agraphia. Moreover, our findings also suggest that some of the central processes specific for typing and handwriting converge with motor processes at least in the limited portion of the superior parietal gyrus we mapped in our patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Brain research,10.1016/j.brainres.2010.05.046,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/4.5.555,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

This case of jargonagraphia in kanji suggests that this hypothesis should be supplemented by the following points: (1) in kanji, not necessarily a character as a whole, but radicals or parts of radicals, function as motor units, which may be released to produce jargonagraphia in kanji; (2) free-running on of visual images as well as of kinesthetic images should be considered especially in written jargon in kanji.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1994.1049,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

His left-handed writing was neologistic, whilst oral spelling, typing and spelling with the right hand were intact. Structural MRI scanning revealed a lesion of the body of the corpus callosum. Dichotic listening tests indicated that MCR displayed left hemisphere dominance for language. It is proposed that MCR represents a case of a disconnection syndrome in which right hemisphere systems that provide the basis for movement templates during left-handed writing are isolated from left hemisphere language systems. Analysis of left-handed writing indicated that peripheral movement control was highly structured with both individual letter frequency and sequential dependencies between letters represented within these motor control units. This case represents an opportunity to explore the mechanisms of movement control for writing and to examine the characteristics of isolated letter templates.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.12.011,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

15788254,"""Blocking"" lexical competitors in severe global agraphia: a treatment of reading and spelling.","Greenwald, Margaret",Greenwald,"Severe global agraphia in Patient MM is analyzed via anagram spelling. Errors in word spelling reflect conflict among lexical competitors and ""blocking"" of semantic errors by sublexical and lexical cues. Lexical graphemic competition predominates in the context of MM's nearly absent sublexical transcoding of phonemes into graphemes. His orthographic lexicon is severely impaired, resulting in poor activation of lexemes and impaired activation and inhibition of the grapheme level in spelling. In MM's multiple revisions of spelling errors, graphemes from more than one lexical competitor persist in an active state simultaneously. Experimental treatment addressed MM's impaired sublexical reading and spelling, and facilitated sentence spelling through functional computer tasks. Spelling treatment resulted in evolution of MM's global agraphia to surface agraphia. MM's spelling performance supports the claim that lexical and sublexical processes interact during normal spelling, and shows that severe global agraphia is amenable to treatment.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790409609946,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

A 44-year-old right-handed man suffered from a cerebral infarction with a mild right hemiparesis and speech disturbance. An MRI of the brain 1.5 months post onset revealed a lesion confined to the left central gyrus. One month after the onset, his spontaneous speech was dysprosodic and laborious. It was contaminated with dysarthria and phonological paraphasias. However, language comprehension, repetition and naming abilities were normal. Most remarkably he showed no impairment in writing with his left hand. Over the following months, his difficulties in verbal output showed general amelioration, but the isolated impairment in the domain of articulation characterized by dysprosody, dysarthria, and phonological paraphasia persisted. As for the symptomatology of pure anarthria resulting from precentral gyral lesions, there have been controversies about its pureness. Some argue that the so called pure anarthria always shows some degree of writing disturbances, albeit mild in degree. Others maintain there certainly exists the pure type without any signs of agraphia. In the present case lesions were limited to the central gyrus but spared the lowest opercular portion. The previous reports of pure anarthria that had mild agraphia all had lesions involving the opercular portion. We conclude the sparing of this area is most likely related with sparing of writing capacity in pure anarthria.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Surgical evacuation of the haematoma and excision of the malformation did not produce any modification of the reading deficit, which remained unchanged during a 4-year follow-up. The reading deficit was restricted to words and the patient was able to read only letter-by-letter, so that the whole words were reconstructed from the auditory names of the letters. So far, the disconnection explanation is the standard explanation of alexia without agraphia and the present case of verbal alexia may be regarded as being within this overall category. However, this explanation meets with unanswered questions that suggest more flexible interpretations. Neurolinguistic studies have questioned the unique character of alexia without agraphia as a clinical entity and, in contrast to the disconnection hypothesis, support the notion that the different varieties of alexia that are traditionally described represent distinctive syndromes, each with its own clinical features and pathophysiological basis. In this context, the reading properties in this case seem fully compatible with a deficit of the visual word-form system postulated by Warrington and Shallice, that is, the relatively early stage of the reading process through which a word-form or equivalent unit is attained. This system might be lateralized to the left hemisphere, as suggested by the fact that this case, like other cases of verbal alexia, had sustained damage to the left hemisphere and did not show any differential preservation of the reading of concrete words.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00313647,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Concurrent examination for anti-Ma2 antibodies in the serum was positive and confirmed the paraneoplastic origin of these symptoms. Patients with symptoms of limbic or brainstem encephalitis, especially young men, should be tested for anti-Ma2 antibodies in the serum to elucidate their origin.

This immune-mediated, steroid-dependent entity was first described thirty years ago. In this case report, we discuss the importance of considering this diagnosis in the evaluation of confusion. The patient is a 55-year-old African-American woman residing in United States, who was admitted to the hospital with a four-day history of mental status changes. Her past medical history was significant for type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, and Hypothyroidism. There was no reported seizure activity. The patient's vital signs were stable on admission. On examination, the patient was awake, alert, oriented to place and time. Her neurological examination revealed agraphia and dyslexia. Her speech showed lack of fluency and hesitation. Her complete blood count and electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient's brain CT scan did not reveal any significant findings. Her Magnetic Resonance Imaging only revealed mild chronic microangiopathy, which caused by ""small vessel disease."" Her Electroencephalogram did not reveal any finding consistent with seizure activity. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis was likewise did not reveal a cause for this patient's acute onset of confusion. In contrast to the above negative finding, this patient's Thyroid stimulating hormone was discovered to be 15 UIU/ml. She was subsequently given 1000 mg of intravenous Methylprednisolone daily for 3 days. This three-day course of high-dose, intravenous steroids resulted complete resolution of the patient's symptoms. She was then discharged on an eleven-day course of oral prednisone 60 mg. Hashimoto's Encephalopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an acute confusional state since it is responsive to steroid therapy and represents a readily reversible cause acute mental status changes. Clues to this diagnosis include elevated antithyroid antibodies, abnormal Thyroid stimulating hormone values, and exclusion of other causes of acute mental status changes.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cases journal,10.4076/1757-1626-2-7967,PMC2740226,,Case Reports,England,eng

Results showed a strong link between motor and perceptual performance. For reaching movements, performances in both production and perception tasks conform to the motor principles identified in healthy subjects (Fitts' law and motor anticipation). By contrast, for handwriting movements, DC's productions do not follow the motor principles usually observed in normal subjects (isochrony principle, motor anticipation) and in perception the same results were observed.

The only deficit of graphic motor pattern could cause Type 1 agraphia. In another type (type 2), letters in writing were well-formed, but spelling with anagram or typing was disturbed. The deficits of writing process other than graphic motor pattern could cause Type 2 agraphia. This typing seems to be effective not only in Kana but also in Kanji.

Here, the authors present the case of a patient who underwent an awake craniotomy for a left inferior parietal lobule glioma using direct cortical and subcortical electrostimulation. The use of subcortical stimulation allowed identification of the specific white matter tracts associated with reading and writing. These tracts were found as portions of the dorsal inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (IFOF) fibers in the deep parietal lobe that are responsible for connecting the frontal lobe to the superior parietal lobule. These findings are consistent with previous diffusion tensor imaging tractography and functional MRI studies, which suggest that the IFOF may play a role in the reading and writing processes. This is the first report of transient alexia and agraphia elicited through intraoperative direct subcortical electrostimulation, and the findings support the crucial role of the IFOF in reading and writing.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2014.2.JNS131234,,"AF = arcuate fasciculus; DTI = diffusion tensor imaging; IFOF = inferior frontooccipital fasciculus; ILF = inferior longitudinal fasciculus; MET = l-[methyl-11C]methionine; ROI = region of interest; SLF = superior longitudinal fasciculus; SLTA = Standard Language Test of Aphasia; VWFA = visual word form area; WAIS-III = Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition; WMS-R = Wechsler Memory Scale–Revised; brain mapping; fMRI = functional MRI; functional neurosurgery; inferior frontooccipital fasciculus; reading; subcortical stimulation; writing","Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Four weeks later, we performed a technetium-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (Tc-HMPAO SPECT) scan to study the patient's frontal lobe function. The SPECT scan revealed the causative bifrontal hypoperfusion, more prominent on the right, while the structurally evident cerebellar infarction was predictably masked by subacute hyperperfusion phenomenon. Contralateral frontal diaschisis is an established sequela of cerebellar infarction. Because this patient also had lesions in the left parietal region, her left prefrontal area was critically deprived of its major reciprocally connected cortical counterparts (right prefrontal and left parietal), and also became dysfunctional.

11239079,Superior written over spoken picture naming in a case of frontotemporal dementia.,"Tainturier, M J; Moreaud, O; David, D; Leek, E C; Pellat, J",Tainturier,"Two main hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of phonology in written word production. According to the phonological mediation hypothesis, the retrieval of the lexical phonological representation of a word is an obligatory prerequisite to the retrieval of its spelling. Therefore, deficits to the phonological lexicon should affect both spoken and written picture naming. In contrast, the orthographic autonomy hypothesis posits that the lexical orthographic representations of words can be accessed without any necessary phonological mediation. In support of this view, cases of preserved written naming despite impaired lexical phonology have been reported following brain damage. In this report, we replicate this basic pattern of performance in case YP, a 60-year-old woman with a pattern of frontotemporal dementia. As her disease progressed, YP's ability to write down the names of pictures remained very good despite a severe decline in oral naming. Further testing indicated that this deficit was not primarily due to an articulatory or post-lexical phonological deficit. YP's case provides strong additional support for the orthographic autonomy hypothesis.

MRI showed infarct in the left occipital and medial temporal lobe and hypoperfusion of the entire posterior cerebral artery territory, including the splenium. Extensive language testing revealed severely impaired picture naming and oral reading, with relatively spared tactile naming and recognition of orally spelled words, consistent with impaired access to lexical and semantic representations from vision. In addition, he had a milder deficit in accessing lexical representations for output from all input modalities. RMI's execution of various language tasks provided considerable insight into the mechanisms that underlie oral reading. His performance indicated that both semantic access and orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms were partially intact. When information from these two impoverished systems was coupled (the picture of an object presented with its written name), his ability to read/name improved significantly, consistent with the hypothesis that partially accessed semantic information from vision can combine with partially accessed sublexical orthographic to phonologic conversion mechanisms to access phonological representations for output. Furthermore, his written word and picture recognition improved to normal at a time when magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated reperfusion of the splenium.

The initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was reported consistent with left occipital infarction. Subsequent MRI demonstrated abnormal demyelination in subcortical white matter and deep parieto-occipital white matter bilaterally, but primarily left. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for JC virus DNA were both positive, consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with AIDS. His clinical status steadily deteriorated, and MRI white matter abnormalities worsened despite high-dose antiretroviral therapy. After the antiretroviral regimen was intensified by the addition of a protease inhibitor, rapid clinical and radiographic improvement occurred with subsequent MRI studies revealing only residual left parieto-occipital encephalomalacia. PML in AIDS patients has been associated with a nearly uniformly poor prognosis until recent reports of improved outcomes after highly active antiretroviral therapy. This patient with PML and AIDS similarly showed a robust clinical and MRI response to intensive antiretroviral combination therapy, which has been maintained for more than 3 years.",{},,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,10.1111/j.1552-6569.2001.tb00060.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
10071107,Pure apraxic agraphia with abnormal writing stroke sequences: report of a Japanese patient with a left superior parietal haemorrhage.,"Otsuki, M; Soma, Y; Arai, T; Otsuka, A; Tsuji, S",Otsuki,"A 67 year old Japanese male patient had pure agraphia after a haemorrhage in the left superior parietal lobule. He developed difficulty in letter formation but showed no linguistic errors, consistent with the criteria of apraxic agraphia. He manifested a selective disorder of sequencing writing strokes, although he was able to orally state the correct sequences. The patient's complete recovery after 1 month, without new learning, showed that he had manifested a selective disorder of writing stroke sequences. These findings indicate that the final stage of the execution of writing according to acquired sequential memory shown as a stroke sequence can be selectively disturbed, and should be considered to be distinct from the ability of character imagery and the knowledge of the writing stroke sequence itself. This case also indicates that the left superior parietal lobule plays an important part in the execution of writing.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.66.2.233,PMC1736213,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
9184100,Cognitive neuropsychological analysis and neuroanatomic correlates in a case of acute anomia.,"Raymer, A M; Foundas, A L; Maher, L M; Greenwald, M L; Morris, M; Rothi, L J; Heilman, K M",Raymer,"We describe an analysis of lexical processing performed in a patient with the acute onset of an isolated anomia. Based on a model of lexical processing, we evaluated hypotheses as to the source of the naming deficit. We observed impairments in oral and written picture naming and oral naming to definition with relatively intact semantic processing across input modalities, suggesting that output from the semantic system was impaired. In contrast to previous reports, we propose that this pattern represents an impairment that arises late in semantic processing prior to accessing mode-specific verbal and graphemic output lexicons. These deficits were associated with a lesion in the posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus or area 37, an area of supramodal association cortex that is uniquely suited as a substrate for the multimodal deficit in naming.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1997.1786,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng
22713399,The left superior longitudinal fasciculus within the primary sensory area of inferior parietal lobe plays a role in dysgraphia of kana omission within sentences.,"Shinoura, Nobusada; Midorikawa, Akira; Onodera, Toshiyuki; Yamada, Ryozi; Tabei, Yusuke; Onda, Yasumitsu; Itoi, Chihiro; Saito, Seiko; Yagi, Kazuo",Shinoura,"Functional neurological changes after surgery combined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography can directly provide evidence of anatomical localization of brain function. Using these techniques, a patient with dysgraphia before surgery was analyzed at our hospital in 2011. The patient showed omission of kana within sentences before surgery, which improved after surgery. The brain tumor was relatively small and was located within the primary sensory area (S1) of the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). DTI tractography before surgery revealed compression of the branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) by the brain tumor. These results suggest that the left SLF within the S1 of IPL plays a role in the development of dysgraphia of kana omission within sentences.",{},,Behavioural neurology,10.3233/BEN-2012-100147,PMC5294267,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
9642021,The contribution of attentional mechanisms to an irregularity effect at the graphemic buffer level.,"Annoni, J M; Lemay, M A; de Mattos Pimenta, M A; Lecours, A R",Annoni,"This study analyzes acquired dysgraphia observed in a French-speaking woman. The results point to an impairment of the graphemic buffer, i.e., the processing stage where abstract orthographic representations are temporarily stored while planning the written production. However, the spelling errors were more frequent in the irregular than in the regular words. A qualitative analysis of the errors in the irregular misspelled words showed that, in general, these were not ""regularization"" errors, but rather the same characteristics as the phonologically implausible errors found in the regular words, such as letters substitutions, deletions, additions, and transpositions. Furthermore, in a list of regular and irregular words of same length and graphemic structure, the errors not only tended to concentrate on the irregularity itself but also tended to be more frequent elsewhere in the irregular words compared to the regular words. These finding are discussed in terms of a post-lexical sensitivity to irregular spelling. It is also shown that when focusing attention on the irregularity becomes necessary, this can cause a detriment to the surrounding graphemic constituents. Interaction between attentional resources and processing of orthographic representations at the graphemic buffer level is considered.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.1997.1934,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
7992659,An unusual neurological feature of HIV-1 encephalopathy: Gerstmann's syndrome.,"Cirelli, A; Ciardi, M; Salotti, A; Rossi, F",Cirelli,"The authors describe the first case in literature of Gerstmann's syndrome (agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia) occurred in HIV correlated encephalopathy developed as the first severe manifestation of HIV infection in a patient with prevalent white matter neuroradiologic alterations. The PDL rapidly extended from the left subcortical parietal-occipital regions to the pre-rolandic one, with subsequent involvement of the corpus calosum splenium and the bilateral temporal lobes white matter. The authors indicate the extent of the lesions and the involvement of the interhemispheric connection fibres as the pathogenetic mechanism of the ""Gerstmann syndrome"", that until today has not been reported in the literature of the wide variety of AIDS dementia complex. The administration of 1 g of zidovudine for about 9 months did not avoid the establishing of the neurologic damage, but the sudden suspension of the drug could have enhanced the exacerbation of inflammation and the involvement of areas whose lesion is classically believed responsible for cognitive impairment.",{},,Acta neurologica,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Within the realm of Korean vocabulary, there are two categories of real words: pure Korean words and Chinese-derivative words. We present a patient with a history of CVA, resulting in phonological dysgraphia and, further, a dissociated performance in the aforementioned two categories of real words. It is suggested that the lexicon for pure Korean words is segregated from that for Chinese-derivative words.",{},,Brain and language,10.1006/brln.2000.2329,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

With some accumulated evidence, we report a case of diffuse brain injury in a 24-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated T2 hyperintense signals in the trunk and the splenium of the corpus callosum 12 days postinjury. Echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging was also performed on the same day, which revealed decreased diffusion (hyperintense signals) in the same site and almost the same size as T2 hyperintense signals. T1-weighted images were normal. Neuropsychological examination of the patient did not show callosal syndrome, namely hemialexia, unilateral agraphia and unilateral apraxia. Repeat MRI on day 20 demonstrated a signal decrease of both T2-weighted images and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) in the lesion. Follow-up MRI at 6 months showed complete resolution of the T2 signal abnormalities and of the corresponding decreased diffusion. Considering that diffusion-weighted imaging showed transient decreased diffusion, the lesion in the corpus callosum indicated the existence of cytotoxic edema. Also, transient DWI hyperintensity, namely cytotoxic edema, in the trunk and the splenium of the corpus callosum does not necessarily reveal callosal deficits.",{},,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/s0303-8467(00)00079-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng
