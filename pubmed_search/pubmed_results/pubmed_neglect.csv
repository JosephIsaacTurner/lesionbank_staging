35630076,Wernicke Encephalopathy Mimicking MELAS.,"Finsterer, Josef",Finsterer,"a stroke-like lesion, the morphological equivalent of a stroke-like episode and the hallmark of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, have not been reported as manifestations of thiamine deficiency. a 62-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted after a series of epileptic seizures. Upon waking up from the coma, he presented with disorientation, confusion, confabulation, psychomotor agitation, aggressiveness, right hemianopsia, aphasia, and right hemineglect over weeks. Electroencephalography showed a questionable focal status epilepticus over the left hemisphere, responsive to lorazepam and oxcarbazepine. Follow-up electroencephalographies no longer recorded epileptiform discharges. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2-/diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in the left occipito-temporal region that was not congruent to a vascular territory which persisted for at least nine weeks. Since a lactate-peak could be seen in this lesion by magnetic resonance-spectroscopy, this was interpreted as a stroke-like lesion. Since thiamine was reduced, the stroke-like lesion was attributed to thiamine deficiency after the exclusion of differential diseases, including MELAS and status epilepticus. The patient's behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions largely resolved upon vitamin-B1 substitution. the case suggests that thiamine deficiency presumably causes mitochondrial dysfunction with cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis and a stroke-like lesion mimicking MELAS syndrome. It should be further studied whether nutritional deficits, such as thiamine deficiency, could give rise to secondary stroke-like lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58050660,PMC9144475,Wernicke encephalopathy; lactic acidosis; spectroscopy; stroke-like episode; stroke-like lesion; thiamine deficiency,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
3340293,Altitudinal neglect.,"Rapcsak, S Z; Cimino, C R; Heilman, K M",Rapcsak,"Previous clinical observations on patients with hemispatial neglect from unilateral hemispheric lesions suggest the brain's attentional mechanisms are organized along the horizontal dimensions of extrapersonal space. We now report a patient with Balint's syndrome caused by bilateral parieto-occipital infarctions, who demonstrated altitudinal neglect. On visual and tactile bisection of vertical rods, the patient consistently placed her mark well above the true midpoint, and this performance remained unchanged when the stimuli were simultaneously explored visually and tactually. She also showed altitudinal inattention in the visual modality by extinguishing the stimulus presented in the lower quadrants during double simultaneous stimulation across the horizontal meridian. These findings suggest that bilateral damage to the parietal lobes can lead to multimodal attentional and exploratory deficits along the vertical dimensions of extrapersonal space.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.38.2.277,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

We report a new neurological sign, 'mirror agnosia', following right parietal lesions in which this ability is severely compromised. We studied four right hemisphere stroke patients who had left visual field 'neglect'. i.e. they were indifferent to objects in their left visual field even though they were not blind. We then placed a vertical parasagittal mirror on each patients' right so that they could clearly see the reflection of objects placed in the (neglected) visual field. When shown a candy or pen on their left, the patients kept banging their hand into the mirror or groped behind it attempting to grab the reflection; they did not reach for the real object on the left, even though they were mentally quite lucid and knew they were looking into a mirror. Remarkably, all four patients kept complaining that the object was 'in the mirror', 'outside my reach' or 'behind the mirror'. Thus, even the patients' ability to make simple logical inferences about mirrors has been selectively warped to accommodate the strange new sensory world that they now inhabit. The finding may have implications for understanding how the brain creates representations of mirror reflections.",{},,Proceedings.

25520023,"Hemispatial neglect: clinic, pathogenesis, and treatment.","Corbetta, Maurizio",Corbetta,"Hemispatial neglect is characterized by a failure of awareness on the side of space and body opposite the site of injury, has been extensively studied for its theoretical interest in revealing brain mechanisms of awareness and attention. More recently, it has become apparent that hemispatial neglect reflects not only damage of specific anatomical regions, but also the large-scale dysfunction of networks of brain regions specialized in attention, motor, and multimodal sensory processing. Finally, although previous studies showed that the symptoms of hemispatial neglect could be effectively, albeit transiently, improved by a variety of behavioral, pharmacological, and physical interventions, only recently have treatment studies begun to show long-lasting therapeutic effects. Future advances will require the integration of advanced brain imaging methods to identify abnormal brain circuitries and-in combination with sensory, cognitive, and neural stimulation-methods to modulate activity in those circuitries.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Seminars in neurology,10.1055/s-0034-1396005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
35204053,Visual Neglect after PICA Stroke-A Case Study.,"Geiser, Nora; Kaufmann, Brigitte Charlotte; Rühe, Henrik; Maaijwee, Noortje; Nef, Tobias; Cazzoli, Dario; Nyffeler, Thomas",Geiser,"After cerebellar stroke, cognition can be impaired, as described within the framework of the so-called Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS). However, it remains unclear whether visual neglect can also be part of CCAS. We describe the case of a patient with a subacute cerebellar stroke after thrombosis of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), who showed a left-sided visual neglect, indicating that the cerebellum also has a modulatory function on visual attention. The neglect, however, was mild and only detectable when using the sensitive neuro-psychological Five-Point Test as well as video-oculography assessment, yet remained unnoticed when evaluated with common neglect-specific paper-pencil tests. Three weeks later, follow-up assessments revealed an amelioration of neglect symptoms. Therefore, these findings suggest that visual neglect may be a part of CCAS, but that the choice of neglect assessments and the time delay since stroke onset may be crucial. Although the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, we propose cerebellar-cerebral diaschisis as a possible explanation of why neglect can occur on the ipsilateral side. Further research applying sensitive assessment tools at different post-stroke stages is needed to investigate the incidence, lesion correlates, and pathophysiology of neglect after cerebellar lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Brain sciences,10.3390/brainsci12020290,PMC8869876,PICA; free visual exploration; neglect; stroke; video-oculography,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

36340934,Right Unilateral Spatial Neglect Improves with Intrinsic Motivation.,"Saito, Hirotaka; Kobayashi, Haruka; Yatsu, Junichi; Obayashi, Shigeru",Saito,"<i>Background</i>. In the acute phase of stroke, it is well known that the incidence and severity of unilateral spatial neglect (USN) are more significant in the right hemisphere injuries. Still, the detection of USN in left hemisphere injuries has been increasing in recent years. This trend is because behavioral assessments have prevented the exclusion of patients who are difficult to assess for USN or apathy using conventional paper-and-pencil tests (e.g., aphasia). Right USN and post-stroke apathy share many common lesions. Therefore, clinical symptoms may overlap, but little validation considers this. <i>Case Study</i>. A man (62 years old) determined to have the right USN and apathy was treated for six weeks in 3 terms. In the first term (weeks 1 to 2), the patient was treated for the right USN by conventional therapy. In the second term (3-4 weeks), treatment for right USN and apathy by goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior was implemented. In the third term (5-6 weeks), goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior was discontinued, and treatment was returned to conventional therapy only. In the second term (goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior), the improvement in patients' apathy (clinical assessment for spontaneity) was more significant than the effect size in the third term (conventional therapy). There were no significant differences in USN (catherine bergego scale) and intrinsic motivation (pittsburgh rehabilitation participation scale). However, the effect size in the second term tended to be larger than in the third term (conventional therapy). <i>Clinical Rehabilitation Impact</i>. This report aims to demonstrate the limitations of current treatment for cases determined to have both right USN and apathy. Second, to assess the extent to which this new intervention can complement the limitations of current treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2022/4828549,PMC9633176,,Case Reports,United States,eng
12580716,Callosal neglect.,"Heilman, Kenneth M; Adams, David J",Heilman,"According to the interhemispheric inhibition model of neglect, the uninjured hemisphere inhibits (via the corpus callosum) the injured hemisphere but the injured hemisphere can no longer inhibit the opposite hemisphere, which becomes hyperactive and produces an ipsilesional attentional bias. Alternatively, according to the compensation hypothesis, the uninjured hemisphere helps compensate for the damaged hemisphere, which is impaired in directing attention to contralateral stimuli. If the inhibition model of neglect is correct, callosal disconnection should reduce neglect. If the compensation model is correct, however, it may increase or induce neglect. A 32-year-old woman, at age 14 years, developed a right frontal astrocytoma and was treated with surgery and radiation but had a cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to aspiration. Subsequent imaging studies revealed damage to the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions of the right hemisphere and damage to the temporal region of the left hemisphere. After discharge, she was able to return to school and drive a car, without any evidence of neglect. About 10 years later, she developed complex partial and atonic seizures that were multifocal and medically intractable. She underwent a complete section of her corpus callosum at age 31 years. One year after the callosal section, she demonstrated (1) diminished spontaneous saccades to the left, hypometric leftward saccades, and left gaze impersistence; (2) left arm hemispatial limb akinesia; (3) unilateral spatial neglect; and (4) motor and cognitive impersistence.

35046075,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in the puerperium: a case report.,"Dunphy, Louise; Kothari, Trusha; Ford, Jonathan",Dunphy,"Headache is a common presentation to the physician. Although most causes of a headache in pregnancy are benign, the pregnant woman is at risk of a life-threatening secondary headache such as eclampsia, venous sinus thrombosis or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Pregnancy and the puerperium are prothrombotic risk factors. Although the aetiology of PRES remains to be fully elucidated, hypertension with failed autoregulation results in brain oedema. An alternative hypothesis includes endothelial injury and hypoperfusion leading to an alteration in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. It occurs in complex, systemic conditions such as pre-eclampsia, following bone marrow transplantation, chemotherapy, sepsis and autoimmune diseases. The most common clinical presentation is headache, altered alertness, seizures and visual disturbance such as hemianopia, visual neglect and cortical blindness. It can also develop in normotensive individuals. Symmetric vasogenic oedema in a watershed distribution involving the parieto-occipital regions are typically evident on MRI. Management is determined by the underlying aetiological risk factor. The authors present the case of a 32-year-old multiparous woman presenting with tonic-clonic seizures 16 days following an elective caesarean section. Her pregnancy was complicated by hypertension and headache. There was no history of pre-eclampsia. She required intubation and ventilation. The diagnosis of PRES was established on MRI. Early recognition and treatment provide a favourable prognosis as the clinical symptoms and imaging characteristics are reversible in a large cohort of affected individuals.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2021-246570,PMC8772398,emergency medicine; neurology; obstetrics and gynaecology,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

27450929,The role of parieto-temporal connectivity in pure neglect dyslexia.,"Ptak, Radek; Di Pietro, Marie; Pignat, Jean-Michel",Ptak,"The initial stages of reading are characterised by parallel and effortless access to letters constituting a word. Neglect dyslexia is an acquired reading disorder characterised by omission or substitution of the initial or the final letters of words. Rarely, the disorder appears in a'pure' form that is, without other signs of spatial neglect. Neglect dyslexia is linked to damage involving the inferior parietal lobe and regions of the temporal lobe, but the precise anatomical basis of the pure form of the disorder is unknown. Here, we show that pure neglect dyslexia is associated with decreased structural connectivity between the inferior parietal and lateral temporal lobe. We examined patient DM, who following bilateral occipito-parietal damage presented left neglect dyslexia together with right visual field loss, but no signs of spatial neglect. DM's reading errors were affected by word length and were much more frequent for pseudowords than for existing words. Most errors were omissions or substitutions of the first or second letter, and the spatial distribution of errors was similar for stimuli presented left or right of fixation. The brain lesions of DM comprised the inferior and superior parietal lobule as well as the cuneus and precuneus of the left hemisphere, and the angular gyrus and lateral occipital cortex of the right hemisphere. Diffusion tensor imaging revealed bilateral decrease of fibre tracts connecting the inferior parietal lobule with the superior and middle temporal cortex.

We describe a patient who had these signs of neglect 7 months after a left cerebellar hemorrhage. This 61-year-old right-handed woman reported emotional lability and difficulty walking, frequently bumping into things on her left side. Neurologic examination revealed ocular dysmetria and left-side limb ataxia. Neuropsychological tests showed evidence of neglect. On a clock-drawing test, the patient accurately drew a circle but her number placement deviated to the left side. She showed the same leftward deviation when she tried to draw a circle composed of small triangles. Although her line bisection was normal, on an allocentric task of open-triangle cancellation she was most likely to neglect triangles with a left-side opening. Her performance on this task indicated left allocentric neglect. Her leftward deviation on the clock and figure drawing tasks seems to be a form of an action-intentional grasp, which may have been induced by right frontal dysfunction superimposed on a deficit of global attention.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000033,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

General cognitive function was preserved with Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) 25/30 (cut-off score 20). In terms of recognition of faces, tasks not requiring recognition of facial identity, such as interpreting facial emotions, and gender and age assessment, were relatively preserved, but recognition of family members and celebrities was severely impaired, and matching unfamiliar faces was slightly impaired. Semantic information of family and friends was retained. Although his symptoms resembled associative prosopagnosia, they differed from general associative prosopagnosia in having phonagnosia.

32765410,Acquired Visual Deficits Independent of Lesion Site in Acute Stroke.,"Wijesundera, Chamini; Vingrys, Algis J; Wijeratne, Tissa; Crewther, Sheila G",Wijesundera,"Most clinical diagnoses of stroke are based on the persistence of symptoms relating to consciousness, language, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, neglect (visual), motor strength, and sensory loss following acute cerebral infarction. Yet despite the fact that most motor actions and cognition are driven by vision, functional vision <i>per se</i> is seldom tested rigorously during hospitalization. Hence we set out to determine the effects of acute stroke on functional vision, using an iPad application (Melbourne Rapid Field-Neural) that can be used to assess vision (visual acuity and visual field sensitivity) at the bedside or in the emergency ward in about 6 min per eye. Our convenience sample comprised 60 (29-88 years, 65 ± 14 years, 33 males) of 160 sequentially presenting first episode, acute (<7 days) ischemic stroke patients at Sunshine Hospital, Melbourne. One hundred patients were excluded due to existing eye disease, inadequate radiological confirmation, inability to comply with English directions or too ill to participate. Stroke cases were compared with 37 (29-85 years, 64 ± 12 years,14 males) similar-aged controls using a Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test. A significant loss in visual field sensitivity was measured in 68% of stroke cases (41/60, Mean Deviation: Stroke: -5.39 ± 6.26 dB, Control: 0.30 ± 0.60 dB, MWU = 246, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Surprisingly, 44% (18/41) of these patients were unaware of their field loss. Although high contrast visual acuity was unaffected in most (55/60) patients, visual acuity-in-noise was reduced in 62% (37/60, Stroke: mean 6/12-2, log MAR 0.34 ± 0.21 vs. Control: mean 6/7·5-2, log MAR 0.14 ± 0.10; MWU = 470, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Visual field defects were associated with all occipital, parietal and posterior cerebellar artery strokes while 9/15 middle cerebral artery lesions and 11 lesions in other brain regions were also associated with visual field defects. Our findings demonstrate that ~2/3 of acute first episode ischemic stroke patients experience acquired vision deficits, often unrelated to the confirmed lesion site. Our results also imply that visual dysfunction may be associated with a more generalized cerebral dysfunction while highlighting the need for bedside testing of vision for every stroke patient and demonstrating the translational clinical value of the ""Melbourne Rapid Field- Neural"" iPad application. <b>Clinical Trial:</b> http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12618001111268.aspx.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.00705,PMC7380328,Melbourne Rapid Field-Neural (MRFn); acute stroke; ischemic; vision; visual acuity-in-noise; visual field; visual function,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Advanced anatomical investigation suggested a disconnection between the parietal and the temporal lobes in the right hemisphere.

On day 57, he noticed a supernumerary motor phantom limb (SPL) involving his right arm, originating at the level of the elbow. The most notable finding of his SPL was the motor characteristic. When the subject had the intention to move the upper paralyzed limb simultaneously with the trainer's facilitating action, he said ""there is another arm."" The intention to move the paralyzed arm alone or passive movement of the paralyzed arm did not induce the SPL. He showed a severe left sensorimotor impairment and mild hemineglect, but no neglect syndromes of the body (e.g., asomatognosia, somatoparaphrenia, personification and misoplegia, or anosognosia) were observed. Brain MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the right temporal lobe subcortex, subfrontal cortex, putamen, internal capsule, and thalamus. Single-photon emission computed tomography images showed more widespread hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere in comparison to the lesions on MRI. However, the premotor cortex was preserved. Our case is different from Staub's case in that SPL was not induced by the intention to move the paralyzed limb alone; rather, it was induced when the patient intended to move the paralyzed limb with a trainer's simultaneous facilitating action. The SPL may reflect that an abnormal closed-loop function of the thalamocortical system underlies the phantom phenomenon. However, despite the severe motor and sensory impairment, the afferent pathway from the periphery to the premotor cortex may have been partially preserved, and this may have been related to the induction of SPL.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513302,PMC8138257,Intentional motor phantom limb; Premotor cortex; Stroke; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The present case describes an inpatient neuropsychological evaluation with a 67-year-old, African American man presenting with right hemispatial neglect following resection of a large glioblastoma in the left occipitotemporoparietal region. The evaluation included a clinical interview, neurobehavioral status examination, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results documented consistent evidence of right hemispatial neglect across the administered tests, which could not be attributed to an established right visual field cut. Neuropsychological testing also revealed nearly global deficits in complex visuoperception, posterior/receptive language, memory, and complex attention/executive functioning abilities, while basic attention remained intact. Further remarkable findings of this case included color anomia and transcortical sensory aphasia. Findings from the case are discussed in the context of the preexisting literature on hemispatial neglect and the theoretical specialization of the parietal lobe for spatial attention/awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Applied neuropsychology.

Individuals with a bilateral ventral temporal-occipital lesion have been shown to demonstrate upper vertical neglect, and those with a bilateral parietal-occipital lesion have been shown to demonstrate lower vertical neglect. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of individuals with vertical neglect from a unilateral hemispheric lesion. We report on a 72-year-old, right-handed male who developed transient left hemiparesis. On examination, he had left facial weakness and he bisected horizontal lines to the left of the midline (ie, ipsilesional neglect). In addition, on a line bisection test involving nine vertical line bisections, he demonstrated downward deviation in the majority of the trials; healthy individuals deviate upward. On brain imaging, our patient revealed a cerebral infarction, primarily affecting the right temporal lobe; the temporal lobes contain the ventral attentional network that allocates attention upward. There is also some evidence that, whereas the right hemisphere mediates attention upward, the left mediates attention downward. Therefore, injury to the right temporal lobe may account for our patient's upward neglect with downward deviation. However, further studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of vertical neglect.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000221,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Right brain damage can bring about another representational spatial disorder, termed «hyperschematia», and defined by a left-sided disproportionate expansion of drawings by copy and from memory, and by an overestimation of left lateral extent when a leftward movement is required. This case study aimed at evaluating the effect of PA induced by prismatic lenses creating a shift to the left on hyperschematia signs. A 63-year-old woman with left hyperschematia, consecutive to a right fronto-temporo-parietal hematoma, was exposed to a leftward optical deviation produced by prismatic lenses. An anatomical MRI studied topography of the brain lesion; the patient's lesion was then mapped onto tractography reconstructions of white matter pathways. Results showed that PA significantly reduced the left-sided expansion of drawing by copy and from memory, and the overestimation of left lateral extent, immediately after prism removal and 4 days later, indicating a persistent long lasting cognitive effect. MRI showed a right hemisphere disconnection of the posterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, and of the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. Overall, these findings suggest that: i) PA is effective also in hyperschematia by re-orientating spatial attention towards the right side of space, with a relative rightward PA-induced unbalance, and re-setting the spatial representation to the left side of space, contralateral to the side of the lesion; ii) the left misrepresentation of lateral extent may be related to a disconnection between visual coordinates and attentional networks to the frontal lobe.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.04.002,,Bottom-up; Hyperschematia; Prism adaptation; Space representation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Our understanding of this phenomena is limited, with unknown occurrence across different reference frames, such as distance (peripersonal vs. extrapersonal) and system of reference (egocentric vs. allocentric). Two patients with acute bilateral (P1) or right hemispheric (P2) stroke, with signs of bottom altitudinal neglect, underwent an extensive evaluation of neglect within 10 days post-stroke. Assessments involved altitudinal neglect and unilateral spatial neglect (USN) in peripersonal space, exploring egocentric and allocentric signs and in extrapersonal space. Compared to a control group of 15 healthy age-matched subjects, patients showed allocentric and egocentric left USN in peripersonal space, and mostly allocentric signs of altitudinal neglect. No signs of neglect were evidenced in extrapersonal space. Altitudinal neglect could thus present as an allocentric form of spatial neglect, suggesting that allocentric representations may not only affect the deployment of attentional resources along horizontal dimensions but also operate along vertical dimensions. Future studies should deepen our understanding of altitudinal neglect, eventually leading to further unravel spatial processes that control attention, their corresponding brain mechanisms, and implications for patients' rehabilitation and functional outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2024.2315860,,Spatial neglect; allocentric and egocentric reference; altitudinal neglect; spatial processing; stroke,Journal Article; Case Reports; Observational Study,England,eng

Several theories have been established, and some earlier reports hypothesized the relation to laterality. However, some cases could not be fully explained by the laterality theory (1). To clarify the gustatory pathway, we reported a case with bilateral hypogeusia after right thalamic infarction. This 55-year-old, right-handed man suffered from sudden decreased sensitivity of taste. He was unable to differentiate sweetness and saltiness at bilateral anterior parts of tongue. Additionally, there was numbness at the upper palate and the lips. Neurological examination revealed decreased taste sense at both sides of his anterior tongue and decreased pin-prick sensation of the left part of his lips. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed acute ischemic stroke at the right ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM). Thus, single antiplatelet therapy was administered. Two weeks later, the symptoms improved significantly and completely recovered without sequelae. The exact gustatory pathway in humans remains uncertain nowadays. First, there were few reports about dysgeusia, which might be related to clinical neglect of taste deficits. Second, our knowledge of the human gustatory pathway depends solely on sporadic cases of taste-involved brain lesions. We reported a case of bilateral hypogeusia after right thalamic infarction. This finding indicates that, although there might be laterality of gustatory fibers to the left hemisphere, anatomical variations may exist in the human gustatory system.

Supplementary motor area stroke, as a syndrome, has variable symptoms consisting of impairment of volitional movements, hemineglect, dyspraxia of contralateral limbs, impaired muscle tone, mutism and contralateral weakness.

The patient presented with a Hunt and Hess grade III subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 days after developing thunderclap headache. She underwent successful coiling under general anesthesia of the 1.6 × 1.5 × 1.6 cm aneurysm, but immediately after the coil was placed occlusion of the proximal M1 segment was developed. This occlusion was stented after ~5-min delay, and flow restored without angiographic evidence of distal emboli. Following the procedure, she was extubated and noted to have left hemiparesis, neglect, and mutism without a CT correlate. Cerebral infarction was suspected, but urgent repeat angiography demonstrated patent cerebral vasculature. On the following day, symptoms persisted, and non-contrast head CT now showed cerebral edema localized to the right middle cerebral artery territory mimicking subacute infarction. CT perfusion imaging and angiography showed a widely patent MCA circulation, and suggested a regional hyperperfusion syndrome.

A 65-year-old male patient was admitted due to left limb weakness. On arrival, he had moderate left hemiplegia, neglect, and sensory loss; the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 8. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance (MR) examination were performed to determine the cause of basal ganglia infarction. Thin-section axial CTA showed a membrane-like structure in the posterior wall of the right common carotid artery. The sagittal reconstruction image showed a membrane-like protrusion in the posterior wall of the right common carotid artery under the right carotid sinus. The MR axial T2 image showed a membrane-like high-signal protrusion into the carotid artery lumen, which was diagnosed as a right carotid web. The patient was treated with dual antihypertensive therapy by adjusting blood pressure, controlling brain edema, improving cerebral circulation, and nourishing the nerves. Careful comparison of axial thin-layer CTA and MR axial T2 images combined with sagittal reconstruction of CTA images can greatly improve the diagnostic rate of carotid web.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC medical imaging,10.1186/s12880-020-00536-6,PMC7789621,CTA; Carotid web; Common carotid artery; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

37214406,Case report of iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy after exposure to Lyodura: an Australian perspective.,"Muller, Claire",Muller,"Recently proposed diagnostic criteria for iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (iCAA) have sparked increased recognition of cases across the globe. Whilst these patients tend to have a tumultuous course, much like sporadic CAA, there is a high degree of variability. What is unique in this case is the breadth of clinicoradiological data available, including handwritten surgical notes from 1985. In retrospect, early imaging changes of what would ultimately lead to profound morbidity, were apparent 30 years after inoculation with cadaveric dural tissue. In this case study we examine the clinicoradiological features of a case of probable iCAA and draw awareness to the presence of this disease in Australia. This case was admitted under the care of the author at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH). Clinical details and data were gathered during the patient's care and consent for publication provided by the enduring power of attorney. This 56-year-old female presented in 2018 with left hemiparesis, neglect, and dysarthria secondary to a large right frontal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) without an underlying macrovascular cause. MRI brain demonstrated diffuse superficial siderosis assumed related to previous surgical interventions during the mid-1980s for a Chiari malformation and cervical syrinx. There was evidence of extensive white matter disease, discordant with her lack of cerebrovascular disease risk factors. Brain biopsy confirmed CAA. Archived surgical notes confirmed exposure to Lyodura in 1985 and 1986. Two decades of MRI data were available for review and illustrate the evolution of CAA, from normal post-operative findings to marked and unrecognized abnormalities 4 years prior to her first ICH. This is the first Australian case of probable iatrogenic CAA (iCAA) to have such extensive documentation of clinicoradiological evolution. It demonstrates the aggressive course iCAA can take and provides insights into early disease manifestations, relevant to the more common sporadic cases. A brief review of the history of commercial cadaveric tissue use in Australia highlights enormous changes in medical practice over the last 50 years. Awareness within Australia should be raised for this clinical phenomenon, and cases collated to contribute to the growing international pool of evidence.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in neuroscience,10.3389/fnins.2023.1185267,PMC10196053,Lyodura; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; hemorrhagic stroke; iatrogenic cerebral amyloid angiopathy; intracerebral hemorrhage,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

The condition is classified into ventral and dorsal types. Clinical presentation of ventral simultanagnosia includes a reduced ability to recognize multiple visual stimuli rapidly, that is, part-by-part recognition. Here, we report a case of ventral simultanagnosia with a unique presentation; when short-duration visual stimuli were presented, the patient could perform global recognition by improving his part-by-part approach. To investigate the relationship between local and global perception bias and the duration of the present stimulus, we conducted a visual perception test using hierarchically organized Navon figures. The patient was a 62-year-old right-handed man who suffered from cerebral infarction in the right occipitotemporal lobe. He had no language dysfunction but exhibited left unilateral neglect, prosopagnosia, and ventral-type simultanagnosia. We conducted a visual perception test using the Navon figures and control figures as a visual stimulus. We randomly presented the figures for intervals of 0.2 or 20 s and let the patient report all the letters (global and/or local element) that he recognized. Global elements of the Navon letter were recognized a rate of 0% and 78.3% at intervals of 20 and 0.2 s, respectively, indicating that shorter presentation made the part-by-part approach less likely to manifest.

However, it was recently reported that cases of an unknown hidden aneurysm in AIS patients with large-vessel occlusion are rare. We report a rare case of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using a stent retriever for AIS. A 46-year-old patient with the right internal carotid artery terminal occlusion presented with the left-sided hemiparesis, hemispatial neglect, and dysarthria and underwent MT. Initial thrombectomy using a stent retriever and reperfusion catheter was unsuccessful. Angiography just before the second attempt showed SAH. Fortunately, we achieved recanalization of the thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b and hemostasis by lowering the blood pressure followed by coil embolization of the ruptured aneurysm. Only a few cases of ruptured aneurysms have been reported during MT using a stent retriever. Stent withdrawal is suspected to cause aneurysm rupture in cases with an unknown hidden middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm. Preinterventional detection of a hidden aneurysm is difficult. Therefore, surgeons must always consider the possibility of a hidden aneurysm rupture in vessels distal to the occlusion site and make adequate preparations for the prompt treatment of ruptured aneurysms after MT.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_789_2020,PMC7771481,Aneurysm; Ischemic stroke; Stent retriever; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Thrombectomy,Case Reports,United States,eng

The present research aimed to study neglect in situations where attentional resources are limited due to multitasking. We examined two patients more than 3 years after a right-hemispheric stroke. Both had received neuropsychological rehabilitation for left neglect and did not show any impairment in standard tests. We used a dual-task paradigm combining a peripheral target detection task with a central shape recognition task. Peripheral targets could appear in left/right positions but also in lower/upper positions. In patient #1, dual-task condition exacerbated left neglect and extinction. Patient #2 did not show any sign of neglect along the horizontal axis, but omitted half of the lower targets when they were presented simultaneously with upper targets under dual-task condition. This behavior reflects altitudinal extinction as the detection of single targets appearing either in upper or lower position was preserved. The present findings show that dual-tasking is a sensitive tool for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of spatial attention deficits, which are often overlooked by standard methods, especially in chronic stage.

Nonetheless, clinical documentation and understanding of motivationally based deficits of spatial orienting in the human is limited. Here in a series of one group-study and two single-case studies, we have examined right brain damaged patients (RBD) with and without left spatial neglect in a spatial reward-learning task, in which the motivational valence of the left contralesional and the right ipsilesional space was contrasted. In each trial two visual boxes were presented, one to the left and one to the right of central fixation. In one session monetary rewards were released more frequently in the box on the left side (75% of trials) whereas in another session they were released more frequently on the right side. In each trial patients were required to: 1) point to each one of the two boxes; 2) choose one of the boxes for obtaining monetary reward; 3) report explicitly the position of reward and whether this position matched or not the original choice. Despite defective spontaneous allocation of attention toward the contralesional space, RBD patients with left spatial neglect showed preserved contralesional reward learning, i.e., comparable to ipsilesional learning and to reward learning displayed by patients without neglect. A notable exception in the group of neglect patients was L.R., who showed no sign of contralesional reward learning in a series of 120 consecutive trials despite being able of reaching learning criterion in only 20 trials in the ipsilesional space. L.R. suffered a cortical-subcortical brain damage affecting the anterior components of the parietal-frontal attentional network and, compared with all other neglect and non-neglect patients, had additional lesion involvement of the medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and of the adjacent sectors of the corpus callosum. In contrast to his lateralized motivational learning deficit, L.R. had no lateral bias in the early phases of attentional processing as he suffered no contralesional visual or auditory extinction on double simultaneous tachistoscopic and dichotic stimulation and detected, with no exception, single contralesional visual and auditory stimuli. In a separate study, we were able to compare L.R. with another RBD patient, G.P., who had a selective lesion in the right ACC, in the adjacent callosal connections and the medial-basal prefrontal cortex. G.P. had no contralesional neglect and displayed normal reward learning both in the left and right side of space. These findings show that contralesional reward learning is generally preserved in RBD patients with left spatial neglect and that this can be exploited in rehabilitation protocols. Contralesional reward learning is severely disrupted in neglect patients when an additional lesion of the ACC is present: however, as demonstrated by the comparison between L.R. and G.P. cases, selective unilateral lesion of the right ACC does not produce motivational neglect for the contralesional space.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.008,,Cingulate cortex; Learning; Reward; Right brain damage; Spatial neglect,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

11287368,Two types of auditory neglect.,"Bellmann, A; Meuli, R; Clarke, S",Bellmann,"Auditory neglect, defined as inattention to stimuli within the left hemispace, is mostly reported in association with left ear extinction in dichotic listening. However, it remains disputed as to how far dichotic extinction reflects a primary attentional deficit and is thus appropriate for the diagnosis of auditory neglect. We report here on four patients who presented left ear extinction in dichotic listening following right unilateral hemispheric lesions. Auditory spatial attention was assessed with two additional tasks: (i) diotic test by means of interaural time differences (ITDs), simulating bilateral simultaneous spatial presentation of the dichotic tasks without the inconvenience of interaural intensity or content difference; and (ii) sound localization. A hemispatial asymmetry on the ITD diotic test or a spatial bias on sound localization were found to be part of auditory neglect. Two patients (J.C.N. and M.B.) presented a marked hemispatial asymmetry favouring the ipsilesional hemispace in the ITD diotic test, but did not show any spatial bias in sound localization. Two other patients (A.J. and E.S.) had the reverse profile: no hemispatial asymmetry in the ITD diotic test, but a severe spatial bias directed to the ipsilesional side in sound localization. J.C.N. and M.B. had mainly subcortical lesions affecting the basal ganglia. A.J. and E.S. had cortical lesions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal areas. Thus, there are two behaviourally and anatomically distinct types of auditory neglect characterized by: (i) deficit in allocation of auditory spatial attention following lesions centred on basal ganglia; or (ii) distortion of auditory spatial representation following frontotemporoparietal lesions.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.4.676,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report a patient with a neoplasm occupying the right ventral post-central gyrus and anterior supramarginal gyrus. The patient was admitted preoperatively with dissociation on the performance of neglect tasks, showing clinical deficits in the line bisection task and clock drawing, but not on the cancelation task. The patient underwent an awake craniotomy for tumor excision. Intraoperative visuospatial mapping was employed by applying direct electrical stimulation (DES) to the supramarginal gyrus and the ventral branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III) during the line bisection task. According to our findings, DES was ineffective at the cortical level, but it induced strong rightward bias when applied subcortically at the SLF III. By combining our preoperative and intraoperative anatomical and clinical data, we suggest that the posterior part of the SLF III might have a distinct role in the perceptual component of neglect. Our findings are discussed within the context of previous literature supporting the notion that particular behavioral features of spatial neglect are mediated by different white-matter connections.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2021.1984538,,Awake craniotomy; cancelation task; line bisection; neglect; tumor; white matter,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In keeping with the evidence, pathological rightward deviations in the bisection of number intervals due to right brain damage are generally interpreted as originating from a purely spatial-attentional deficit in the processing of the left side of number intervals. However, consistent double dissociations between defective processing of the left side of physical and mental number space have called into question the universality of this interpretation. Recent evidence suggests a link between rightward deviations in number space and defective memory for both spatial and non-spatial sequences of items. Here we describe the case of a left brain-damaged patient exhibiting right-sided neglect for extrapersonal and representational space, and left-sided neglect on the mental number line. Accurate neuropsychological examination revealed that the apparent left-sided neglect in the bisection of number intervals had a purely non-spatial origin and was based on mnemonic difficulties for the initial items of verbal sequences presented visually at an identical spatial position. These findings show that effective position-based verbal working memory might be crucial for numerical tasks that are usually considered to involve purely spatial representation of numerical magnitudes.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.005,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Her surgery and initial postoperative course were uncomplicated, but she presented with acute left hemiparesis, dysarthria, headache and vomiting on post-op day 29 secondary to vasospasm of M2. She was initially stabilized with intra-arterial verapamil then managed with volume expansion, permissive hypertension, and nimodipine. She developed recurrent vasospasm of M2 the following day and was again treated with intra-arterial verapamil. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed an infarction involving the right basal ganglia, frontal lobe, and parietal lobe and her hospital course was complicated by super-refractory status epilepticus. At her follow up appointment she displayed continued left lower extremity weakness, left visual field defect, and left-sided neglect. Overall, cerebral vasospasms associated with unruptured aneurysms remain rare complications and are not often monitored for after initial recovery. Reviewing the documented cases highlights the unpredictability of when these events occur with our current knowledge. Current hypotheses for the mechanisms responsible for delayed and refractory vasospasms include: blood-derived breakdown products, mechanically induced vasospastic responses, and delayed reactions from the trigemino-cerebrovascular system (TCVS). The uncertainly of these events warrants further research and supports a strong argument for monitoring patients with initial surgical clipping up to a month out from their initial procedure.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01925-8,PMC7488665,Aneurysmal clipping; Case report; Cerebral vasospasm; Unruptured intracranial aneurysms,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
25988538,An Intracranial Petri Dish? Formation of Abscess in Prior Large Stroke After Decompressive Hemicraniectomy.,"Wang, Jieqi; Fraser, Justin F",Wang,"Development of brain abscess after an infarction is a rare clinical condition. There have been 11 cases in the literature. Many patients were treated with potent antibiotics only and did not survive. We present 2 cases in which patients received aggressive surgical resection of brain abscess and survived. The analysis of the literature confirmed our finding that surgical intervention of brain abscess in patients after stroke is advisable. A 58-year-old man was transferred to our institution with left hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, neglect, and hemianopsia. The computed tomography angiography demonstrated large volume right hemispheric infarct. He underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy but developed fevers and swollen fontanelle 6 weeks later, which did not improve with antibiotics. The magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated progression of ring-enhancement of the old infarct and abscess formation was suspected. In another case, a 42-year-old woman was admitted to our institution with aphasia and weakness on the right side. The computed tomography angiography showed left middle cerebral artery territory infarction and decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed. Patient recovered well but a brain abscess was suspected during a routine preoperative computed tomography before cranioplasty. In the first case, patient was then taken to the operating room for resection of the infarcted brain tissue involved. The patient's consciousness improved, and he was discharged with antibiotic treatment. The patient subsequently underwent cranioplasty with synthetic graft with no complications. In the second case, the suspected abscess was resected surgically and culture of abscess grew Pantoea agglomerans and Bacillus macerans. The patient underwent synthetic cranioplasty 1 month later and remained in good condition. Secondary abscess formation after significant ischemic stroke is a rare condition that carries potential for high morbidity/mortality. The limited body of literature with the addition of our 2 cases supports aggressive management with surgical evacuation of brain abscess to increase survival.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2015.05.013,,Decompressive hemicraniectomy; Intracranial abscess; Ischemic stroke; Secondary infection; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

24227740,Role of somatosensory cortex in visuospatial attention.,"Balslev, Daniela; Odoj, Bartholomäus; Karnath, Hans-Otto",Balslev,"The human somatosensory cortex (S1) is not among the brain areas usually associated with visuospatial attention. However, such a function can be presumed, given the recently identified eye proprioceptive input to S1 and the established links between gaze and attention. Here we investigated a rare patient with a focal lesion of the right postcentral gyrus that interferes with the processing of eye proprioception without affecting the ability to locate visual objects relative to her body or to execute eye movements. As a behavioral measure of spatial attention, we recorded fixation time during visual search and reaction time for visual discrimination in lateral displays. In contrast to a group of age-matched controls, the patient showed a gradient in looking time and in visual sensitivity toward the midline. Because an attention bias in the opposite direction, toward the ipsilesional space, occurs in patients with spatial neglect, in a second study, we asked whether the incidental coinjury of S1 together with the neglect-typical perisylvian lesion leads to a milder neglect. A voxelwise lesion behavior mapping analysis of a group of right-hemisphere stroke patients supported this hypothesis. The effect of an isolated S1 lesion on visual exploration and visual sensitivity as well as the modulatory role of S1 in spatial neglect suggest a role of this area in visuospatial attention. We hypothesize that the proprioceptive gaze signal in S1, although playing only a minor role in locating visual objects relative to the body, affects the allocation of attention in the visual space.",{},,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1112-13.2013,PMC6619751,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

However, accumulating evidence shows that neglect can also follow lesions of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) that do not directly affect this parietal-frontal network. Surgical studies in the monkeys have demonstrated that complete callosal resection combined with lesion of the right optic tract entirely deprives the right hemisphere of visual inputs from the left hemispace provoking severe left unilateral neglect. Here, through the detailed study of two patients we show, for the first time, that PCA lesions selectively affecting the splenium of the corpus callosum and the adjacent right primary visual cortex provoke severe neglect selectively restricted to the visual domain. No trace of personal, motor or representational-imagery neglect was found. Also at variance with previous case studies in which neglect followed lesion of the trunk or the genu of the corpus callosum, no restriction of neglect to tasks performed with the right hand, no left hemispatial limb akinesia, no tactile extinction for the left hand and no tactile anomia for stimuli explored with the left hand were observed. These findings demonstrate that brain lesions depriving intact parietal and frontal attentional areas from specific sensory inputs can yield spatial neglect limited to specific sensory modalities or sectors of space.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-010-2230-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Neglect hampers rehabilitation progress and is associated with reduced quality of life. However, existing treatment methods show limited efficacy. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique, which can be used to increase or decrease brain excitability. Its combination with conventional neglect therapy may enhance treatment efficacy. A 72-year-old male with a subacute ischemic stroke of the right posterior cerebral artery suffering from visuospatial neglect, hemianopia, and hemiparesis was treated with biparietal tDCS and cognitive neglect therapy in a double-blind, sham-controlled single-case study. Four weeks of daily treatment sessions (5 days per week, 30 min) were started 26 days post-stroke. During week 1 and 4 the patient received conventional neglect therapy, during week 2, conventional neglect therapy was combined once with sham and once with real biparietal tDCS. Week 3 consisted of daily sessions of real biparietal tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) combined with neglect therapy. Outcome measures were assessed before, immediately after, as well as 1 week and 3 months after the end of treatment. They included subtests of the Test for Attentional Performance (TAP): covert attention (main outcome), alertness, visual field; the Neglect-Test (NET): line bisection, cancelation, copying; and activities of daily living (ADL). After real stimulation, covert attention allocation toward left-sided invalid stimuli was significantly improved, and line bisection and copying improved qualitatively as compared to sham stimulation. ADL were only improved at the 3-month follow-up. This single-case study demonstrates for the first time that combined application of tDCS and cognitive training may enhance training-induced improvements in measures of visuospatial neglect and is applicable in a clinical context.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,10.3389/fnsys.2014.00180,PMC4179329,cognitive therapy; rehabilitation; stroke; transcranial direct current stimulation; visuospatial neglect,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Although neglect has been observed following damage to a variety of brain structures, to date no reports exist of neglect phenomena arising from Huntington's Disease (HD). However, reports in the animal and human literature suggest that neglect is possible following damage to a primary site for Huntington's pathology, the basal ganglia. Here we present a patient (BG) with genetically proven HD who, in the context of the mild intellectual, executive and attentional impairments associated with the disorder, showed a remarkably severe and stable neglect for left space. MRI and electrophysiological results make it unlikely that the spatial bias could be accounted for by basic sensory loss. In addition, behavioural investigation indicated that, although BG's neglect operated in a very striking manner along body-centred co-ordinates (missing almost all information presented to her left), more general limitations in visual attention were apparent to the left-side of information presented entirely to the right of the body midline. Further evidence is presented showing that the neglect was manifest on tactile and auditory tasks as well as those presented in the visual domain. The presence of neglect in HD in this case is novel and somewhat puzzling, particularly as flourodeoyglucose positron emission tomography revealed bilateral caudate hypoperfusion. Reducing the statistical threshold on this analysis revealed a potential frontal hypometabolism that was more marked in the right than left hemisphere. However, as this was only apparent at a threshold below that normally considered acceptable (due to the resulting number of false positives), this possible account of the neglect must be viewed very cautiously.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.3.261.15559,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Dysesthesia, an unpleasant sensory disturbance, is common following thalamic stroke and evidence-based interventions for this impairment are limited. The purpose of this case report was to describe a decrease in dysesthesia following manual therapy intervention in a patient with history of right lacunar thalamic stroke. <b>Case description:</b> A 66-year-old female presented with tingling and dysesthesia in left hemisensory distribution including left trunk and upper/lower extremities, limiting function. Decreased left shoulder active range of motion, positive sensory symptoms but no sensory loss in light touch was found. She denied pain and moderate shoulder muscular weakness was demonstrated. Laterality testing revealed right/left limb discrimination deficits and neglect-like symptoms were reported. Passive accessory joint motion assessment of glenohumeral and thoracic spine revealed hypomobility and provoked dysesthesia. Interventions included passive oscillatory joint mobilization of glenohumeral joint, thoracic spine, ribs and shoulder strengthening. <b>Results:</b> After six sessions, shoulder function, active range of motion, strength improved and dysesthesia decreased. Global Rating of Change Scale was +5 and QuickDASH score decreased from 45% to 22% disability. Laterality testing was unchanged. <b>Conclusion:</b> Manual therapy may be a beneficial intervention in management of thalamic stroke-related dysesthesia. Implications for Rehabilitation While pain is common following thalamic stroke, patients may present with chronic paresthesia or dysesthesia, often in a hemisensory distribution. Passive movement may promote inhibition of hyperexcitable cortical pathways, which may diminish aberrant sensations.

The deficits associated with ipsilesional neglect have not been as well characterized. Because cueing may be used as a rehabilitative assistive device, we wanted to learn whether the efficacy of an attentional or intentional cue was related to the type of bias. We studied a patient with a right frontotemporal stroke who had ipsilesional neglect by using a video apparatus that dissociates sensory-attentional and motor-intentional systems. We also performed a cueing experiment with primarily sensory-attentional cues (i.e., read the letter at the end of the line) and primarily motor-intentional cues (i.e., touch the end of the line). Ipsilesional neglect was primarily a motor-intentional deficit with a motor-action bias to the left and a secondary sensory-attentional bias for stimuli to the right. With cueing we found a double dissociation: the rightwards motor-intentional cue improved the primary left-sided intentional bias and the leftwards sensory-attentional cue improved the secondary right-sided attentional bias.

A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for conservative treatment of hemiparesis and USN caused by stroke. He was previously diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to middle cerebral artery occlusion. His main symptoms were hemiparesis, egocentric spatial neglect in personal space and peripersonal space, and allocentric neglect, which made it difficult to use tools for daily living. Within 24 h of admission, perceptive exploration activities were initiated as the main therapy in addition to preparatory therapies, such as the facilitation of selective movement of limbs affected by paralysis. These therapies were provided over a 30-day period in 40-min sessions, 5 days a week. This treatment resulted in improved test results for the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Bisiach's body neglect and anosognosia scales, and the Behavioral Inattention Test. The Functional Independence Measure scores also improved with the improvement of neglect symptoms.

Preoperative DSA is mainly performed to obtain embolization of the lesion, although a number of complications have been reported after this procedure. Nonetheless, the coexistence of meningiomas with vascular malformations has previously been reported and it has been evidenced that this event could be underestimated because of neglect of preoperative DSA. Here, we report on two challenging cases of giant meningiomas associated to vascular malformations and we discuss the pertinent literature. In the first case: A large right temporal meningioma with erosion of the sphenoid greater wing and extension toward infratemporal fossa and right orbit - a large pseudoaneurysm of right middle cerebral artery branch was found end embolized during DSA. In the second case: A giant parieto-temporal meningioma - DSA permitted the full visualization of an abnormal drainage of superior sagittal sinus like a ""sinus pericranii"" that was respected during the following surgery. We think that MRI angiography is the exam of choice to study vascular anatomy in meningiomas. Nonetheless, DSA remains a useful tool in giant meningiomas not only to embolizate the lesion but also to treat tumor associated vascular malformation and to achieve the full knowledge of vascular anatomy.

We studied two right-brain-damaged patients with lesions sparing the occipital lobe and a mild left neglect on target cancellation or line bisection. The lesions involved the temporoparietal region (Patient 1) and the basal ganglia and the insula (Patients 1 and 2). Patients were given drawing tasks and tasks requiring perceptual and visuomotor judgments of horizontal extent. In drawing objects such as a daisy both from memory and by copying, patients exhibited a disproportionate enlargement of the left-hand side of objects and added more left-sided petals to the drawn daisy. This pathologic behavior persisted when the patients were blindfolded and was likely to reflect a perceptual, rather than premotor, size distortion. In a task requiring the perceptual matching of two rectangles, patients underestimated the left-sided stimulus. In a visuomotor task requiring the reproduction of the horizontal extent of a segment, patients exhibited a hyperextension, when a leftward movement was required. We showed a disordered representation of extrapersonal space, possibly involving a contralesional relaxation of the spatial medium.

The rare exceptions to these rules provide important clues as to what functions co-lateralise, and are thus crucial for models of cerebral specialization. Here we report on the case of a patient, who, after a lesion restricted to the left thalamic region, showed signs normally associated with right hemispheric injury including motor impersistence, visuo-spatial dysfunction and poor comprehension of facial expression. Language abilities were spared and no signs of apraxia were present, in spite of his right hand, foot and eye preference, a pattern normally associated with conventional cerebral dominance. In spite of his other right hemispheric signs, the patient showed no signs of hemi-spatial neglect.

The onset is usually sudden, with moderate contralateral weakness. Sensory changes may be present but remain mild. The patients are apathetic, show perseveration and may be disoriented. In left-sided infarcts, transcortical aphasia, verbal and visual memory impairment and sometimes acalculia are found. In right-sided infarcts, hemispatial neglect, visual memory impairment and disturbed visuospatial processing are common. A decreased level of consciousness, disturbed ocular movements, severe motor weakness and delayed abnormal movements do not occur. Involvement of the ventral lateral and dorsomedial nucleus with sparing of the intralaminar nuclei, posterolateral formation and upper midbrain may explain this picture.

A clicker-based expansion mechanism allows incremental expansion of the retriever and step-wise increase in radial force to the parent vessel diameter. The clicker mechanism is used to expand the stent retriever until it is apposed with the vessel walls. Rest of the procedure is similar to a mechanical thrombectomy performed with a conventional stent retriever and is demonstrated in the video.

It has been argued that to a large extent these bisection errors can be attributed to a perceptual change whereby the patient experiences the left half of a line as shorter than the right half, causing them to set the midpoint of the line towards the right. We describe here a patient with a left hemisphere lesion and rightward neglect, who consequently makes bisection errors in a leftward direction. We carried out a series of tests which confirmed that he shows a subjective visual distortion in the converse direction, i.e. a perception of horizontal extents on the right as shorter than extents on the left. We also found that he shows a similar distortion in his tactile perception. The association of visual and tactile distortions in this patient is compatible with the view that the distortion effects have a rather high-level origin.

Furthermore, although she made rightward errors in bisecting far-distant lines, our patient made smaller opposite leftward errors for near-distant lines.

34740614,Attention upturned: Bias toward and away from the affected side of the body and near space in a case of complex regional pain syndrome.,"Halicka, Monika; Vittersø, Axel D; Proulx, Michael J; Bultitude, Janet H",Halicka,"People with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) following limb injury can show neuropsychological symptoms in the absence of observable brain pathologies. These can include sensory changes, distorted body representation, and inattention to their affected limb and its surrounding space, resembling post-stroke hemispatial neglect. The precise nature and mechanisms of these neuropsychological symptoms are unclear, however insights could be gained by testing for dissociations and associations that have been observed in stroke patients. Drawing from clinical and experimental methods for investigating spatial attention bias and related symptoms in stroke patients, we conducted a detailed investigation of neuropsychological symptoms in a woman with CRPS of her left arm who initially presented to us with pronounced inattention to her affected side. The patient showed visual and tactile neglect and extinction on her affected side on confrontation tests, but no attention deficits on ""bedside"" tests of neglect. On sensitive computer-based measures, attention biases were found in the patient's body and near space (in Temporal Order Judgements), but not far or imagined space (on the Greyscales task and Mental Number Line Bisection). Unique to the current literature, the patient showed a reversal in her Temporal Order Judgement bias across time, from inattention (first and second session) to hyperattention (third session) to her affected side. In contrast, pain and self-reported body representation distortion were similar across the three sessions. The patient had reduced central and peripheral visual acuity, however these deficits were near symmetrical and therefore could not explain her performance on the visual attention tasks. Given that spatial attention bias has been linked to imbalance in relative activation of the two cerebral hemispheres, we administered a Global-Local processing task to test for hemispheric asymmetry. This revealed no difference in global compared to local interference refuting any hemispheric imbalance. Instead, the patient showed impaired performance (compared to controls) on incongruent trials regardless of trial type, consistent with executive impairment. We conclude that spatial attention bias in CRPS can generalize across different sensory modalities and extend beyond the affected limb to the external space around it, independent of any low-level sensory disturbances. This bias is not necessarily directed away from the affected side or stable over time. People with CRPS can also demonstrate more generalized neuropsychological changes in sensory and executive functions. Our observations refute several existing theories about the mechanisms of attention bias in CRPS, and their relationship to pain, and have potential implications for treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.108079,,Body representation; Complex regional pain syndrome; Hemispatial neglect; Spatial attention; Temporal order judgement,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Although mechanical thrombectomy transiently resulted in recanalization of the occluded lesion, restenosis immediately occurred and recurred repeatedly. On an angiogram, the stent retriever appeared poorly dilated at the stenosis and showed a contrast deficit. We concluded that restenosis was due to a secondary thrombus resulting from a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. The stent retriever was kept deployed for 15 minutes. After the stent was retrieved, restenosis did not occur.

11561029,Conflict and integration of spatial attention between disconnected hemispheres.,"Ishiai, S; Koyama, Y; Furuya, T",Ishiai,"To clarify how the disconnected hemispheres perceive a line and bisect it with successful or unsuccessful integration of spatial attention. Eye movements were recorded when a patient with an extensive callosa infarction bisected horizontal lines. The lesion extended into the left cingulate gyrus. When the patient bisected lines with the right hand, the gaze was initially directed rightward and shifted further to the right side with the execution of manual response, which resulted in rightward errors. Shortly after bisection, rapid ocular searches occurred to the left side, whereas the rightward errors did not decrease throughout the trials. When using the left hand, there was no deviation of the gaze before presentation of lines. In the first few trials, the patient bisected the line with a leftward error and then searched rapidly to the right side. The subsequent bisections were almost accurate, as the subjective midpoint was placed near the point of the initial fixation that fell around the true centre. Ocular searching was mostly absent during and after line bisection. In callosa disconnection, left unilateral spatial neglect may appear when use of the right hand induces a rightward bias in the attentional control of the left hemisphere and damage to its cingulate gyrus inhibits interhemispheric integration of attention. Resultant rightward errors of line bisection often cause interhemispheric conflict of attention, as the right hemisphere perceives the longer extent on the left side. By contrast, the disconnected but intact right hemisphere may bisect a line accurately by integrating attention to the extents perceived in the left and right visual fields.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.71.4.472,PMC1763536,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Case 1 experienced left hemispatial neglect and gait disorder due to right internal cerebral artery (ICA) occlusion and underlying atherosclerosis. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), revascularization with mild stenosis was achieved. Case 2 complained of reduced activity, motor aphasia, and right-sided hemiparesis due to left middle cerebral artery occlusion. After thrombectomy using a retrieval stent, revascularization with M1 stenosis and distal perfusion delay was observed, which improved after PTA. Case 3 arrived at our hospital 30 h after the onset of dysarthria and gait disturbance due to left ICA occlusion. Since the symptoms were mild, medical treatment was started; however, the patient's symptoms deteriorated 6 h later, and EVT was required. After thrombectomy using a retrieval stent, revascularization was achieved. LVO pathophysiology beyond 24 h of stroke onset varies and may require multimodal treatment. Preserving the pyramidal tract may lead to favorable outcomes, even in cases of anterior circulation LVO.

We adjusted multiple regression analyses and analysis of variance as well as post hoc regression and t tests for persistence in the repeated measures using variance-sample size analysis to estimate self-similarity, a measure related to the fractal correlation dimension. In each session, the patient's line bisections revealed transient leftward bias in her left peripersonal space, and constant rightward bias in her right peripersonal space. Her leftward bias shifted to a rightward bias over repeated trials in her left space. The patient's left-to-right shift with repeated trials suggests either fatigue from an attempted compensation for leftward inattention or habituation of a contralesional spatial attentional attraction, revealing contralesional left-sided neglect in both the left and right spaces.

Interest has grown in the cognitive consequences of insula neurosurgery and studies have largely shown postoperative stability or minor decline. Major or widespread improvements in cognitive functioning following resection of insular tumours have not previously been reported.<b>Case description:</b> A 34-year-old, left-handed man with a right insular low-grade glioma (LGG) presented with seizures, nausea, altered sensation, poor balance and extensive cognitive decline. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment highlighted a striking left hemispatial neglect and impairments in attention, working memory, verbal learning and fluency. During an awake craniotomy with functional cortical mapping, he reported intraoperative improvements in hand function and processing speed. Resolution of the neglect and significant improvements in cognition, mood and functioning were observed at follow-up and sustained over several years.<b>Conclusions:</b> This case highlights that right insular LGGs can cause significant cognitive and functional deficits and that neurosurgery has the potential to alleviate these difficulties to an extent beyond those documented in the extant literature.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,British journal of neurosurgery,10.1080/02688697.2020.1825620,,Awake craniotomy; brain tumours; cognitive function; neuropsychological function,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This patient's putaminal hemorrhage may have induced frontal dysfunction with an attentional grasp.

However, little has been reported about the neural tracts associated with egocentric and allocentric neglect. We investigated which neural tracts were involved in two types of neglect (egocentric and allocentric) in a stroke patient who showed allocentric neglect by using the Apple Cancellation test, a specialized test to distinguish between egocentric and allocentric neglect. He showed good cognitive function but presented with severe neglect on the left side (A 42-year-old, right-handed male patient). He was unable to undergo even the pencil and paper test for evaluation of the severity of neglect. He was diagnosed as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage at the right basal ganglia and underwent conservative management at the neurosurgery department of a university hospital. Two weeks after onset, he began rehabilitation at the rehabilitation department of the same university hospital. During a seven month rehabilitation, the patient showed significant improvement of his severe left neglect. We used the Apple Cancellation test to distinguish between egocentric and allocentric neglect; the results failed to reveal egocentric neglect, however, they did reveal severe allocentric neglect. In addition, on diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) at 2 weeks after onset, the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) showed partial injury and narrowing in the parietal lobe compared to that of the left SLF. In addition, the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was not reconstructed. By contrast, on 7-month post-onset DTT, the right SLF revealed elongation and thickening in the parietal lobe that approached similarity to that for the left SLF. However, the right IFOF was still not reconstructed. The associations of egocentric neglect with the dorsal pathway (SLF) and the association of allocentric neglect with the ventral pathway (IFOF) in the right hemisphere were demonstrated in a stroke patient.

17354375,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

2291035,[Hematoma of the head of the caudate nucleus].,"Pedrazzi, P; Bogousslavsky, J; Regli, F",Pedrazzi,"We studied five patients with cerebral hemorrhage limited to the head of the caudate nucleus. This rare localization represents 11% of central nuclei hemorrhages. This entity has various clinical expressions; some are similar to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, others show the same manifestations associated with hemiparesis and neuropsychological findings, while still in others, the neuropsychological syndrome with speech, behaviour or memory disturbances predominates. Recovery depends on the patient's previous clinical status and on the presence of associated lesions at the time of hemorrhage. Typical warning signs, like headache, are often absent in the elderly and debilitated. Meningismus is explained by the intraventricular extension of the hemorrhage. Motor deficit, usually moderate, is probably due to impairment of the anterior portion of the posterior arm of the internal capsule. Destruction of the head of the left caudate nucleus, which is part of the circuit causing ""subcortical aphasias"", is responsible for non specific speech disturbances, that are however remarkably rich in semantic paraphasias. These dysfunctions could be caused by a ""cortical diaschisis"" as suggested by SPECT analysis. Memory dysfunction as a result of caudate lesion is questioned. However confusion and behavioural disturbances, like preservations, transitory mutism and self neglect, seem characteristic. As shown by cerebral blood flow (CBF) studies, these disturbances might represent a frontal dysfunction caused by the interruption of the dorso-latero-prefrontal and orbito-frontal circuits. When the hemorrhage extends beyond the head of the caudate nucleus, behavioural changes occur due to the involvement of neighbouring structures such as the thalamus, internal capsule, temporal lobe and nucleus accumbens. Caudate hemorrhages occur mostly in the elderly, often with long-standing arterial hypertension causing lesions of the lenticulo-striate arteries. Severe stenosis or complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with a fragile anastomotic circuit or angiopathies in younger individuals (particularly Asiatics: moyamoya disease) are less frequent, but they should be considered and investigated by arteriography.

It is unknown, however, whether these two frames are represented independently in the brain and if so, which areas (or networks) of the brain are responsible for each frame of reference. To determine whether body-centered neglect and stimulus-centered neglect can be dissociated in patients with brain injury. New figure discriminative cancellation tasks were designed to simultaneously assess body-centered neglect and stimulus-centered neglect. Two neglect patients with lesions located in different anatomic regions were required to circle every complete figure and to cross out every figure with a missing portion on a sheet of white (29.7 x 42 cm) paper. Patient 1 omitted leftward stimuli on the paper, but the stimuli he found were correctly circled or crossed out. On the other hand, Patient 2 marked stimuli across the paper although he mistakenly circled stimuli that were missing a portion of their left side. Neither patient manifested interaction between the two types of neglect. The results of this study clearly showed double dissociation between the two types of neglect.

One might think this report would assure Gage a permanent place in the annals of neurology, but this was not the case. There was a good reason for this neglect: hardly anyone knew about Harlow's 1868 report. Dr. David Ferrier, an early proponent of the localisation of cerebral function, rescued Gage from obscurity and used the case as the highlight of his famous 1878 Goulstonian lectures. Gage had, through a tragic natural experiment, provided proof of what Ferrier's studies showed: the pre-frontal cortex was not a ""non-functional"" brain area. A rod going through the prefrontal cortex of Phineas Gage signalled the beginning of the quest to understand the enigmas of this fascinating region of the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,"Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)",10.1016/j.nrl.2010.07.015,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Historical Article; Journal Article,Spain,spa

23560431,Assessment and functional impact of allocentric neglect: a reminder from a case study.,"Shah, Priyanka P; Spaldo, Nicole; Barrett, A M; Chen, Peii",Shah,"SR suffered a right hemispheric stroke more than 3 years ago, and now lives with left-sided hemiparesis and chronic spatial neglect due to damaged white matter pathways connecting the frontal, temporal and parietal regions. We report here that SR suffers from both viewer-centered (i.e., egocentric) and object-centered (i.e., allocentric) spatial neglect. Notably, unlike most neuropsychological and functional assessments that focus on egocentric deficits, a specialized neuropsychological figurative discrimination test (the Apples test) revealed SR's allocentric neglect. Further, using assessments sensitive to detect functional deficits related to allocentric neglect, we observed SR's difficulty in reading and using clocks, reflecting his object-centered errors in these everyday activities. SR's case suggests that allocentric-specific assessments, both neuropsychological and functional, are valuable in standard neglect examinations, particularly to predict daily function after stroke. We recommend that neglect-related functional disability be distinguished further with respect to allocentric spatial deficits, and functional assessments for allocentric neglect should be validated in future large sample studies. Identifying allocentric neglect early, and learning about its influence on daily function, may enhance care quality and facilitate effective rehabilitation planning for stroke recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1080/13854046.2013.783120,PMC3759518,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

At the time of testing, the patient had a complete left visual field deficit but only a very slight left hemiparesis. Under conventional testing conditions, line bisection performed with the right hand showed more severe left neglect than when performed with the left hand. This pattern of performance could, however, be modified, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by changing the starting position of the patient's hand when bisecting horizontal lines. The results suggest that spatio-motor cueing has a more profound effect upon task performance than does differential hemispheric activation per se. We also provide a demonstration that, in a normal subject, the starting position of the hand is likewise a crucial determinant of task performance. In this case, however, there is also an interaction between the hand (and hence hemisphere) deployed and the position of that hand in space.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(91)90018-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

USN is usually caused by lesion of the right parietal lobe: nowadays, it is also clear the key role of structural connections (the second and the third branch of the right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus, respectively, SLF II and III) and functional networks (Dorsal and Ventral Attention Network, respectively, DAN and VAN) in USN. In this multimodal case report, we have merged those structural and functional information derived from a patient with a right parietal lobe tumour and USN before surgery. Functional, structural and neuropsychological data were also collected 6 months after surgery, when the USN was spontaneously recovered. Diffusion metrics and Functional Connectivity (FC) of the right SLF and DAN, before and after surgery, were compared with the same data of a patient with a tumour in a similar location, but without USN, and with a control sample. Results indicate an impairment in the right SLF III and a reduction of FC of the right DAN in patients with USN before surgery compared to controls; after surgery, when USN was recovered, patient's diffusion metrics and FC showed no differences compared to the controls. This single case and its multimodal approach reinforce the crucial role of the right SLF III and DAN in the development and recovery of egocentric and allocentric extra-personal USN, highlighting the need to preserve these structural and functional areas during brain surgery.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1111/jnp.12339,,DAN; SLF; brain surgery; diffusion; functional connectivity; rs‐fMRI; tractography; unilateral spatial neglect,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Furthermore, the restricted number of reports and the lack of uniform clinical assessment of affected individuals did not allow to define more in depth the clinical features and the underlying neural correlates of these uncommon clinical disorders. Here we report an 89-years old woman with a right hemispheric lesion who showed a contralesional defect of eyelid closure. We also include a video neuroimage of this case and a review of eyelid closing and opening disorders in patients with focal unilateral lesions. In this review we found a correlation between right hemisphere and eyelid motor control, particularly for apraxia of eyelid closure affecting only the contralesional eye. The right parietal lobe was most frequently affected in this unilateral form of eyelid closing disorders, whereas putamen and other subcortical structures were more involved in eyelid opening than in eyelid closing disorders.

When such errors affect the left sides of words, they are usually produced by patients with focal right hemisphere lesions who typically show evidence of left neglect in non-reading tasks. This pattern has thus been termed ""neglect dyslexia"". When the right sides of words are affected, however, patients frequently fail to show any signs of neglect in tasks other than reading. This study presents results from a patient with left hemisphere damage, and a very clear pattern of right ""neglect"" errors in reading, on a series of tasks testing attentional and imagery processes. Given the magnitude and consistency of the patient's reading errors, there was little evidence that these errors resulted from inattention to the right side of space or to the right side of an internally generated visual image.

The line bisection task was used in both patients but with different criteria. In the first case, the authors respected any area, even within the tumor, where significant interference was found (a stimulation-induced error in 2 of 3 applications defined an essential area). In the second case, they removed 1 essential area located in the tumor and recorded an uneventful clinical response soon thereafter. They continued to monitor the patient without stimulation and stopped the resection when the patient was close to the criteria valid for defining spatial neglect. The signs of spatial neglect were present for 3 days postoperatively and then cleared spontaneously. Subtotal tumor removal was achieved in both cases. Evidence in the present study reveals that areas for visuospatial functions cannot be assessed with the same criteria used for language functions, since essential areas located in the tumor can be safely removed.",{},,Neurosurgical focus,10.3171/2012.12.FOCUS12358,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The 2018 AHA guidelines have recommended not to perform excessive time-consuming imaging before rt-PA. Here we describe two cases in which reperfusion therapy was decided based on advanced imaging. The first case was a 70-year-old woman with complaints of total aphasia and right unilateral spatial neglect. Her MRI revealed no apparent high signal area in diffusion-weighted image (DWI), and her magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no large vessel occlusion. Subsequent perfusion-weighted image (PWI) analysis showed a unilateral perfusion deficit in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) region. The other case was an 88-year-old man with complaints of minor unilateral spatial neglect, right conjugate deviation of the eyes, and dysarthria. His MRI also revealed no apparent high signal area in DWI, and MRA showed slight stenosis in the right middle MCA. Subsequent PWI analysis showed a unilateral perfusion deficit in the right MCA region. In both cases, intravenous rt-PA therapy was administered after the diagnosis of AIS and the patients responded well to the reperfusion therapy. When DWI is performed too early, detecting the ischemic core and differentiating between a diagnosis of stroke and stroke mimics is sometimes difficult. Evaluation of perfusion abnormalities in acute cases can be performed quickly, as shown in these cases. Although rt-PA can be given just by non-contrast CT with no hemorrhage, advanced imaging may be an option to identify difficult-to-diagnose patients who require reperfusion therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000501547,PMC6738249,Acute ischemic stroke; Diffusion-weighted image-perfusion-weighted image mismatch; Diffusion-weighted imaging-negative acute ischemic stroke; Magnetic resonance perfusion; Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

In a series of five experiments, we show that R.B. has a selective inability to analyse and copy accurately the left contours of geometric nonsense-figures. These results hold even when there is a single vertical contour (to be copied) that divides a rectangle or a circle into two sub-figures; this physically-identical boundary is copied more accurately when it is cued as the right edge of the left sub-figure than when it is cued as the left edge of the right sub-figure. These effects are not influenced by a manipulation in which R.B. is required to trace the outline of the relevant sub-figure with his finger immediately prior to drawing his copy. The results are interpreted in terms of classical Gestalt theories of figure-ground assignment.

Her CT-Angiogram showed a large occlusive thrombus within the right M1-M2 segments. During pregnancy she had developed thrombocytopenia. There was initial treatment decision dilemma. In view of her history of thrombocytopenia, there was concern about administering rtPA due to the risk of bleeding. As the thrombus was large, rtPA may also be ineffective. MT was proposed by the Stroke Physician as the preferred treatment option. A concern from the Interventional-Radiologist was the risk of exposure to radiation and contrast agents. As the patient had a disabling stroke at a young age, decision was made to proceed with MT which started 141 minutes after symptom onset. The clot was aspirated without complications. Final check angiogram showed complete resolution of flow within the right middle cerebral artery territory. The patient underwent elective uncomplicated Caesarean-section 5 days later delivering a healthy new born. Severe stroke in pregnancy is rare, but has grave consequences for both mother and infant.

Affected individuals pay little or insufficient attention to the space contralateral to the injured cerebral hemisphere, often resulting in or exacerbating disability following an acquired brain injury. Eliminating visual input may increase attention toward the contralesional side of space, and improve symptoms of spatial neglect; however this has never been examined in a clinical setting. <b>Objective:</b> In this case report, we observed an individual demonstrate immediate and spontaneous postural changes once visual input was eliminated. <b>Methods:</b> The patient, a 53-year-old female, was admitted to a rehabilitation hospital after hemorrhagic stroke affecting her right basal ganglia and surrounding regions in the frontal lobe. She exhibited left-sided spasticity, severe right gaze preference, and stark rightward postural deviation. Neck passive range of motion was normal. Visual field integrity was inconclusive due to poor communication and impaired cognitive function. Contraversive pushing was ruled out. <b>Results:</b>Once visual input was eliminated by applying a blindfold, the patient turned to the left spontaneously, had more buttock contact on the left, and placed more weight toward the left side in a sitting posture. However, she returned to rightward deviation three minutes after blindfold removal. In addition, the patient's rehabilitation team reported that she was able to participate in more therapy activities with binocular occlusion than with eyes open. <b>Conclusion:</b> Binocular occlusion appeared to demonstrate an immediate, albeit transient, improvement in postural symmetry.

Two of the three patients, like reported cases with frontal neglect, showed a typical exploratory deficit for the left space in the line cancellation test.

Since these factors affect the perceptual configuration of stimuli, the modulation of extinction is believed to reflect low-level perceptual grouping. In the present study, patient AG did not show any modulation of contralesional detection when the ipsilesional and contralesional stimulus grouped by colour, by form, or both (Experiment 1). In contrast, identification of the contralesional stimulus was facilitated when the stimuli grouped (Experiment 2), suggesting a modulation of extinction by specific task demands. Experiment 3 used a cueing procedure to demonstrate modulation of extinction by expectation biases. Prior to stimulus presentation, AG was cued to attend to a particular feature (e.g. colour). After stimulus exposure he was prompted to identify the expected feature on valid trials and the unexpected feature on invalid trials. AG showed a significant validity effect for contralesional stimuli i.e. he identified the expected feature (e.g. colour) significantly better than the unexpected feature (e.g. form). These results suggest that competition for selection between visual stimuli may not only be influenced by perceptual characteristics of the display, but also by high-level factors such as the response criterion or expectation biases.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00134-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

CAA-I is an uncommon variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Keys to diagnosis rely on the physician's awareness of this entity, CMBs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an often favorable response to immunosuppression, and ultimately brain biopsy. CAA-I with no CMBs is rarely reported. A 76-year-old woman presented with 4 weeks of headaches and was found to have visual neglect on the left part of the visual field. MRI of the brain showed sulcal/gyriform hyperintensity with associated leptomeningeal enhancement in the right occipital lobe on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. No CMBs or large parenchymal FLAIR lesions were seen on MRI. Biopsy was consistent with CAA-I. The patient's headaches resolved spontaneously and no immunosuppression was initiated.

15505977,Impaired spatial working memory: one component of the visual neglect syndrome?,"Malhotra, Paresh; Mannan, Sabira; Driver, Jon; Husain, Masud",Malhotra,"Both impaired spatial working memory (SWM) and unilateral neglect may follow damage to the right parietal lobe. We propose that impaired SWM can exacerbate visual neglect, due to failures in remembering locations that have already been searched. When combined with an attentional bias to the ipsilesional right side, such a SWM impairment should induce recursive search of ipsilesional locations. Here we studied a left neglect patient with a right temporoparietal haemorrhage. On a nonlateralised, purely vertical SWM task, he was impaired in retaining spatial locations. In a visual search task, his eye position was monitored while his spatial memory was probed. He recursively searched through right stimuli, re-fixating previously inspected items, and critically treated them as if they were new discoveries, consistent with the SWM deficit. When his recovery was tracked over several months, his SWM deficit and left neglect showed concurrent improvements. We argue that impaired SWM may be one important component of the visual neglect syndrome.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70163-1,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

She presented to our emergency department with chief complaints of abnormal involuntary movements and a feeling of foreignness on her left upper limb. The first neurological examination revealed left spatial neglect, left-side sensory impairment that included superficial and deep sensations, left limb-kinetic apraxia, and left limb ataxia. Furthermore, her symptoms and complaints had characteristics of AHS that includes a sensation that her left upper limb dose not belong to herself and an abnormal behavior of left hand that is contrary to her own intent. Brain MRI revealed an acute cerebral infarction confined to the right postcentral gyrus. This case highlights that sensory ataxia due to the disturbance of deep sensation might present symptoms similar to AHS. Previous studies suggested the involvement of the disturbance of somatosensory pathway in posterior-variant AHS. Therefore, a precise distinction between AHS and sensory ataxia, especially in posterior-variant AHS, is imperative to avoid confusion regarding the term ""alien hand sign.""","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001101,,alien hand sign; cerebral infarction; parietal lobe; postcentral gyrus; sensory ataxia,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
8043269,The psychophysical power law and unilateral spatial neglect.,"Chatterjee, A; Mennemeier, M; Heilman, K M",Chatterjee,"The relationship between objective measures and subjective experiences of sensory stimuli is described by a power law, psi = K phi beta, in which psi represents the psychological value and phi the physical value. The constant (K) and the exponent (beta) are empirically derived. This relationship is often assumed to correspond to properties of peripheral receptor sensory transduction. Patients with left-sided spatial neglect tend to bisect lines to the right of the objective midline. Line bisection bias was used as the dependent variable in how a patient with neglect and five normal subjects bisected lines of varying lengths. Analyzing these data as a power function accounted for over 99% of the variance in five different experimental conditions. The normal exponent matched the value expected from traditional psychophysical experiments of line length estimation, whereas the patient's exponent was diminished. The patient's data provide evidence for central nervous system participation in computations underlying psychophysical relationships. The notion that attentional and perceptual processes are closely linked was supported by the influence of attentional cuing on the power functions obtained in normal subjects. The descriptive precision of the power function uncovered qualitative variability in how normal subjects allocate attention across different spatial reference frames and demonstrated that this patient had a quantitative defect in directing attention across an allosteric reference frame, but a qualitative defect in directing attention across a viewer/environment reference frame.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1994.1025,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

In the tactile domain, however, research on this topic is meagre and it is still uncertain whether processing of tactually presented stimuli can be affected by the same attentional disorders as visual stimuli. In this paper we describe a patient, ENM, with visual neglect and light touch extinction who, in a naming task of objects presented in the tactile modality, simultaneously to both hands, showed extinction for left hand objects. He was, nevertheless, able to make above chance Same/Different judgements on the two stimuli. We also tested two neurologically intact subjects who performed the test wearing a ski-glove on the left hand to impair the recognition of left hand objects. In these subjects, Same/Different judgements were at chance level when recognition rate was as low as that found in patient ENM. This happened when either the objects, although sharing the same name were different in shape (conditions Same-Different) or when the two objects were different with respect to the category name but were actually physically similar (conditions Different-Similar). However, when the objects were either identical or completely different, i.e., in a condition where judgement could be based simply on the physical analysis of the object shape (condition Same Identical and Different Dissimilar), their Same/Different judgements were above chance, despite the tactual deficit. Our conclusion was that patient ENM showed implicit recognition of left hand objects, at least in the Same Different and in the Different-Similar conditions, whereas, in the same conditions, normal subjects with an artificial sensory impairment did not. Our results also show that Same/Different judgements may be, in some conditions, less demanding than naming tasks, as suggested by Farah et al. Furthermore, patient ENM performed the test both with uncrossed and crossed hands. We found that extinction always affected the hand contralateral to the brain damage, although there was a tendency for a decrement of the ipsilesional hand performance in the crossed condition. We discuss these findings with reference to the most recent theories on the existence of a body centered spatial frame of reference.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(98)00077-3,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The present paper describes a 66-year-old male patient with a long history of schizophrenia, whose psychotic symptoms displayed qualitative and quantitative changes after a closed-head injury. After a very disturbed childhood and youth, including several jail terms, the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 1960s and frequently thereafter hospitalized. Visual hallucinations were the dominant symptom, and art therapy provided some relief, which led to a successful artistic career. In 1989, while actively hallucinating, he suffered a mild TBI in a pedestrian accident. Despite findings of organic dysfunction, he did not receive full neuropsychological diagnosis and treatment until four years later, when he presented with symptoms of perseveration, hemispatial neglect, and disturbances of working memory. The patient then received an individual program of neuropsychological rehabilitation, while his treating psychiatrist gradually withdrew psychotropic medication. After a year of therapy there was marked improvement of both neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms. At the same time, he began to paint in a completely different style. The case described here shows that the pathomechanisms of schizophrenia and neurobehavioral disturbances resulting from organic brain damage are not after all unrelated.

Frequently, DBS patients are multimorbid and managing them may be challenging, since postoperative complications can become more likely with age. In this article, we present two cases of myocardial infarction after DBS with different therapeutic strategies. Case 1 was anticoagulated with a heparin infusion with a target partial thromboplastine time (PTT) between 50 and 60 s after the myocardial infarction and showed 3 days later, after an initial postoperative inconspicuous cranial computer tomography, an intracerebral haematoma, which was evacuated without explanting the DBS lead. Case 2 was only treated with enoxaparine 40 mg s.c. twice a day after the myocardial infarction without any further complications. Both cases benefited from the DBS with respect to the motor fluctuations, but case 1 continued to suffer from psychomotor slowdown, mild hemiparesis of the left side, visual neglect and a gaze paresis. Unfortunately, there are no established guidelines or therapy recommendations for the management of such patients. An individual therapy regime is necessary for this patient population regarding the bleeding risk, the cardial risk and the symptoms of the patient. Retrospectively, the rejection of the intravenous application of heparin in case 2 seems to be the right decision. But regarding the small number of cases, it remains still an individual therapy. Further experience will help us to develop optimal therapy strategies for this patient population.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-013-1679-z,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,Austria,eng

Disinhibition, perseveration, and left hemispatial neglect, features of his cognitive profile were readily discernible in his work. The differences in his style are examined with respect to his main neuroanatomic abnormalities, namely right cerebral hemiatrophy as defined by magnetic resonance and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Cognitive deficits, including visuoconstructive and motor neglect, apathy, perseveration, and disinhibition as determined by neuropsychological testing, contributed to the dissolution of his artistic skills.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that neglect is frequently associated with brain damage including the primary site of WD, the basal ganglia.

The baseline evaluation demonstrated that KH had neglect dysgraphia with verbal stimuli (e.g., words or sentences) although her deficit was less evident in drawing multiple geometric shapes. Six months after the initial evaluation, KH showed evidence of neglect dysgraphia only when writing was associated with a secondary memory task. KHs writing performance is discussed with reference to previous cases of spatial neglect dysgraphia and in the context of spatial neglect.

Yet, quantitative tests for the diagnosis of nonvisual neglect are still quite rare. The purpose of the present paper was to develop and evaluate a novel, simple and sensitive test for the assessment of body representational neglect (BRN) in patients with left or right cerebral hemispheric lesions. The vest test covers the front part of the trunk. The blindfolded subject wears the vest and is instructed to pick up all objects from the 24 pockets of the vest (12 on each side) as quickly as possible using the ipsilesional, nonparetic hand. Two samples of healthy control subjects (each N=25) using either their left or their right hand performed the test in identical way to obtain normative data for patients searching with their left hand (i.e. left hemisphere stroke patients) versus their right hand (i.e. right hemisphere stroke patients). The test can be performed within 5~minutes, even with aphasic or apractic stroke patients. Psychometric evaluations in a sample of 50 patients with unilateral stroke (25 leftsided, 25 rightsided) show high objectivity, high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.96), good retest-reliability (0.79 after 1 week in neglect patients) and good validity as compared with two other measures of BRN or multimodal neglect. Patient examples show that BRN as assessed with the vest test allows the detection of qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of BRN, and shows double dissociations from visual neglect and from apraxia in left hemisphere stroke patients. Details of the test including instructions and cut-off values are given for users in the appendix of this article. In conclusion, the vest test is a sensitive, quick and reliable test for BRN which complements the assessment of visuo- and audiospatial neglect and allows to measure recovery (spontaneous or treatment-induced) in patients with BRN. Furthermore, it can help to improve our knowledge about the multisensory coding of our body and the surrounding space in the human brain.",{},,Restorative neurology and neuroscience,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

However, language has the capacity to influence the selection of purposeful actions. The abilities to use language and to program purposeful movements are often mediated by networks that have anatomic proximity. With hemispheric injury, the diagnosis of apraxia is often confounded by the specific influence of language impairments on the ability to select and produce transitive gestures. We report a patient who illustrates this confound. This patient is a right-handed man who developed global aphasia and neglect after a right hemispheric stroke. His right hand remained deft, and when asked to produce specific transitive gestures (pantomimes), he often performed normally but did make some body part as object and perseverative errors. However, he did not demonstrate the temporal or spatial errors typical of ideomotor apraxia. He also had a perseverative agraphia. Our patient's left hemisphere praxis system appeared to be intact, and the error types demonstrated during production of transitive gestures cannot be attributed to a degradation of postural and movement (praxis) programs mediated by his left hemisphere. The praxis errors types are most consistent with a deficit in the ability to select the necessary praxis programs. Thus, our patient appeared to have dissociation between language and praxis programs that resulted in body part as object and perseverative errors.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.770883,PMC3732537,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment was implemented in two health subjects to reveal the difference of brain activation between protocol A and B. The results showed that protocol A rather than protocol B significantly improved the CBIT-HK scores at first and third weeks, respectively. Protocol A induced more bilateral activations including right inferior parietal lobe (supramarginal gyrus), which belongs to MNS and is also critical region resulting to hemineglect.

A distinction between 'grasping distance' and 'walking distance', or between a 'reaching field' and a pointing or throwing field has commonly been made. Evidence for such a division has been found in monkeys. Unilateral ablation of the frontal eye field (area 8) produces a more prominent inattention (or 'neglect') for objects in contralesional far space than in near space; by contrast, unilateral ablation of frontal area 6, which receives direct projections from area 7b (the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobules) results in inattention to visual stimuli limited to contralesional near space. Despite predictions that comparable dissociations should be found in man, there has been no convincing evidence. We report here such evidence in a patient with a unilateral right hemisphere stroke. Within peripersonal space, he showed severe left visuo-spatial neglect on conventional tests, including the highly sensitive task of line bisection.

However, only few studies have successfully recorded on-line the activation of the autonomous or the motoric nervous systems. The activation of the motor system by unconscious stimuli would be a strong argument that information processing in the brain is not organized into two serial steps (stimulus identification first, response selection second). This would argue for parallel processes of stimuli identification routines and response selection mechanisms on the basis of only provisionally worked out stimulus features. Investigating an anosognostic patient we found electrodermal activity (EDA) and electromyographic responses (EMG) to bimanual tasks, mental imagery, and to the request to execute specific actions. But overt behavior remained hemiplegic and the patient was unable to feel any kind of control of her paralyzed left arm and hand. Generally, the data can be interpreted along the lines of a theory of two different routes to action, leaving the unconscious selection of action patterns intact, whereas the intentional triggering of overt behavior with the left hand and arm was impossible for the patient.",{},,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,10.1007/BF02191815,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A long-lasting improvement concerned the right-page preference reflecting the ipsilesional bias but also the sloping lines and the broken lines reflecting visuo-constructive disorders in handwriting. Moreover, a transient improvement was also evidenced for the graphic errors. These results reinforce the idea that the process of prism adaptation may activate brain functions related to multisensory integration and higher spatial representations and show a generalization at a functional level.

If perception of the velocity of a moving stimulus is due to a calculation of the distance covered per unit time in representational space, then a stimulus with uniform linear motion should be perceived as decelerating when moving leftwards in the visual field of a subject with left unilateral neglect. We investigated the perception of acceleration in a patient with left unilateral neglect and spatial distortion (revealed as relative left overextension in a line extension task) using a task in which the stimuli were right and left moving targets with variable acceleration. The patient's ability to perceive acceleration was much lower (higher acceleration threshold) for leftward movements than rightward movements. Fourteen months later unilateral neglect had improved, and the relative left overextension and decreasing acceleration threshold for leftward movements were reduced. By contrast, alterations in the perception of acceleration for leftward movements were not found in a patient with left unilateral neglect and left underextension and in a patient with right brain damage and left hemianopia.

Psychological testing showed an abnormal tendency of this patient to respond to local features, but perfect accuracy in interpreting global features when the local features could not interfere in global processing.

Correct diagnosis of epileptic seizures required longer-term EEG monitoring. Review of clinical history, neurologic examination, imaging, and findings on prolonged EEG monitoring. A patient with a new onset of a profound left neglect had normal strength and language use, with no obvious clinical seizures. A right hemisphere embolic stroke was diagnosed, but MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging showed no evidence of ischemia. The initial EEG showed marked right parietal voltage suppression, with subsequent brief electrographic seizures and later, right parietal periodic discharges. The second patient had an earlier right subdural hematoma and focal motor seizures but was admitted with a new neglect syndrome and no clear clinical seizures. Head computed tomography showed no new lesion. EEG showed frequent right parieto-temporal epileptiform discharges and electrographic seizures. The neglect syndromes resolved with anticonvulsant treatment, but in both cases, electrographic seizures were intermittent, and there was no strict correlation between the clinical deficit and EEG manifestations of seizures. Infrequently, the sudden onset of new hemispatial neglect can be caused by nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, even when there is no weakness and no clear clinical seizure activity. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus can cause primarily perceptual and cognitive syndromes. The correlation between the clinical deficits and seizure activity on the EEG, however, is imprecise.

Paying attention especially to their reading defects, a possible role of the persons with contralateral neglect is proposed in the development of script.

His CT and MRI scans disclosed major lesions situated in the posterior half of the genu and the whole trunk of the corpus callosum, as well as in the left medial frontal and temporo-occipital lobes. Left hemispatial neglect was invariably demonstrated in right-hand performance such as copying drawings, line bisection, matching identical figures and copying multiple digit numbers, and in verbal performance such as confrontation naming and reading aloud multiple digit numbers. In contrast, little or no right hemispatial neglect was demonstrated in tasks performed with the left hand. These findings support the hypothesis that the left hemisphere is only concerned with attending to the contralateral hemispace and that the right hemisphere is specialized for attending to both sides of space although the preponderant tendency is for attending to the contralateral hemispace. The neglect symptoms observed in our patient may be a disconnection sign which was attributable to a combination of lesions in the corpus callosum and in the left medial frontal lobe.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/113.4.1005,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We now report five patients with severe white matter edema after carotid surgery, a finding not previously included in the hyperperfusion syndrome. Five to 8 days after carotid surgery and after hospital discharge, each patient developed hypertension, headache, hemiparesis, seizures, and aphasia or neglect due to severe white matter edema ipsilateral to the carotid surgery. One patient had a small hemorrhage within the edematous area. Hypertension was severe in four patients and moderate in one. The carotid artery was patent by ultrasound or angiography in each patient after surgery. Transcranial Doppler showed increased velocities ipsilateral to surgery in two patients and bilaterally in one. Computed tomographic abnormalities and neurologic signs resolved within 3 weeks in four of the five patients treated with antihypertensives and anticonvulsants.

A 57-year-old woman underwent surgery for a ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm. After she recovered consciousness, it was found that she had left homonymous hemianopia and left hemispatial neglect. Although the hemispatial neglect slowly improved, the homonymous hemianopia persisted. MRI and measurements of cerebral glucose metabolism by 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose(FDG)-PET were performed 1 year later. MRI revealed infarctions on the medial surface of the frontal lobe, on the right medial surface of the occipital lobe, and global atrophy of the right cortical hemisphere. FDG-PET disclosed severe glucose hypometabolism in the entire right hemisphere. Glucose metabolism in the right occipital cortex was 61.1% of that in the homologous region on the left side, 62.8% in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and 93.8% in the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. The low glucose metabolism in the right visual cortex explains the persistent left hemianopia, and that in the right anterior cingulate gyrus and the right temporal-parietal-occipital junction may be responsible for the left hemispatial neglect. The relatively mild damage in the right temporal-parietal-occipital junction explained the recovery of the neglect symptom.

3942858,"Infarcts of both inferior parietal lobules with impairment of visually guided eye movements, peripheral visual inattention and optic ataxia.","Pierrot-Deseilligny, C; Gray, F; Brunet, P",Pierrot-Deseilligny,"Clinicopathological correlations are reported in a case with bilateral isolated infarcts in the posterior part of the parietal lobes, due to nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis accompanying pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The initial left-sided infarct induced right visual neglect, impairment of right-beating optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), optic ataxia, Gerstmann's syndrome and apraxia. After the right-sided infarct, which occurred six weeks later, bilateral visuo-oculomotor disturbances were observed, including peripheral visual inattention, disorder of visually guided saccades, severe impairment of foveal smooth pursuit and OKN slow phase. The lesion on the left involved the upper part of the angular gyrus and a part of the adjacent superior parietal lobule (SPL). That on the right involved the supramarginal gyrus and extended posteriorly into the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, into both margins of the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and into a small part of the SPL. As the oculomotor deficits and the peripheral visual inattention were bilateral after the second infarct, they probably resulted from the lesion of homologous areas in both cerebral hemispheres. The zone damaged in common included a small part of the SPL, the superoanterior extremity of the angular gyrus, and the adjacent intraparietal sulcus and a small portion of the subcortical white matter. This restricted cerebral zone could therefore, in man, be implicated both in the control of all visually guided eye movements and in visual attention. It is further suggested that two corticofugal pathways are implicated in visually guided saccades, the first arising from the frontal eye fields and projecting directly onto the premotor structures in the brainstem, the second arising from the posterior parietal cortex (probably mainly the intraparietal sulcus adjacent to the angular gyrus) and including a relay in the superior colliculus before reaching the premotor structures. Lastly, the findings support the hypothesis that optic ataxia results from interruption of direct and/or crossed occipitofrontal pathways coursing in the deep white matter of the parietal lobe.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/109.1.81,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
15128614,The human basis pontis: motor syndromes and topographic organization.,"Schmahmann, Jeremy D; Ko, Ryeowon; MacMore, Jason",Schmahmann,"Clinical-anatomic correlations were performed in 25 patients with focal infarcts in the basilar pons to determine whether pontine lacunar syndromes conform to discrete clinical entities, and whether there is topographic organization of the motor system within the human basis pontis. Twelve clinical signs were scored on a 6-point scale, neuroimaging lesions were mapped and defined with statistical certainty, and structure-function correlation was performed to develop a topographic map of motor function. Clinical findings ranged from major devastation following extensive lesions (pure motor hemiplegia) to incomplete basilar pontine syndrome and restricted deficits after small focal lesions (ataxic hemiparesis, dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, dysarthria-dysmetria and dysarthria-facial paresis). The syndromes are not absolutely discrete, and are distinguished from each other by the relative degree of involvement of each clinical feature. Structure-function correlations indicate that strength is conveyed by the corticofugal fibres destined for the spinal cord, whereas dysmetria results from lesions involving the neurons of the basilar pons that link the ipsilateral cerebral cortex with the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Facial movement and articulation are localized to rostral and medial basilar pons; hand coordination is medial and ventral in rostral and mid-pons; and arm function is represented ventral and lateral to the hand. Leg coordination is in the caudal half of the pons, with lateral predominance. Swallowing is dependent upon the integrity of a number of regions in the rostral pons. Gait is in medial and lateral locations throughout the rostral- caudal extent of the pons. Dysmetria ipsilateral to the lesion constitutes a disconnection syndrome, as it occurs when the hemipontine lesion is extensive and interrupts pontocerebellar fibres traversing from the opposite, intact side of the pons. The heterogeneity of manifestations reflects the well-organized topography of motor function in the human basis pontis, in agreement with the anatomic organization of the motor corticopontine projections in the monkey. Higher order impairments including motor neglect, paraphasic errors and pathological laughter result from rostral and medial pontine lesions, and may result from disruption of the pontine component of associative corticopontocerebellar circuits.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh138,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The behavioral pattern of error in the two bisection tasks mirrored the one previously described in left-neglect patients. In other words, our patient misplaced the subjective midpoint (numerical or visual) to the left as function of the interval size. These data, paired with the patient's lesion site are strictly consistent with the tripartite organization of number-related processes in the parietal lobes as proposed by Dehaene and colleagues. According to these authors, the posterior superior parietal lobe on both hemispheres underpins the attentional orientation on the putative mental number line, the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus is bilaterally related to the semantic of the numerical domain, whereas the left angular gyrus subserves the verbal knowledge of numbers. In summary, our results suggest that the processes involved in the navigation along the mental number line, which are related to the parietal mechanisms for spatial attention, and the processes involved in the semantic and verbal knowledge of numbers, are dissociable.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2008.05.007,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

However, in a following study, the same research group failed to reproduce this left hand amelioration effect if the left hand was initially placed on the right side, and they claimed that spatio-motor cueing was more important in reducing unilateral neglect than the hand used. The present study concerns with the validity of these two theoretical views on modification of unilateral neglect, i.e., hemispheric activation and spatio-motor cueing. A patient with left unilateral neglect and a slight left hemiparesis participated in three experiments. Under conventional testing condition, line bisection performed with the right hand showed more severe left neglect than when performed with the left hand. These hand effects were modified by changing a starting position of the patient's hand when bisecting horizontal lines.

Initial, computed tomography of brain showed hyperdense lesion in the parieto-occipital convexity subarachnoid space on the right cerebral hemisphere mimicking subarachnoid hemorrhage and computed tomography angiography showed no significant abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed intense pial enhancement in the right temporo-parieto-occipital region with a subtle T2W hyperintense signal in the underlying subcortical white matter without edema or infarct or mass effect. Digital subtraction cerebral angiography (DSA) showed hypertrophy of the cerebral arteries, arteriolo-capillary bed and venules in the right temporo-parieto-occipital territory associated with early arterio-capillary and venous opacification. Serial MRI done after six months, one and two years showed increase in the T2W hyperintense signal in the subcortical white matter and cortical atrophy with no changes in the pial enhancement.

We present a case of delayed thrombectomy in a 43-year-old man with acute dysarthria, left-sided weakness, and visual neglect. Initial MRI/A demonstrated a small completed stroke and a thrombus in the right middle cerebral artery. Thirty-seven hours after symptom onset, his weakness acutely worsened. A repeat MRI revealed an unchanged core infarct volume and a cerebral angiogram suggested an abrupt occlusion of the right distal M1. Thrombectomy was performed with complete reperfusion and the patient's strength recovered following the procedure. We compared our clinical reasoning with the DEFUSE-3 and DAWN study criteria, and conclude that there is a subset of patients that may safely benefit from thrombectomy in later time windows beyond the trial criteria, especially in the setting of clinical examination of imaging mismatch.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000492892,PMC6180256,Delayed thrombectomy; Ischemic stroke; Mechanical endovascular thrombectomy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
31543787,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Improves Pusher Phenomenon.,"Yamaguchi, Takuya; Satow, Takeshi; Komuro, Taro; Mima, Tatsuya",Yamaguchi,"An 83-year-old man suffered from cerebral infarction of the right middle cerebral artery territory. In association with severe left hemiparesis and hemispatial neglect on the left side, he showed severe pusher phenomenon (PP), which made rehabilitation difficult. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied to the parietal area (2 mA × 20 min/day; anode on the right and cathode on the left) for 8 days, which resulted in remarkable improvement of PP and caused prolongation of static sitting time. tDCS of the parietal area could be a novel treatment option of PP following stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000497284,PMC6739711,Parietal area; Pusher phenomenon; Transcranial direct current stimulation,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
7468144,[Hemineglect after right lesion. A report on three cases (author's transl)].,"van der Linden, M; Seron, X; Gillet, J; Bredart, S",van der Linden,This paper is concerned with the observation of three cases of hemineglect after right frontal lesion. A review of cases indicates clear predominance of that semiology in subjects with right hemispheric damage. The observations are discussed with regards to facts and theoretical interpretations about the role of frontal areas in the determinism of hemineglect.,{},,Acta neurologica Belgica,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Italy,fre
7247787,Thalamic neglect. Possible role of the medial thalamus and nucleus reticularis in behavior.,"Watson, R T; Valenstein, E; Heilman, K M",Watson,"A patient had an ischemic infarction of the right medial thalamus, with a resultant contralateral neglect syndrome. We propose that the medial thalamic nuclei, particularly centromedian and parafascicularis (CMPF), are normally involved in the arousal-activation process by which an organism can be aroused by and respond to novel or important stimuli. Specifically, we propose that (1) the mesencephalic reticular formation subserves tonic arousal to novel or painful stimuli by inhibiting the nucleus reticularis thalami (NR) and (2) that selective attention is mediated by cortical input to NR. The CMPF is closely associated with motor systems (basal ganglia, ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus [VL], and frontal lobes). A pathway involving CMPF, the frontal cortex, and the portion of NR associated with VL may be important in preparing the tonically aroused organism for action. Unilateral lesions of CMPF therefore induce an asymmetric hypokinesia, and bilateral lesions may induce akinetic mutism.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1981.00510080063009,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
