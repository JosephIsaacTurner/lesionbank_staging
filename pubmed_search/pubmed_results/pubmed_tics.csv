29419420,Diaphragmatic flutter.,"Walton, Dean; Bonello, Michael; Steiger, Malcolm",Walton,"A 78-year-old woman presented with involuntary movements of her abdomen, which started after a right hemispheric stroke. She had irregular, variable, hyperkinetic predominantly right-sided abdominal wall movements. MR scan of brain confirmed a recent infarct in the right occipitotemporal lobe and the right cerebellum. Diaphragmatic fluoroscopy confirmed high-frequency flutter as the cause of her abdominal movements and confirmed the diagnosis of van Leeuwenhoek's disease. Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek first described this condition in 1723 and had the condition himself. He was a Dutch businessman who is often acknowledged as the first microscopist and microbiologist. He disagreed with his physician who attributed his ailment as being of cardiac origin. Diaphragmatic flutter is a rare disorder that requires a high index of suspicion with symptoms including abnormal abdominal wall movements, dyspnoea and respiratory distress. Despite medical treatment, the patient was still highly symptomatic, so she is currently being considered for a phrenic nerve crush.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Practical neurology,10.1136/practneurol-2017-001830,,diaphragmatic flutter; diaphragmatic myoclonus; movement disorders,Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Portrait,England,eng

Two other patients had lateral thalamic infarcts on computed tomography, normal angiographic findings, and presumed thalamogeniculate artery branch occlusion. There are three clinical syndromes associated with lateral thalamic infarction: (1) hemisensory loss, hemiataxia, and involuntary movements; (2) pure sensory stroke; and (3) sensory-motor stroke. Ataxia, adventitious movements, and sensory loss are due to infarction of the lateral, posterolateral, and posteromedial ventral nuclei caused by occlusion of the PCA proximal to the thalamogeniculate artery branches or by occlusion of large thalamogeniculate arteries. Pure sensory and sensory-motor strokes are due to smaller infarcts in the posterolateral-posteromedial ventral complex and adjacent internal capsule caused by occlusion of penetrating artery branches of the thalamogeniculate arteries.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1988.00520330037008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Head trauma has been recognised as an infrequent cause of adult-onset tic disorder, which exhibits variable temporal relationship to the inciting injury and response to therapy. We present a patient who presented with late-onset tics seven years after a circumscribed brain injury, responding well to antidopaminergic treatment. A review of all the previously reported cases of post-traumatic tic disorder is provided. Our patient is unusual in that the injury presumed to be responsible for the development of tics was of a very focal nature, akin to previously described tic disorder following vascular insults.

Physical examination and laboratory tests revealed no other findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hyperintensity in the right posterolateral thalamic region consistent with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Symptomatic therapy was indicated and his underlying conditions were addressed.

This is a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with motor weakness and involuntary movement of the left upper extremity. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the right frontal hemorrhagic mass lesion without enhancement of contrast medium. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography showed no vascular stain and abnormal arteriovenous shunt. Preoperatively, we diagnosed cavernous hemangioma with a hemorrhagic component located in the right motor cortex. Because this case was symptomatic, we performed a craniotomy and gross total resection of the right frontal lesion.

HLE is caused by cerebral white matter damage secondary to exposure to toxic agents such as chemotherapeutic drugs, environmental toxins, and drugs of abuse. Here, we present the case of a 20-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for bipolar disorder and opioid use who presented to the emergency department with ataxia, involuntary movements, and altered mental status secondary to inhalational heroin use. The patient presented with symptoms including agitation, tremors, speech difficulty, confusion, memory loss, and weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse cerebral atrophy and electroencephalography (EEG) was significant for cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere and diffuse encephalopathy. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids, vitamins, and fluids but failed to show improvement. She was subsequently discharged to hospice 17 days after admission. There are few reported cases of toxic leukoencephalopathy due to heroin inhalation. The patient's young age and presentation following one month of abstinence are particularly unique as she suffered an acute decompensation with severe, lasting neurological deficits. This case highlights a potential presentation of HLE and seeks to increase clinical recognition in patients with a recent history of substance use and unexplained neurological symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.42323,PMC10443436,critical emergency medicine; heroin use; heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy; neuroimaging; neurology,Case Reports,United States,eng

However, the clinical features of anti-IgLON5 disease resembling MSA have not been well established. We enrolled 35 patients with suspected MSA for whom anti-IgLON5 antibody tests were requested. We evaluated immunoglobulin G (IgG) against IgLON5 using cell-based assays. We also summarized the clinical characteristics of patients who were positive for anti-IgLON5 antibodies. We identified serum and cerebrospinal fluid anti-IgLON5 antibodies in three patients. These patients had many clinical features characteristic of MSA, including parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, severe orthostatic hypotension, acute respiratory failure, sleep parasomnia, vocal cord paralysis, and pyramidal tract signs. Clinical features atypical for MSA were myorhythmia, horizontal eye movement restriction, fasciculations, and painful muscle cramps. Anti-IgLON5 disease may be an important differential diagnosis of MSA. A comprehensive physical examination, including assessments of eye movement, lower motor neuron signs, and atypical involuntary movements, is important to avoid misdiagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.parkreldis.2024.106992,,Anti-IgLON5 disease; Multiple system atrophy; Orthostatic hypotension; Vocal cord paralysis,Journal Article; Case Reports,England,eng

In stroke, a common cause of chorea, basal ganglia are anatomical locations that can cause chorea when a stroke occurs, and chorea is less frequently triggered by a stroke in other anatomical brain regions. Herein, we report a rare case of monochorea after acute contralateral pontine infarction. A 32-year-old man visited the emergency room due to dysarthria and right hemiparesis that occurred approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes before the visit. A brain magnetic resonance image confirmed a diffusion restriction lesion in the left pons. The patient was initially diagnosed with acute infarction at the left pons and began to receive medical treatment with an antiplatelet agent and statin with admission. Approximately 14 hours after the onset of the initial stroke symptoms, the patient complained of involuntary movement in the right arm for the first time. Intermittent, irregular involuntary movements were observed in the distal part of the right arm. This symptom was unpredictable and random, and a similar symptom was not observed in other parts of the patient's body. Clinically, post-stroke monochorea was suspected. The symptom improved from day 5 without specific medical treatment for chorea. The monochorea caused by the pontine lesion in this case was triggered by the direct lesions of the corticospinal tract, and its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. However, abnormal movements can occur due to inadequate downstream activation or inhibition of the corticospinal tract, which is induced by functional abnormalities of the motor cortex. This case suggests that further investigation is needed on the mechanisms of direct corticospinal tract lesions for chorea.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000032660,PMC9857559,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

He was diagnosed with ischemic stroke in the left prefrontal area and cingulated gyrus by brain magnetic imaging. Needle electromyography of the right vastus lateralis muscle while standing showed intermittent periods of EMG silence, consistent with asterixis.

The differential diagnosis of this presentation includes rhythmic movement phenomena, such as leg myoclonus, alternating leg muscle activation, and periodic leg movements of sleep. The patient had a history of tremor‐predominant Parkinson's disease since age 43 years. He underwent deep brain stimulation surgery at the National Institutes of Health after an overnight dopaminergic medication withdrawal. Shortly after anesthetic induction, he developed periodic, involuntary movements of his legs that were stereotyped, bilateral and synchronous. The movements were characterized by partial flexion of the ankle, knee, and hip for 3 or 4 seconds at intervals of 5 to 10 seconds. After cessation of the anesthetic infusion, his movements promptly subsided. The total duration of the event was approximately 2 minutes. There were no residual motor or sensory deficits on neurologic examination. Although the exact mechanism responsible for the described observation requires further investigation, this phenomenology should be known, because its occurrence under intravenous anesthetics could be confused for other, pathophysiologically different phenomena.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Movement disorders clinical practice,10.1002/mdc3.12310,PMC5321658,Leg Movements; Parkinson Disease; general anesthesia,Case Reports,United States,eng
38322679,Hemichorea in patients with temporal lobe infarcts: Two case reports.,"Wang, Xu-Dong; Li, Xing; Pan, Chun-Lian",Wang,"Hemichorea and other hyperkinetic movement disorders are uncommon presentations of stroke and are usually secondary to deep infarctions affecting the basal ganglia and thalamus. Therefore, temporal ischemic lesions causing hemichorea are rare. We report the cases of two patients with acute ischemic temporal lobe infarct strokes that presented as hemichorea. Patient 1: An 82-year-old woman presented with a 1-mo history of involuntary movement of the left extremity, which was consistent with hemichorea. Her diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed an acute ischemic stroke that predominantly affected the right temporal cortex, and magnetic resonance angiography of the head showed significant stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment with 2.5 mg of olanzapine per day was initiated. When she was discharged from the hospital, her symptoms appeared to have improved compared with those previously observed. Twenty-seven days after the first admission, she was readmitted due to acute ischemic stroke. Computed tomography perfusion showed marked hypoperfusion in the right MCA territory. An emergency transfemoral cerebral angiogram was performed and showed severe stenosis in the M1 segment of the right MCA. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was successfully performed, abnormal movements or other neurologic problems did not occur. Patient 2: A 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a 7-d history of right-upper-sided involuntary movements. DWI showed an acute patchy ischemic stroke in the left temporal lobe without basal ganglia involvement. Subsequent diffusion tensor imaging confirmed fewer white matter fiber tracts on the left side than on the opposite side. Treatment with 2.5 mg of olanzapine per day improved his condition, and he was discharged. When acute hemichorea suddenly appears, temporal cortical ischemic stroke should be considered a possible diagnosis. In addition, hemichorea may be a sign of impending cerebral infarction with MCA stenosis.",{},,World journal of clinical cases,10.12998/wjcc.v12.i4.806,PMC10841122,Acute ischemic stroke; Case report; Cortical hemichorea; Movement disorders; Temporal ischemic stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng
31890704,Neuroradiological Evolution of Glycaemic Hemichorea-Hemiballism and the Possible Role of Brain Hypoperfusion.,"Marinelli, Lucio; Maggi, Davide; Trompetto, Carlo; Renzetti, Paolo",Marinelli,"Lateralized involuntary movements consistent with hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear following the development of contralateral haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). This condition is called vascular HCHB, but the same symptoms can be caused by a completely different striatal lesion. Glycaemic HCHB may occur in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia: basal ganglia hyperdensity is seen on brain CT, while increased T1 signal intensity and reduced susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and gradient-echo sequences (T2*-GRE) are detected on MRI. An 83-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia was admitted for ischaemic stroke presenting with dysarthria and mild left hemiparesis. No involuntary movements were reported at admission. The emergent brain CT scan was negative for vascular acute lesions, while a mild bilateral hyperdensity of the striata was detectable. Involuntary movements on the left side of the body, consistent with HCHB, appeared 27 days later. The alterations on brain CT completely disappeared after 3 months. On brain MRI, the T1 signal alterations resolved after 10 months, while SWI and T2*-GRE sequences showed persisting alterations after 2 years. Detailed brain imaging demonstrated evolution of striatal alterations of glycaemic HCHB before the appearance of involuntary movements and during the following 2 years. The association between ischaemic stroke and glycaemic HCHB favours the hypothesis that chronic hyperglycaemia more likely determines striatal alterations and the clinical picture of HCHB when vascular hypoperfusion also occurs. Hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia accompanied by typical neuroradiological features consisting of striatal alterations detectable on brain CT and MRI, often bilaterally.Unusually, striatal alterations can be detected before the appearance of involuntary movements and are fully reversible on brain CT and T1-MRI sequences.Brain hypoperfusion may facilitate the appearance of typical HCHB in patients with chronic hyperglycaemia.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,10.12890/2019_001257,PMC6886634,Hemichorea; athetosis; hemiballism; hyperglycemia; hypoperfusion,Case Reports,Italy,eng

Although dystonia can occur as a symptom of moyamoya disease, few studies have reported truncal dystonia occurring with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis. Here, we report a case of truncal dystonia with MCA occlusion. The patient was a 48-year-old female clerical worker who lived alone. An abnormal cervical posture initially appeared 7 years before (right flexion). Symptoms improved with medication and botulinum toxin injection. Five years before this report, her symptoms worsened, so the dose of oral medication was increased and botulinum treatment was performed, but the symptoms did not improve. The patient showed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortical areas but not in the basal ganglia. We performed superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass surgery because we believed that the dystonia was due to right MCA stenosis. The patient's symptoms improved immediately after surgery, except for her mild cervical backbend. Seven months after the surgery, the patient's involuntary movements showed further improvement, and symptoms have not worsened even after 2 years. Revascularization therapy improved CBF and truncal dystonia and could be a viable treatment option for dystonia with ischemia in the MCA region. Extensive cerebral ischemia can result in cortical inhibition loss or over-adapted cerebral plasticity and cause dystonia. Revascularization therapy may be useful for patients with dystonia and decreased CBF in the MCA region.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_173_2022,PMC9062919,Cerebral blood flow; Dystonia; Middle cerebral artery stenosis; Network pathophysiology model; Revascularization,Case Reports,United States,eng

Magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute infarction in the right thalamus and the insular cortex, left extracranial carotid stenosis at 80%, and low flow in the right middle cerebral artery but did not explain limb-shaking syndrome symptomatology. We performed comparative positional brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), in the upright and in the supine position, to explore and localize hypoperfusion-endangered brain structures that may be involved in the presenting symptoms. Brain perfusion SPECT showed deep hypoperfusion in bilateral carotid territories in the upright position in favor of a hemodynamic mechanism, on which blood pressure was maintained higher to avoid hypoperfusion and the patient remained supine for a longer period of time than in the usual support. Late postoperative brain perfusion SPECT after left endarterectomy did not show significant abnormalities. Limb-shaking syndrome may be related to a transient decrease in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow caused by postural changes. Positional brain perfusion SPECT seems to be helpful to improve clinical care.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) on the right side, and she underwent direct and indirect bypasses on this side. Involuntary movements appeared in her right upper limb immediately postoperatively. SPECT showed decreased CBF to the bilateral frontal lobes. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with limb-shaking syndrome. After performing left-hemispheric revascularisation, the patient's symptoms resolved, and SPECT imaging confirmed improvements in CBF to the bilateral frontal lobes. Revascularization for moyamoya disease can lead to watershed shifts, which can induce limb-shaking syndrome derived from abnormalities in the contralateral hemisphere of the revascularized side. For patients with new-onset limb-shaking syndrome after moyamoya revascularisation procedures, additional revascularization may be warranted for treatment of low perfusion areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_937_2021,PMC8645482,Limb-shaking syndrome; Moyamoya disease; Postoperative involuntary movement; Watershed shift,Case Reports,United States,eng

It can be classified as neoplastic or idiopathic, with small cell lung cancer being commonly associated. Herein, we present a rare case of refractory paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) caused by large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), a rare form of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A 60-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with acute-onset dysarthria, gait instability, and numbness on the right side of his body. According to the clinical symptoms and neurological examination, we initially suspected cerebellar infarction; however, brain imaging revealed no abnormal findings. After a few days, the patient developed worsening horizontal nystagmus, irregular ocular rhythms, and generalized involuntary movements, indicative of OMS. A systemic evaluation revealed a solitary nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung, leading to a clinical diagnosis of PNS. The patient underwent segmentectomy to treat an early-stage LCNEC nodule after one month from onset. Despite all therapeutic interventions, OMS was refractory, and after consulting with the person himself and the family, palliative care was selected. However, the patient showed a clinical response belatedly five months after surgery. This case highlights the importance of considering PNS, and that it may be associated with a rare malignancy when cerebellar symptoms are observed, and the challenges in managing refractory PNS associated with rare forms of NSCLC.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48911,PMC10725307,case report; large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma; literature review; opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome; paraneoplastic neurological syndrome; refractory,Case Reports,United States,eng

Both patients were treated at an inpatient rehabilitation center and made a significant recovery in both function and activities of daily living. Although hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome has known pharmacological treatments, little has been reported on the effectiveness of acute rehabilitation on managing and treating this syndrome. The first case involves a 44-year-old Hispanic male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anxiety, and depression who presented with continuous, uncontrollable, unilateral movements 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed lesions in the basal ganglia, confirming the diagnosis of hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome. The patient was started on antipsychotic medications and antihyperglycemic medications controlling glucose levels, but continued to have hemiballismus symptoms. The second case involves a 78-year-old Haitian female with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with weakness and continuous, involuntary movements in her upper and lower extremities 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia and encephalopathy.

It can be a significant symptom in various neurologic diseases, including metabolic, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative conditions. The neural foundation that underlies the genesis of chorea appears to be fairly diverse, even though its pathophysiology is frequently associated with the malfunctioning of inhibitory circuits within the basal ganglia. Movement disorders such as tremors, myoclonus, ataxia, chorea, and Parkinsonism may arise due to renal dysfunction or complications from management like renal transplant and hemodialysis. Uremic encephalopathy is a rare but potentially life-threatening neurological complication of chronic kidney disease. We present a case of a 50-year-old male with a known history of chronic kidney disease and chronic alcoholism, who exhibited abnormal movements resembling chorea upon presentation. Initially suspected as alcohol withdrawal-related chorea, further evaluation revealed concurrent rising creatinine levels, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Hemodialysis was initiated, resulting in a significant improvement in choreoathetoid movements.

By collecting clinical information from admitted patients positive for glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody, the clinical characteristics of a new patient positive for GlyR antibody were reported in this study. To obtain additional information regarding anti-GlyR antibody-linked illness, clinical data and findings on both newly reported instances in this study and previously published cases were merged and analyzed. A new case of anti-GlyR antibody-related progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) was identified in this study. A 20-year-old man with only positive cerebrospinal fluid anti-GlyR antibody had a good prognosis with first-line immunotherapy. The literature review indicated that the common clinical manifestations of anti-GlyR antibody-related disease included PERM or stiff-person syndrome (SPS) (n = 179, 50.1%), epileptic seizure (n = 94, 26.3%), and other neurological disorders (n = 84, 24.5%). Other neurological issues included demyelination, inflammation, cerebellar ataxia and movement disorders, encephalitis, acute psychosis, cognitive impairment or dementia, celiac disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain and allodynia, steroid-responsive deafness, hemiballism/tics, laryngeal dystonia, and generalized weakness included respiratory muscles. The group of PERM/SPS exhibited a better response to immunotherapy than others. The findings suggest the presence of multiple clinical phenotypes in anti-GlyR antibody-related disease. Common clinical phenotypes include PERM, SPS, epileptic seizure, and paraneoplastic disease. Patients with RERM/SPS respond well to immunotherapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2024.1387591,PMC11215014,antiglycine receptor antibody; autoimmune; epilepsy; progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus; stiff-person syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

Based on the imaging studies that revealed multiple ischemic lesions and stenoses of both distal internal carotid arteries and the arteries of the circle of Willis, the diagnosis of MMV was established. The treatment with Verapamil was initiated, leading to symptom remission. Two months later, the patient presented one episode of dysarthria, followed by involuntary movements of the right upper limb, few days later. Long-term electroencephalogram monitoring depicted epileptiform abnormalities. Resolution of symptoms was obtained after increasing the dose of Verapamil, and initiating Levetiracetam. This is an interesting case of a patient with two rare pathologies, who presented with cerebral ischemic strokes. To our knowledge there are few cases described in the literature presenting with cerebral hemorrhagic events but none of them with multiple cerebral ischemic lesions.

MRI of the brain showed a well-defined heterogeneous hyperintense mass on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, with central hypointensity in the rostral commissure and septum pellucidum, and perilesional hyperintensity in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, suggestive of perilesional oedema. Gross examination in a transverse section of the brain at the level of the septum pellucidum revealed a 0.2 cm brown soft mass. Histopathological examination identified a biphasic neoplastic proliferation of mesenchymal and neuroepithelial cell populations. Fusiform cells were predominately distributed in bundles showing a high degree of anisocytosis and marked immune-positive reaction to vimentin immunochemistry, confirming a sarcomatous origin. Additionally, high numbers of astrocytic cells were identified by an intense immunopositive reaction to glial fibrillary acidic protein and negative reaction to oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 immunochemistry. Vascular invasion of the neoplasia into the wall of a medium branch of the rostral cerebral artery was present (secondary Scherer structures). Based on these characteristics, the tumour was defined as a gliosarcoma. Gliosarcoma is a recognised astrocytoma grade IV anaplastic glial cell tumour with sarcomatous differentiation.

Its frequency is probably underestimated due to their briefness and that they are often misinterpreted as epileptic seizures. Their pathophysiological mechanism is uncertain. Several mechanisms, such as the existence of a seizure-generating brainstem center, capable of generating epileptic activity or the interruption of the corticospinal tracts due to ischemia, have been proposed. We present three patients with disease of the basilar artery and extensive brainstem infarction who have the presentation of sudden, involuntary movements in limbs in the initial phase, in paroxysms of short duration and of varied semiology in common. We described this in all of them. An electroencephalographic functional study during these episodes was done in one of the cases. Preservation of conscious level, its variability of presentation, the null response to antiepileptic drugs and normality of the electroencephalogram in one of them leads us to ratify the hypothesis of failure of the cortical inhibitory projections as subcortical centers in trunk or spinal cord as pathophysiological origin of these involuntary movements. We stress the importance of recognizing these clinical manifestations of appearance in the initial phases of the disease, that permit a rapid diagnosis with the help of the transcranial Doppler to establish an early and aggressive treatment of this disease having known seriousness and bad prognosis.

We report a case of hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) in a patient with diabetes. Clinical assessment of the patient was performed, along with laboratory tests and brain imaging. The patient was a 50-year-old man with newly detected diabetes with persistent involuntary movement of the right upper and lower limbs for few weeks. The involuntary movement was nonrhythmic, nonpatterned, purposeless, and often jerky with variable amplitude and frequency, sometimes wild and flailing in the form of hemichorea with a ballistic component (HCHB). He had a history of poor compliance to prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. At presentation, although he was hemodynamically stable, random capillary blood glucose level was 18 mmol/L and glycated hemoglobin A1 level was 15.1% (141.5 mmol/mol). Clinical examination did not reveal any focal deficit or positive Babinski sign. There was a hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia region in T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which was iso-to-hyperintense in T2-weighted image and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence. There was no restriction of diffusion on the diffusion-weighted image or blooming on gradient echo sequences, indicating absence of infarction or hemorrhage. Control of hyperglycemia resulted in disappearance of the involuntary movement within 1 month. While there are many differential diagnoses for HCHB, the clinical scenario suggests hyperglycemia as the underlying cause in this patient.

At that time point, all other investigations were unremarkable (including neurological examination and cMRI), but 2 years later, she presented with further neurological symptoms including tetraparesis mostly affecting the left limbs, distal hypesthesia and paresthesia, and dyspnea. Since further examinations (including EMG, MRI, CSF, virological, and bacteriological tests, as well as autoimmune-encephalitis antibodies) revealed normal results, based on clinical presentation, the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré-like immune-mediated neuropathy was made and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (30 g/day for 5 days) was initiated resulting in complete remission of immune-mediated neuropathy. Based on the ""immune hypothesis"" of GTS, we were interested in whether in this patient positive CSF OCBs might serve as a biomarker for treatment response of tics and additional GTS-related psychiatric symptoms to IVIg, and therefore assessed tics, premonitory urges, and psychiatric comorbidities before and several times after the IVIg treatment. However, even though immune-mediated neuropathy resolved after treatment, tics, premonitory urges, and comorbidities remained unchanged. Thus, this case study suggests that treatment with IVIg is not effective in the treatment of GTS-even in a patient with intrathecal antibody synthesis as expressed by CSF isolated OCBs.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.00110,PMC7059101,Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; cerebral spinal fluid; intrathecal antibody synthesis; intravenous immunoglobulin treatment; oligoclonal bands,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This leads to cerebral hemodynamic compromise and possible ischemic stroke. Another manifestation is limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks (LS-TIAs), characterized by rhythmic jerks which can be easily mistaken as a focal motor seizure. We describe a case of unilateral LS-TIAs from bilateral carotid occlusion that resolved with contralateral carotid revascularization. Our patient is a 65-year-old gentleman who had no significant co-morbidities other than a past history of bilateral neck irradiation for NPC 8 years before. He presented with left-sided limb weakness and subsequently left-sided limb involuntary movements whenever he sat up or stood. His symptoms did not respond to anti-epileptic therapy. Clinical and neurological examination was significant for a left pronator drift and weak left finger abduction. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed infarcts in the right periventricular and watershed areas; MR angiogram showed bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion. Single photon emission computed tomography showed reduced blood flow in the right frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, that reduced further after acetazolamide challenge. He was diagnosed as having LS-TIA secondary to carotid-occlusive disease. Attempts at endovascular opening the right internal carotid artery failed. Following successful left carotid angioplasty and stenting, his symptoms gradually resolved. The left internal carotid artery remained patent at the 3-month follow-up; the right side remained occluded. Our case supports the hypothesis that LS-TIAs are due to hemodynamic compromise and may respond to improved collateral cerebral blood flow.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000505391,PMC7802474,Carotid artery occlusion; Limb-shaking transient ischemic attack; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Neck radiation; Stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

She presented to our emergency department with chief complaints of abnormal involuntary movements and a feeling of foreignness on her left upper limb. The first neurological examination revealed left spatial neglect, left-side sensory impairment that included superficial and deep sensations, left limb-kinetic apraxia, and left limb ataxia. Furthermore, her symptoms and complaints had characteristics of AHS that includes a sensation that her left upper limb dose not belong to herself and an abnormal behavior of left hand that is contrary to her own intent. Brain MRI revealed an acute cerebral infarction confined to the right postcentral gyrus. This case highlights that sensory ataxia due to the disturbance of deep sensation might present symptoms similar to AHS. Previous studies suggested the involvement of the disturbance of somatosensory pathway in posterior-variant AHS. Therefore, a precise distinction between AHS and sensory ataxia, especially in posterior-variant AHS, is imperative to avoid confusion regarding the term ""alien hand sign.""","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001101,,alien hand sign; cerebral infarction; parietal lobe; postcentral gyrus; sensory ataxia,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Little is known about the effectiveness of oral medications on the cognitive and motor consequences. To present data suggesting partial improvement after administration of levodopa/benserazide. After observing partial benefit in one case, each patient admitted to rehabilitation following brain anoxia was systematically treated with levodopa/benserazide (200/50 to 400/100 mg/day), then bromocriptine (15 mg/day). In the first patient, brain anoxia was severe, with secondary agitation, quadriparesis, involuntary movements, inattention and communication disorders. Introduction of levodopa/benserazide resulted in reduction of agitation and involuntary movements and improvement of communication, thus facilitating care and rehabilitation efforts. A weaning test resulted in rapid worsening. The four following patients also presented with anoxia of variable severity. Marked improvement was observed in case 2, presenting with agitation, loss of orientation, amnesia, postural disorders, involuntary movements and dysphagia, with a withdrawal test resulting in immediate re-enhancement of symptoms. Modest improvement was observed in patient 3, who had hypokinesia, rigidity, adynamia, impaired attention, and reduced verbal fluency. Patient 4 presented with memory disorders without motor difficulties: mild improvement was observed in daily life and memory tests. In patient 5 who also presented with severe memory disorders, the benefit was absent. In each case, bromocriptine was introduced 3-4 weeks following levodopa, but without additive effect. Both treatments could be interrupted after a few months, without worsening. Levodopa and benserazide can be of benefit in the few months following brain anoxia, especially on some of the motor disorders and apathy, but the benefit is inconstant and modest on memory disorders. Anoxia could alter dopaminergic mesencephalic systems, which activate the striatal and mediobasal frontal cortex, and these disorders could be partially reversible by medical treatment.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-002-0903-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A further case is reported in the present paper. The definition of bilateral ballism is discussed, its movements described and the differences from chorea outlined. The most important difference from hemiballism is in the pathological substrate where, in most bilateral cases, diffuse lesions have been reported on both sides of the basal ganglia, without preferential involvement of the subthalamic nucleus. In our case, a fronto-temporal infarction was found. In the cases reported to date, the outcome had varied from death to complete recovery, partly depending on the aetiology, which is most frequently vascular. Although relevant data are scarce, dopamine antagonists appear to be the treatment of choice.

Few reports have described patients with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis, and no cases of psychosis associated with this encephalitis have been reported. We report a patient with anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis with Cotard and Capgras delusions who was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The patient was a 25-year-old woman. She exhibited disorientation, executive function deficits, tremors in the upper limbs, generalized athetoid-like involuntary movements, hallucinations, incontinence, and fever, which led to her admission to our hospital. Upon admission, she complained of Cotard delusions. Various diagnostic tests, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, antibody screening, and brain imaging, were unremarkable, except for positivity for serum anti-recoverin antibodies, non-specific general slowing on electroencephalography and decreased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the frontal and occipital lobes, and increased rCBF in the basal ganglia and pons on single-photon emission computed tomography. She was eventually diagnosed with encephalitis positive for anti-recoverin antibodies and treated with immunoglobulins and steroids. Her neurological symptoms improved temporarily, but three months later, psychiatric symptoms, i.e., suicidal thoughts and Cotard and Capgras delusions, were exaggerated. After ECT, her condition significantly improved. In conclusion, the present report suggests that pineal gland dysfunction due to anti-recoverin antibody or its cross-reactivity with neuron-specific calcium-binding proteins may contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in anti-recoverin antibody-positive encephalitis and that ECT can be a viable treatment option if immunotherapy proves ineffective. Additionally, decreased rCBF in the prefrontal cortex may be associated with the clinical features of Capgras and Cotard delusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1330745,PMC10850254,Capgras delusion; Cotard delusion; ECT; anti-recoverin antibody; case report; encephalitis; rCBF,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

An 8-year-old boy who developed hypoxic encephalopathy after asphyxia at the age of 2 had difficulty in remaining standing without support because of involuntary movements. He was instructed to remain standing with his plastic ankle-foot orthosis for 10 s at three time points by leaning forward with his forearms on a desk. He received cathodal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation to the supplementary motor area at 1 mA for 10 min. Involuntary movements during standing were measured using an accelerometer attached to his forehead. The low-frequency power of involuntary movements during cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation significantly decreased compared with that during sham stimulation. No adverse effects were observed. Involuntary movement reduction by cathodal stimulation to supplementary motor areas suggests that stimulations modulated the corticobasal ganglia motor circuit. Cathodal stimulation to supplementary motor areas may be effective for reducing involuntary movements and may be safely applied to children with movement disorders.,"DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in medicine,10.1155/2018/8934253,PMC5889880,,Case Reports,United States,eng

However, in some cases, pneumocephalus presents with headache, encephalopathy, or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. Here, we present a case of iatrogenic tension pneumocephalus following endoscopic sinus surgery, presenting as abnormal involuntary movements resembling a movement disorder with choreiform movements. A 67-year-old previously healthy male presented with new onset chorea and dystonia associated with headache, encephalopathy, and postural instability 4 days after undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. Computed tomography showed prominent intraventricular pneumocephalus causing enlargement of the anterior horns of both lateral ventricles with lateral displacement of the basal ganglia nuclei and a bony defect in the skull base. Neurosurgical correction of the cranial defect provided complete symptomatic resolution. Pneumocephalus as a result of an iatrogenic injury of the skull base manifesting as an acute movement disorder is a rare complication of a nasal sinus procedure.

This case report highlights the crucial role of thorough clinical examination and history-taking in diagnosing and managing a patient with metastatic breast cancer, mainly focusing on the successful integration of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS). We present a case of a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman with metastatic breast cancer, initially presenting with a primary tumour in the left breast and later developing a solitary brain metastasis (BM) in the left temporal lobe. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and left mastectomy, the patient experienced involuntary movements in the right arm, leading to the discovery of the brain lesion. Critical to this diagnosis was a detailed clinical examination emphasising the importance of vigilant monitoring in cancer management. The patient underwent GKRS, offering a focused and less invasive treatment approach with favourable outcomes. This case underscores the value of clinical vigilance in managing complex breast cancer cases. The integration of GKRS as a targeted treatment modality for BM represents a pivotal aspect of modern oncological care, especially for patients with multiple treatment modalities. This report emphasizes the importance of clinical examination in the early detection of complications such as BM in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, it demonstrates the effectiveness of GKRS in managing such metastases, reinforcing its role as a valuable tool in the multidisciplinary treatment approach for advanced breast cancer.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.51831,PMC10776030,brain metastasis; clinical examination; gamma knife radiosurgery; multidisciplinary treatment; stage iv breast cancer,Case Reports,United States,eng

Among them, 22 patients underwent either deep brain or epidural cortical stimulation in order to control their poststroke involuntary movements. The remaining 42 underwent epidural cortical stimulation for the purpose of controlling their poststroke pain. In the latter group of patients, we analyzed the changes in coexistent involuntary or voluntary movement disorders during stimulation for pain control. Stimulation of either the thalamic nucleus ventralis intermedius or the motor cortex proved to be useful in 13 (59%) of the patients who underwent deep brain or epidural cortical stimulation for control of poststroke involuntary movements. Satisfactory control was often achieved in patients with hemiballismus, hemichorea or resting tremor. In 8 (19%) of the patients who underwent epidural cortical stimulation for pain control, stimulation of the motor cortex improved motor performance which had been impaired in association with hemiparesis. Such an effect was independent of pain control and apparently resulted from an inhibition of their rigidity. We believe that these findings justify further clinical studies on deep brain or epidural cortical stimulation for the control of poststroke movement disorders.",{},,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000099855,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Although apraxia is a key finding for the differential diagnosis of CBD, it has not been determined whether the features of apraxia seen in subjects with CBD are similar to those features exhibited by subjects with left-hemisphere damage from stroke. Therefore, for both clinical purposes and in order to better understand the brain mechanisms that lead to apraxia in CBD, we studied praxis in a patient with CBD and compared him to patients who are apraxic from left-parietal strokes. We used three-dimensional movement analyses to compare the features of apraxic movement. This subject with CBD was a dentist whose initial complaint had been that he ""forgot"" how to use his tools in the mouths of his patients. Analyses were performed on the trajectories made when using a knife to actually slice bread, and when repetitively gesturing slicing made to verbal command. Movements of the left hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder were digitized in 3-D space. Although the CBD subject was clearly apraxic, the features of his apraxia differed markedly from those of the subjects with lesions in the left parietal lobe. For movements to command, the CBD subject showed joint coordination deficits, but his wrist trajectories were produced in the appropriate spatial plane, were correctly restricted to a single plane, and, like control subjects, were linear in path shape. However, when he was actually manipulating the tool and object, all of these aspects of his trajectories became impaired. In contrast, the deficits of the apraxic subjects with left-parietal damage were most pronounced to verbal command with their movements improving slightly although remaining impaired during actual tool and object manipulation. Unlike patients with parietal strokes, patients with CBD have degeneration in several systems and perhaps deficits in these other areas may account for the differences in praxic behavior.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1999.1084,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Forty-six cases are presented, and surgical techniques are described. In hemifacial spasm the intracranial neurovascular lysis of Jannetta is a valid operation with the best results to date but has a 7 1/2% risk of unilateral deafness. The extracranial submastoid partial section of Scoville is completely safe and gives excellent results, but there is a probability of mild to moderate return of the spasm in one to two year's time. In spastic torticollis the accepted radical operation consists of bilateral anterior rhizotomy of the upper three roots plus bilateral spinal accessory nerve section in the neck. A tragic complication of this operation has recently been observed by ourselves, Sweet, and Hamlin. This complication is bilateral infarction of the medulla (bilateral Wallenberg's syndrome). This has also been reported as occurring following chiropractic manipulations. For this reason the writer does limited unilateral sectioning of the spinal accessory nerve in the neck and resection of the upper third of the sternomastoid muscle, as a first stage procedure, in those cases in which rotation of the neck is the principal symptom, before doing the radical operation. Safeguards to prevent this complication include preoperative vertebral arteriography and preservation of both motor and sensory radicular arteries under magnification and maintenance of adequate neck support during the early postoperative days.",{},,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/BF01406020,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

We extensively reviewed the case histories with current clinical and laboratory evaluations that include testing for antibodies to NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDAR in serum/CSF available from the time of symptom onset (4 to 7 years ago) and the present. All patients sequentially developed prodromal symptoms, psychosis, hypoventilation, severe orofacial dyskinesias, and bizarre immunotherapy-resistant involuntary movements that lasted 1 to 12 months. Two patients required mechanical ventilation for 6 and 9 months. Initial tests were normal or unrevealing, including the presence of nonspecific CSF pleocytosis, and normal or mild changes in brain MRI. Eventually, all patients had dramatic recovery of cognitive functions, although one had bilateral leg amputation due to systemic complications. Antibodies to NR1/NR2 heteromers were found in archived serum or CSF but not in long-term follow-up samples. An ovarian teratoma was subsequently demonstrated in three patients (all confirmed pathologically). 1) These findings indicate that ""juvenile acute nonherpetic encephalitis"" or a subset of this disorder is mediated by an antibody-associated immune response against NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). 2) Our patients' clinical features emphasize that anti-NMDAR encephalitis is severe but potentially reversible and may precede by years the detection of an ovarian teratoma. 3) Although recovery may occur without tumor removal, the severity and extended duration of symptoms support tumor removal.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neurology,10.1212/01.wnl.0000278388.90370.c3,PMC2586938,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng

He had a history of chronic atrial fibrillation for which he was implanted with a cardiac pacemaker not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. He also received adjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer. As the involuntary movements interfered with his daily life, the patient elected for neurosurgical treatment despite having terminal cancer. Although the prognosis for pancreatic cancer was considered to be more than 6 months at the time of surgery, we performed CT-guided Vim thalamotomy under local anesthesia without pulse generator implantation considering the patient's general condition. The involuntary movements of the left side of the body reduced following surgery, thus improving his quality of life (QOL). However, 6 months after thalamotomy, the patient died of pancreatic cancer. Thalamotomy significantly reduced the involuntary movements immediately after the procedure. Therefore, thalamotomy can be performed under local anesthesia without the use of any device and may contribute to the improvement of QOL in terminal patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_618_2022,PMC9610373,Functional neurosurgery; Holmes tremor; Palliative care; Radiofrequency; Thalamotomy,Case Reports,United States,eng

Serotonin syndrome is a toxidrome characterized by altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. It is mostly caused by medications that increase serotonin and is rarely reported as a manifestation of neuropsychiatric lupus. We presented the case of a 24-year-old Taiwanese woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosed at 21 years of age. The initial clinical and laboratory presentations upon diagnosis included fever, arthritis, hypocomplementemia, positive antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and anti-ribosomal P antibody. Her condition once remained stable under oral glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, but she developed sudden-onset consciousness disturbance, incoherent speech, and unsteady gait ten days before our assessment. A high fever of up to 39 °C with tremor and clonus occurred at the intensive care unit. Brain MRI revealed symmetric T2 hyperintensity without diffusion restriction over the bilateral globus pallidus. High-dose pulse glucocorticoid and rituximab were prescribed during her admission and the neuropsychiatric symptoms diminished upon treatment. No alternation in mental status or involuntary movements were noted at follow-up.

21621427,A case of hypocalcemia-related epilepsia partialis continua.,"Belluzzo, M; Monti, F; Pizzolato, G",Belluzzo,"Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is a syndrome clinically defined as continuous spontaneous jerking confined to one part of the body, sometimes aggravated by action or sensory stimuli, occurring over hours, days or even years. In adults the more frequent recognized cause of EPC is an acute cerebrovascular disease. Acute severe hypocalcemia is a highly epileptogenic ionic disturbance, abnormally increasing neuronal excitability. In this short communication we describe the first probable case of acute hypocalcemia-related EPC. Eight months after a left parietal lobe cardioembolic stroke, a 74-year-old woman experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure for the first time in her life, at the beginning of a Clostridium difficile enterocolitis. Four days later, while the abdominal symptoms were clinically improving, continuous semi-rhythmic jerks of right face, shoulder and arm began suddenly. Despite several appropriated antiepileptic treatments those involuntary movements did not cease. On routine biochemical examination we noted a total calcium serum level of 1.2 mmol/L (normal range 2.1-2.8 mmol/L), not previously known. After intravenous calcium gluconate supplementation, the jerks started to fade, disappearing completely as a total calcium serum level of 1.9 mmol/L was reached. Two separated CT brain scans did not reveal new cerebral lesions. Neurophysiological studies did not show any cortical activity related to jerks. Taken together, the treatment refractoriness and the clinical improvement after ionic imbalance correction point towards a highly possible role of hypocalcemia in sustaining the activity of a previously silent epileptogenic focus.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Seizure,10.1016/j.seizure.2011.04.013,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Neuroimaging revealed a space-occupying lesion suggestive of low-grade glioma in the right superior frontal cortex and left-sided caudate atrophy as well. Possibly, space-occupying lesion in motor cortex acted as an inciting factor for seizures and non-ketotic hyperglycemia further lowered the seizures threshold. On the other hand, atrophied left caudate had led to persistent choreiform movements secondary to chronic uncontrolled hyperglycemia.

Temporal lobe epilepsy, being the most common focal epilepsy, may ultimately require temporal lobectomy. This is a case report of a 36-year-old male with drug-resistant right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who failed to obtain seizure control after stereotactic radiosurgery to the seizure focus. Complex-partial seizures occurred 6-7 times monthly, and consisted of a loss of awareness followed by involuntary movements of the right arm. EEG/CC TV monitoring indicated a right mesial temporal lobe focus, which was corroborated by decreased uptake in the right temporal lobe by FDG-PET and by MRI findings of right hippocampal sclerosis. Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed with a 4MV linac, utilizing three isocenters with collimator sizes of 10, 10, and 7 mm respectively. A dose of 1500 cGy (max dose 2535 cGy) was delivered in a single fraction to the patient's right amygdala and hippocampus. There were no acute complications. Following radiosurgery the patient's seizures were improved in both frequency and intensity for approximately 3 months. Antiepileptic medications were continued. Thereafter, seizures increased in both frequency and intensity, occurring 10-20 times monthly. At 1 year post radiosurgery, standard right temporal lobectomy including amygdalohippocampectomy was performed with subsequent resolution of complex-partial seizures. Histopathology of the resected temporal lobe revealed hippocampal cell loss and fibrillary astrocytosis, consistent with hippocampal sclerosis. No radiation-induced histopathologic changes were seen. We conclude that low-dose radiosurgery doses temporarily changed the intensity and character of seizure activity, but actually increased seizure activity long-term. If radiosurgery is to be an effective alternative to temporal lobectomy for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, higher radiosurgery doses will be required. The toxicity and efficacy of higher-dose radiosurgery is currently under investigation.",{},,Seizure,10.1053/seiz.2001.0519,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

On admission, choreic involuntary movements were severe in the right extremities and slight in the left extremities. Urine ketone bodies were negative, but HbA1c had elevated to 11.7%. Although a brain CT did not detect any abnormal density areas, we suspected that the patient had cerebral infarction of the basal ganglia or the parietal lobe on the left side, or of the subthalamic nucleus on the right side because choreic involuntary movements were more prominent on the right side. Anti-platelet therapy was performed, but the involuntary movements persisted. A T1-weighted image of brain MRI, performed on the 4th day after hospitalization, detected abnormal high intensity areas in the bilateral putamens. The abnormal area in the left putamen was more prominent. This MRI finding was consistent with that of diabetic chorea-ballism. Surface electromyography demonstrated the simultaneous appearance of grouping discharges in the biceps and triceps muscles of the right arm. We diagnosed the patient as having diabetic chorea based on the MRI findings, and discontinued anti-platelet therapy. MRI should be performed as soon as possible in diabetic patients with acute-onset chorea-ballism which occurs on one side or predominantly on one side in order to differentiate diabetic chorea-ballism from cerebral infarction.",{},,Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.

10996915,[Bilateral anterior operculum syndrome].,"Billeth, R; Jörgler, E; Baumhackl, U",Billeth,"Characteristically, patients with anterior operculum syndrome (AOS), also known as Marie-Foix-Chavany syndrome cannot perform voluntary movements of the face, jaw, tongue, and pharynx. As a result, they are unable to speak, swallow, grimace, smile, or carry out any other voluntary facial masticatory or linguopharyngeal movement. At the same time, involuntary movements of the aforementioned muscles are fully preserved. Laughing, yawning, and coughing, as well as mimicking movements accompanying emotions, eye closure during sleep, or the blink reflex are unaffected. The pathoanatomic substrate of this voluntary-involuntary dissociation is a bilateral lesion of the frontoparietal operculum usually caused by ischemic strokes. The prognosis is usually poor, especially concerning the ability to speak and eat. The name Marie-Foix-Chavany for this syndrome is fully established, although the characteristic voluntary-involuntary dissociation is not mentioned in the original French publication of 1926. We present a case and discuss clinical features, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of AOS.

The patient had hemichorea which was frequently followed by purposeful movement such as fumbling with his glasses or combing his hair. He claimed that the involuntary movements were habits showing both inattention and denial of the involuntary movements. These symptoms were very unique. On MRI of the brain, T2 elongated spots were detected at the bilateral pallidum, suggesting occulusive cerebrovascular disease. On 123I-IMP-SPECT hypoperfusion was observed at the right cerebral basal ganglia extending to the right medial frontal lobe.

Clinically, it presents as ipsilateral oculomotor palsy and specific contralateral involuntary movement. These involuntary movements may affect activities of daily living(ADLs)in affected patients. We treated a case of Benedikt syndrome associated with neck clipping of a ruptured basilar-superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. A 66-year-old female patient was admitted to our department with headache. Initial computed tomography imaging and angiography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage and left basilar-superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. We performed neck clipping of the aneurysm. Immediately after the surgery, left oculomotor nerve palsy occurred. Right involuntary movement gradually developed from the fifth day after the surgery. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)showed an infarction around the left red nucleus. This specific involuntary movement significantly impaired the ADLs of the patient and persisted for two months. From three months after the surgery, it gradually improved. One and a half years after the surgery, the ADLs of the patient improved notably. It is important to preserve perforators in the treatment of distal basilar artery aneurysm.

The Patient reported an immediate disappearance of articulation difficulties, left arm movement, and cervical and neck pain. After discontinuing Sulpiride the patient did not develop such attacks anymore and could be discharged the next day. This case shows the development of dystonia in correlation to the use of Sulpiride, which involved the cervical region, the laryngeal muscles, and the left upper extremity.

Neuroradiological examination in patients with hepatic encephalopathy often shows abnormal signals in multiple regions of the brain, such as the pallidum, putamen, caudate nucleus, hemispheric white matter, and ventral midbrain. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and CAHD is poorly understood and the response to conventional therapies is often poor. We report a male patient with cirrhosis of unknown cause, who developed slowly progressive cerebellar truncal and limb ataxia and slurred speech. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed focal T2 hyperintensity in bilateral dentate nuclei and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCPs). After treatment by obliteration of the portosystemic shunt, clinical manifestations and MRI abnormalities were dramatically improved. He was followed for six years until he died of uncontrollable bleeding due to hepatocellular carcinoma. At the last examination 9 months before death, he showed no apparent aggravation of neurological symptoms, and no abnormal signal intensities in the MCPs and supratentorial compartment.

We report a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A 20-year-old female presented to the ED with behavioral changes, involuntary movements, tachycardia, and alternating obtundation with agitation which progressed over 3 weeks. Involuntary movements were severe, requiring intubation and sedation for control, and were accompanied by rhabdomyolysis. Brain MRI showed bilateral mesiotemporal T2/FLAIR hyperintensities. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were present in the serum (1:640) and CSF (1:320). Malignancy screening revealed a renal mass concerning for RCC, which was confirmed upon resection. She was started on high dose IV methylprednisolone and plasmapheresis, followed by rituximab. Lack of response led to escalating immunotherapy with cyclophosphamide. Clinical course was complicated by prolonged ICU admission, prolonged sedation, severe dysautonomia and bacteremia. Improvement began 2 months after immunotherapy, and she was discharged to rehabilitation 100 days after admission with mild neuropsychiatric symptoms. Repeat malignancy screenings, including whole-body imaging and transvaginal ultrasound were consistently negative. Herein, we describe a case of definite anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the setting of newly diagnosed RCC.

Following this episode, he presented a severe parkinsonian syndrome which was associated, after a few years, with an axial dystonia and stereotyped involuntary movements of the upper limbs. These abnormal movements were particular by their coordinated appearance, their rhythmicity and their relative slowness. Treatment with L-dopa suppressed all akinetic, dystonic and dyskinetic symptoms. At age of 40 years, all the akinetic, dystonic and dyskinetic symptoms reappeared after drug withdrawal. Cerebral computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were normal. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography revealed a significant bilateral reduction of tracer accumulation in the posterior part of both putamen, similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In this patient, pharmacological tests revealed that effectiveness of L-dopa was abolished by administration of a D2 antagonist, and was fully reproduced by a D2 agonist. Clinical signs, pharmacological data and past-medical history strongly suggested a limited lesion of the zona compacta of substantia nigra induced by viral agression. This complex and progressive extrapyramidal syndrome had strong similarities with the lethargic encephalitis of Von Economo and its late symptoms. Other diseases associating akinesia and dyskinesia or dystonic phenomena, like dopa-sensitive dystonia and juvenile Parkinson's disease, are very unlikely.

Although persistent involuntary movements caused by cerebrovascular diseases mostly in middle-aged patients are well known, transient involuntary movements are an unusual manifestation of cerebrovascular diseases. We describe a rare case of reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) presented as hemiballism. A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for hemiballism in the right limbs. On magnetic resonance (MR) imagings, there was no evidence of acute ischemic stroke, but MR angiography revealed severe stenosis of left middle cerebral artery.

For hemiballism, chlorpromazine and haloperidol were administered in addition to antiplatelet management for ischemic attack, and the patient completely recovered on the 5 days of hospitalization. Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or RIND typically present with neurological deficits such as loss of muscle power, reduced sensation, or visual loss. Involuntary movements are not generally regarded to be TIA or RIND. Involuntary movements such as hemiballism, however, can occur as a symptom of TIA or RIND, which should be recognized and differentiated from conditions like partial seizures. Moreover, they may be an indicator of severe carotid stenotic or occlusive diseases, and patients may be at high risk of ischemic events. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are required to prevent ischemic events.",{},,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

In the present paper we report on the case of a 43-year-old diabetic hypertensive man who developed an incomplete form of the Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. Whenever he lay down or withdrew the leg from the ground, he experienced the illusion that the left intermediate toes painfully twisted and mounted each other. Conversely, as he stood up or firm pressure was artificially exerted against the sole, there was a dramatic relief from the ""cramp"" whose illusory character could he be certain of only by looking down at the foot. By passively moving his toes into the referred position we realized that the experienced deformity conformed to the pattern of a fixed dystonia not outwardly expressed through the motor system. There was severe proprioceptive loss in the same toes that harbored the cramp. MRI showed the appropriate lesion in the posteroventrolateral thalamus (VPL) and wallerian degeneration of thalamo-cortical projections. SPECT showed hypoperfusion of the overlying ipsilateral parietal cortex as well as of the basal nuclei bilaterally, besides the expected image of thalamic exclusion. We hypothesize that the infarct disconnected the somatic sensory cortex (S-1) from critical proprioceptive input with relative sparing of superficial sensibility. Lifting the foot deprived S-1 of tonic inputs conveyed by undamaged contact-pressure pathways, a functional effect promptly reversed by placing the foot back against the ground. The case illustrates how a capricious deafferentation of S-1 by a discrete VPL thalamic infarct might facilitate the emergence of autochthonous activity.",{},,Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,10.1590/s0004-282x1996000300020,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,por

When he was brought to the hospital, he was lethargic but could follow simple verbal commands. Frequent involuntary movements manifested by facial grimacings, limb spasms and twitchings with dystonic features were seen. Decorticate posturing was readily elicited by painful stimuli. There was no meningeal irritation sign or gross sensory impairment. The deep tendon reflexes were symmetrically exaggerated with bilateral Babinski signs. Bilateral lateral rectus muscle weakness was found together with mild ptosis and upward gaze limitation. Nystagmus was not present and the funduscopic examination was normal. Immediately he was placed on anticonvulsants, steroid hormone, gamma-globulin and antibiotics as well. A brain CT scan and a CSF examination revealed no abnormality. Meanwhile he continued to show a progressive deterioration associated with fever and status epilepticus, and within 24 hours he lapsed into coma in decorticate posture.

He had a ten-years' history of hypertension and at age 57 had been diagnosed as having asymptomatic multiple cerebral infarcts. Until admission, he was taking antiplatelet drugs for the purpose of preventing thrombotic stroke. On neurological examination, he showed mild impairment of higher brain function, Horner's sign in the left eye, and typical ballism in the right lower extremity. Involuntary movements were never observed in the face and the other extremities. Surface electromyography also showed reciprocal burst discharges at about 1 Hz related to the ballistic movements in the right lower extremity. CT scan revealed a high density lesion surrounded by a low density in the left subthalamic area. MRI examination demonstrated a dumbbell shaped hemorrhage extending from the left subthalamic nucleus to the dorsomedial nucleus of the ipsilateral thalamus. Adding to the hemorrhage, many ischemic lesions were observed in the bilateral basal ganglia and thalamus including the left pallidum. The causal end of the hemorrhage apparently located in the anterior dorsomedial portion of the subthalamic nucleus. There were few reports concerning monoballism, especially monoballism limited to the lower extremity. Recent researches indicate that a subthalamic lesion reduces the excitatory control from the subthalamus to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, which leads to a disinhibition of the thalamus and gives rise to ballism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
7994988,[Involuntary movements caused by thalamic lesion].,"Moroo, I; Hirayama, K; Kojima, S",Moroo,"We described two types of involuntary movement accompanied with a well-located thalmaic lesion shown by MR imaging in five patients. All patients had the involuntary movements of an upper limb contralateral to the thalamic lesion. Two patients (1 and 2) had choreoathetosis that became most prominent when their index finger approached their nose, where irregular and dysynchronous oscillation occasionally superimposed. This choreoathetosis was differentiated from pseudoathetosis caused by disturbance of proprioceptive sensations. The MRI lesion was located at the middle level of thalamus including nucleus centromedianus. The other three patients (3, 4 and 5) had a regular and rhythmic oscillation in their forearm. The oscillation began to appear after their index finger reached their nose on finger-to-nose test. We considered the oscillation as a postural tremor based on its rhythmicity and regularity. Patient 4 had additional tremor in movement. Their postural tremor continued while the arm kept the position. Surface electromyogram showed the reciprocal discharges between the forearm extensor and flexor muscles with a frequency of 3 to 4 Hz. This tremor was not accentuated during limb movement toward the nose nor was coarse, and was distinguished from intention tremor described by Charcot and Dejerine. This tremor was also different from hyperkinesis volitionnelle and movement oppositionist. The ""rubral tremor"" differed from the tremor shown in our cases for a lack of resting tremor. The responsible lesion shown by MRI located at caudal posterior thalamus including pulvinar in patient 3, or located at the upper level of thalamus in patient 4 and case 5 that was more rostral than the lesion of the choreoathetosis cases. In cases of cerebrovascular accidents, both types of involuntary movement appeared after several months from the stroke. This delayed appearance suggests that these involuntary movements were the result not only of functional disturbance of thalamus, but of secondary repairing mechanism occurring at the lesion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Here we report a 55-year-old female, from Sri Lanka, who presented with involuntary movements of the left upper and lower limbs. Her past medical history included diabetes mellitus and she was on warfarin 5 mg daily for a mechanical mitral and tricuspid valve replacement. The random blood sugar on admission was 462 mg/dL and the last INR was 3.03. While hemiballismus has multiple etiologies, intracranial hemorrhage would be the main differential in a patient on anticoagulation. Other differentials include drug-induced dyskinesia, metabolic abnormalities, and autoimmune etiologies. Hemiballismus in the presence of high blood glucose should always raise the suspicion of diabetic striatopathy. The non-contrast computed tomography of the brain showed hyperdensity in the right-side caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, and globus pallidus which is a characteristic of diabetic striatopathy but could have been mistaken for an intracranial hemorrhage. The involuntary movements improved with glucose control and treatment with clonazepam and tetrabenazine. This case highlights the potential for misdiagnosis of diabetic striatopathy as an intracranial hemorrhage in a patient on warfarin, which can lead to delays in appropriate management and erroneous omission of warfarin. Early recognition and treatment of diabetic striatopathy can lead to significant improvement in the quality of life.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,SAGE open medical case reports,10.1177/2050313X231222203,PMC10768625,Hemichorea-hemiballismus; diabetic striatopathy; involuntary movements of limbs,Case Reports,England,eng

The benefit may be adjunctive or alternative to current invasive treatments of movement disorders after brain injury and merits confirmation. The improvements are consistent with current research indicating that (1) intact cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and spinal areas interact to generate bilateral rhythmic limb movements that can overcome dyskinesia and (2) tactile stimulation can improve motor deficits associated with basal ganglia disorders.

We describe a 22-year-old woman with EPC manifesting with isolated toe movements, prevalent over the left side and initially misdiagnosed as psychogenic, clinically almost indistinguishable from those observed in ""painful legs and moving toes syndrome"". The continuous involuntary movements with EMG correlates of twitches lasting <100 ms, the sharp waves over fronto-central regions on EEG, and the marked asymmetry in somatosensory evoked potentials with higher cortical amplitude over the right side following peripheral stimulation over the left foot confirmed the epileptic nature of the symptoms, leading to the diagnosis of EPC. The toe movements were markedly reduced following steroid therapy, whereas the infusion of immunoglobulins caused aseptic meningitis. Despite an extensive diagnostic work-up (including a search for antibodies for paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis), an ultimate aetiological diagnosis was not reached, although the dramatic response to corticosteroids strongly supported an underlying dysimmune pathophysiology. Diagnosing EPC can be challenging, especially if movements are confined to a very small body region or strongly resemble movements encountered in other conditions. EEG-EMG monitoring should be performed in patients with continuous involuntary muscular jerks in order not to overlook a diagnosis of EPC.

This 51-year-old malnourished and chronic alcoholic man presented with progressive mental deterioration, pellagra dermatitis, hypertonus of the neck and other musculatures, myoclonic jerks with bizarre involuntary movements, in addition to total external ophthalmoplegia and gait disturbance. After administration of multivitamins, including thiamine and nicotinamide, these neurologic abnormalities were dramatically improved in a few days. However, the patient died thereafter because of sepsis associated with pneumonia. Postmortem examination revealed marked abnormalities in CNS, characterized by diffuse atrophy of gray matter and widespread neuronal degeneration and characteristic central chromatolysis in pontine nuclei, dentate nuclei, cranial nerve nuclei in the brain stem, Betz cells of the cerebral cortex, and Clarke's column and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. There were also atrophy and gliosis of the mammillary bodies, degeneration and vascular proliferation of periaqueductal gray matter, and massive gliosis around the third ventricle. These neuropathological changes were compatible with symptoms of both alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy and Wernicke's disease, but they were also strongly suspected on clinical grounds.",{},,Journal of Korean medical science,10.3346/jkms.1991.6.1.87,PMC3049671,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Korea (South),eng

29310343,Cerebrospinal fluid real-time quaking-induced conversion test for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in an 18-year-old woman: A case report.,"Yao, Yuan; Dong, Xiaoping; Guan, Hongzhi; Lu, Qiang",Yao,"Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) mainly occurs in the elderly, with the peak age of onset ranging from 55 to 75 years. The symptoms of sCJD are not unique, and laboratory tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)14-3-3 protein have low sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, excluding treatable diseases and establishing a diagnosis could be difficult in young patients with suspected sCJD. Recently, real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) has been used in the diagnosis of sCJD, with more than 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We report the case of an 18-year-old woman presented with cerebellar ataxia, blurred vision, rapidly progressive dementia, tremor and involuntary movements, urinary incontinence, mutism, and eventually myoclonus for 16 weeks. Brain MRI scans were unremarkable at the 4th and 8th week after initial symptom presentation, but showed hyperintensity in bilateral basal ganglia and cortical ribboning at the 16th week. Typical periodic bilateral triphasic sharp wave complexes on EEG did not appear until the 16th week after initial symptom presentation. Due to the young age of the patient and the originally unremarkable MRI and EEG findings, we first considered treatable diseases such as autoimmune encephalitis, infections, organic acidemias and toxication. However, extensive tests ruled out these diseases. When she was finally diagnosed with probable sCJD, we were unable to perform a brain biopsy. We confirmed the diagnosis by detecting the scrapie form of prion protein in the CSF using RT-QuIC. Experimental treatments with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and ganciclovir were given. Experimental treatments were ineffective. The patient's parents discharged her from our clinic. We present a case of probable sCJD with an early onset and a complex clinical picture confirmed by RT-QuIC. This case report suggests that RT-QuIC has great value for the diagnosis of atypical cases.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000008699,PMC5728744,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Serious and potentially fatal problems included epilepsia partialis continua, partial and generalized seizures, and respiratory depression, resembling the symptoms of encephalitis lethargica. An epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, also known of Economo encephalitis, occurred around 1917.

Despite the severity of the symptoms, the patient showed significant neurological improvement following removal of the tumor and chemotherapy. This case suggests that physicians should rule out an OT in young women with encephalitis who present with the subacute-onset of psychiatric symptoms.

She became alert in two weeks, though weakness and atrophy remained in the upper limb muscles. She was diagnosed as Russian spring summer encephalitis (RSSE) based on several serological studies. Three kinds of involuntary movements were noted after recovery. These were spontaneous muscle jerks in the left arm, action tremor in the right arm and pathological associated-movement in the right leg. The movements were studied physiologically by electroencephalogram (EEG)-electromyogram (EMG) polygraphic recordings, jerk-locked averaging (JLA), magnetencephalography (MEG), and sensory evoked potentials (SEPs). The jerky movements in her left arm were observed at rest and aggravated by emotional stress. EEG-EMG polygraph showed that the jerks were sometimes associated with small spikes thus were considered to be due to epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). JLA analysis revealed a pre-myoclonus spike on the right hemisphere which preceded the onset of the jerk in the left first dorsal interosseous muscle by 25.2ms, which was equal to the magnetic cortical latency of that muscle. Jerk-locked magnetic field, obtained by averaging neuromagnetic activities with respect to the onset of myoclonus, showed that the spike preceding the jerk, originated from the right motor cortex. The spontaneous spikes were localized mainly on the right motor cortex. Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were normal in both size and latency. No hyperexcitability of the sensory cortex was demonstrated even by using paired stimulation SEPs. Based on these results, we conclude that the jerky movements in this patient were produced by abnormal spontaneous discharges in the motor cortex. The action tremor had a frequency of 4-5 Hz and its clinical features were compatible with cerebellar tremor. This is thought to result from a lesion in the left thalamus, affecting the cerebellothalamic pathways. Her right leg unintentionally moved whenever she began to move the hands.

Neurological examination revealed total ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and areflexia. Muscle weakness in four limbs was also noted. We diagnosed the patient as having an overlap between Fisher's syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome. On day 5, she suddenly had flinging involuntary movements affecting the face and four extremities. Surface EMG recording revealed 1.5- 2 Hz rhythmic grouping discharges. The involuntary movements were considered as ballism. Brain CT and MRI could not detect any abnormal findings in subthalamic nucleus, but, electrophysiological findings revealed CNS lesions. Therefore, the clinical diagnosis also were Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. She had high titer of IgG antibody to GQ 1b (1:64,000). Sera taken from patients with Fisher's syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome with ophthalmoparesis and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis during the acute phases of these syndromes frequently have IgG antibody to GQ 1b ganglioside. It is concluded that some cases of acute ophthalmoparesis subsequent to infection or immunization may be categorized as autoimmune diseases. Hence, such disease which show external ophthalmoparesis may be designated the ""anti-GQ 1 b IgG antibody syndrome"".

Admission to our department for investigation of her abnormal behavior revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positivity for anti-NMDAR antibodies, and the patient underwent immunotherapy. However, generalized tonic seizures developed, requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Antipsychotic drugs were also administered for involuntary movements and insomnia. Thereafter, a malignant syndrome of severe hyperCKemia (Max: 191,120 IU/L) and shock developed, requiring resuscitation and three sessions of hemodialysis. Subsequent rituximab therapy led to improvement, except for mutism, which had newly developed during resuscitation. Seven months after initial admission, the patient was discharged with independent gait. However, her mutism still persists. Temporary mutism has been reported to occur in this type of encephalitis, albeit rarely. The fact that remission was not observed in this case may have been due to cerebellar infarction occurring during resuscitation, but the true cause remains unclear. Malignant syndrome or rhabdomyolysis, as seen in this patient, has also sometimes been reported in this form of encephalitis when antipsychotic agents, especially dopamine receptor blockers, have been administered. Therefore, such agents should be administered with caution in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

The EEG showed patterns typical of cerebral ischemia during the syncope and epileptogenic foci in both temporal lobes after sleep deprivation. It is difficult to distinguish between seizure and syncope associated with involuntary movements when making a differential diagnosis. We hypothesize that the frequent self-induced ischemic insult to the brain caused a cicatrix to develop, which in turn caused the frequent seizure disorder; and that because this ischemia functioned as a stimulus to the reward site in the limbic system, the patient repeatedly induced it.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1983.04050120070012,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Case report].,"Fiszer, U; Cichy, S; Zaborski, J; Pastuszko, M; Członkowska, A",Fiszer,"The involuntary movements of choreoathetotic type are commonly regarded as a sign of basal ganglia lesion. However, such movements can also occur in pathological processes involving the cervical spinal cord. This condition is referred to as pseudochoreoathetosis. Involuntary movements can be related to lack of proper coordination between agonist and antagonist muscles, their simultaneous activation due to impairment of reciprocal inhibition. The characteristic feature of pseudochoreoathetosis is proprioceptive sensory loss. In this paper we present 4 patients who developed various involuntary limb movements in early stage of the disease. Lesions in the cervical spinal cord were confirmed by MRI. In case 1 the cause was astrocytoma, in cases 2 and 3--demyelination, in case 4 the precise character of the lesion could not be established. Pseudochoreoathetosis is a rare condition which often remains unrecognized.

However, T2-weighted MRI revealed the high signal spreading over the bilateral splenia of the corpus callosum, while enhanced effects were not observed by Gd contrast on T1-weighted MRI. Diffusion and FLAIR MRI also showed the high signals limited to the same part of the splenia bilaterally as on T2-weighted MRI, discriminating it from other lacunar lesions and old cerebral infarctions. Neurological features, which were considered to be directly associated with the fresh lesion, were impairment of verbal and visual memories. Near the time the therapies including high-dose steroid were given, the consciousness of the patient worsened rapidly on a day-to-day basis and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) also occurred. By administering low-molecule heparin, consciousness disturbance and involuntary movements recovered completely. Following the improved symptoms, FLAIR MRI showed a reduced level of the signal seven months after the onset.

It is produced by bilateral involvement of the anterior or frontal opercular region. In adults it is related to ischemic lesions. In childhood it presents congenitally in perisylvian dysplasias and as an acquired disorder in encephalitis or can be episodic in symptomatic or idiopathic epilepsies such as benign rolandic epilepsy. A 13-year-old patient who presented, over five straight days, four episodes of facial dysplegia, anarthria, dysphagia, drooling, paralysis of the upper limbs, while involuntary facial expression was normal and the corneal, cough and gag reflexes were preserved. The first three come to an end spontaneously at 2, 4 and 20 hours, respectively; the fourth episode concluded an hour and a half after onset, following administration of intravenous phenytoin for 5 minutes. Computerised axial tomography and magnetic resonance images of the brain, as well as the interictal electroencephalograms (EEG), were normal. Administration of oxcarbazepine was started but at 8 months was stopped after a normal EEG during nocturnal sleep was obtained. After 15 months, the patient has not presented any more episodes. The paroxysmal character of the disorder together with normal interictal periods, the normality of the neuroimages, and the speedy recovery achieved after the administration of phenytoin support the notion of an epileptic origin.

Propofol/remifentanil general anesthesia was induced. Following craniotomy, anesthetic administrations ceased. The level of consciousness was sufficient and she was not agitated. However, the patient complained of nausea 70 minutes into the awake phase. Considering the adverse effects of antiemetics and the upcoming surgical strategy, we did not give any medications. Nausea disappeared spontaneously while the operation was suspended. When surgical intervention extended to the left caudate nucleus, involuntary movement, classified as a tremor, with 5-6 Hz frequency, abruptly occurred on her left forearm. The patient showed emotional distress. Tremor appeared on her right forearm and subsequently spread to her lower extremities. Intravenous midazolam and fentanyl could not reduce her psychological stress. Since the tremor disturbed microscopic observation, general anesthesia was induced. Consequently, the tremor disappeared and did not recur. Based on the anatomical ground and the medication status, her involuntary movement was diagnosed as psychogenic tremor. Various factors can induce involuntary movements. In fact, intraoperative management of nausea and vomiting takes priority during awake craniotomy, but we should be reminded that some antiemetics potentially induce involuntary movement that could be caused by surgery around basal ganglia.",{},,Masui.

Neuropathological examination reveals neuronal loss, gliosis and swollen achromatic neurons within the frontal and temporal cortices, and the substantia nigra. We discuss here a unique phenomenon not described so far in three patients with clinical features of CBD, one with subsequent autopsy observations. When awake, they all showed a common behavior, their mouth opened constantly and immediately, when a tongue-depresser was approached in front of it by the examiner. In two of them, their mouth also opened when its corner was stroked by a tongue-depressor. They could not control these phenomena at all, even they were asked not to open their mouth. We would like to call these phenomena ""forced mouth opening reactions"" because they were uncontrollable voluntarily. They may be divided into two groups, i.e. visual and tactile ""forced mouth opening reactions"". In all the patients the neurological, neuro-imaging and neuropathological data showed that the frontal lobes were damaged. Additionally, they had some frontal lobe release signs such as forced grasping, forced groping, or alien limb sign. We would like to apply the mechanism for these release signs to the ""forced mouth opening reactions"". Thus, we speculate that the frontal lobe contains a higher motor control mechanism for normal mouth opening movement, and the ""forced mouth opening reactions"" result from impairment of this control.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
7280438,[Obsessional-type compulsive behavior caused by bilateral circumscribed pallidostriatal necrosis. Encephalopathy caused by a wasp sting].,"Laplane, D; Widlocher, D; Pillon, B; Baulac, M; Binoux, F",Laplane,"A previously healthy young man developed encephalopathy after a wasp sting in 1968. Neurological complications included chorea, currently of a minor degree, replaced by buccofacial dyskinesias and compulsive movements. The most disabling consequences were of psychic nature, the patient presenting an unusually marked compulsive activity of an obsessional type. The whole psychic picture however was quite different from that of the usual neurosis, since there was neither anxiety nor doubt, but a mental vacuum contrasting with almost normal intellectual and affective capacities. It was as though there was a loss of the auto-activation system of psychic life, postulated by dynamic psychologists. C.A.T. demonstrated bilateral pallidostriatal necrosis. This suggests that the striatum plays a motor and psychic role. In the field of motor control, its hypoactivity appears to determine not only chorea but dyskinesias similar to tics and compulsive movements. In the psychic field, the striatum appears to play the very general role of an auto-activation system of intellectual and affective life, its deficiency leading to mental activity of a compulsive nature. Improvement in knowledge of striatal biology should clarify not only the basic mechanisms of chorea, but those of tics and obsessions.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
8365067,[Hemiballism-hemichorea caused by a putaminal hemorrhage with worsening after smoking--a case report].,"Mochizuki, H; Miwa, H; Imai, H; Muzuno, Y",Mochizuki,"A 65-year-old hypertensive man was admitted because of abnormal involuntary movements which had an onset one month prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed an alert and intelligent male in no acute distress. Cranial nerves appeared intact except for dysarthria. His gait was wide-based. He had hemiballism-hemichorea in his left upper and lower extremities. Cranial CT scans revealed a high density area confined to the right putamen. After admission, his involuntary movements slowly improved without medication. After near complete disappearance of his abnormal movements two weeks after admission, he noted that smoking induced choreic movement in his left side transiently. The involuntary movement ceased soon after upon stopping smoking. This was repeatedly observed not only by him but also by us. Our observation may indicate that the inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus as the result of the decrease of the putaminal output to the external segment of the globus pallidus will induce hemiballism. The effect of smoking on his involuntary movements can be understood as a result of increase in the dopamine release from the nigrostriatal terminals induced by nicotine.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
14503357,[A patient with Hashimoto's encephalopathy showing subacute global cognitive dysfunction].,"Hatano, Yasuko; Mori, Hideo; Kakusaka, Kaoru; Kitada, Toru; Urabe, Takao; Mizuno, Yoshikuni",Hatano,"We report a 66-year-old woman with Hashimoto's encephalopathy who showed rapidly developing cognitive deficits, inactivity, and gait disturbance without involuntary movements or convulsions. She had had right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria caused by a lacunar infarction and had been admitted to our hospital for 2 weeks. Although the dysarthria and hemiparesis gradually improved, difficulty in walking, disorientation, and drowsiness developed 2 months after discharge. Upon readmission, the patient was alert but apathetic and sometimes sleepy. The right upper and lower limbs showed mild weakness, which was considered to be due to the previous infarction. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mild elevation of protein without pleocytosis. An electroencephalogram was normal, and a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed only the old lacunar infarction. Titers of antithyroglobulin antibodies and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone in serum were elevated. We made a diagnosis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy and treated the patient with high-dose corticosteroids. Within 1 week, her mental status improved and she was able to walk. Generalized seizure, myoclonus, and tremor, which are characteristic of Hashimoto's encephalopathy, never developed. The findings in this patient suggest that Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a treatable condition, should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn
