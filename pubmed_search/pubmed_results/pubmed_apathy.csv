34765254,Choroid Plexus Papilloma - Case Presentation.,"Kabashi, Antigona; Ahmetgjekaj, Ilir",Kabashi,"Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) according to the latest WHO classification system in 2016 are an uncommon, benign (WHO grade I) neuroepithelial intraventricular tumor derived from choroid plexus epithelium, which can occur in both the pediatric and adult population. These tumors account for approximately 1% of all brain tumor 2-6% of pediatric brain tumors and 0.5% of adult brain tumors. A 2-year-old female is presented at the Pediatrics Clinic at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo in a febrile, lethargic state and the anterior fontanelle is tense and swollen. The patient's parents indicate that symptoms such as food refusal, apathy, speechlessness and low mood were presented a week earlier. Choroid plexus papilloma is a rare tumor without specific clinical patterns or imaging findings. In our presentation we have presented the role of symptoms in the detected and diagnostic of choroid plexus papilloma. Not every headache is a symptom of choroid plexus papilloma.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Current health sciences journal,10.12865/CHSJ.47.02.24,PMC8551882,CT; Choroid plexus papilloma; MRI; choroid papilloma symptoms,Case Reports,Romania,eng

He was found stuporous in the hospital after drinking IPA and admitted to IPA abuse during the preceding weeks. Two other men were admitted in a stupor after large ingestions of IPA. Intoxication with IPA has two different presentations: stupor in a known alcoholic and encephalopathy of unknown cause in individuals who hide their addiction.

Despite extensive research, the exact etiology and pathogenesis of this condition remain unclear. In recent years, autoimmune encephalitis (AE) after viral encephalitis (VE) has gathered significant attention. Here, we present a case report of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy after VE in a 43-year-old Asian male with a history of oral and labial herpes. The patient presented with high-grade fever, headache, urinary retention, unresponsiveness, and apathy. Elevated levels of protein and GFAP-IgG were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed linear enhancement oriented radially to the ventricles. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resulted in symptom relief, reduced lesion enhancement, and decreased protein levels. This case report highlights bimodal encephalitis with no discernible interval between VE and autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy, which poses diagnostic challenges. Notably, autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is a novel form of autoimmune encephalitis, and its treatment lacks sufficient clinical experience. Intriguingly, our patient demonstrated sensitivity to IVIG, a treatment that differed from past reports. Therefore, further exploration of treatment strategies for this condition is warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in immunology,10.3389/fimmu.2023.1258048,PMC10535097,case report; encephalitis; glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); herpes simplex viral encephalitis (HSVE); viral encephalitis (VE),"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng
37323514,Psychiatric Manifestations as the Primary Presentation of Frontal Meningioma.,"Lally, Jill; Galarneau, David",Lally,"<b>Background:</b> Although some patients with primary brain lesions remain clinically asymptomatic, others may experience a range of symptoms, including headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, changes in baseline mental function, and psychiatric manifestations. Distinguishing between a primary psychiatric illness and symptoms of a primary central nervous system tumor can be especially difficult for patients with a history of mental illness. A major challenge in effectively treating patients with brain tumors is first obtaining the diagnosis. <b>Case Report:</b> A 61-year-old female with a medical history significant for bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety, and previous psychiatric hospitalization presented to the emergency department with worsening depressive symptoms and without focal neurologic deficits. She was initially placed on a physician's emergency certificate for grave disability, with anticipated discharge to a local inpatient psychiatric facility once she was stabilized. A frontal brain lesion, concerning for a meningioma, was found on magnetic resonance imaging and she was instead transferred to a tertiary center for urgent neurosurgical consultation. Bifrontal craniotomy with neoplasm excision was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and continued symptom improvement was noted at the patient's 6- and 12-week postoperative visits. <b>Conclusion:</b> This patient's clinical course exemplifies the clinical ambiguity associated with brain tumors, the challenge of obtaining a timely diagnosis with nonspecific symptoms, and the importance of neuroimaging for patients presenting with atypical cognitive symptoms. This case report contributes to the literature about the psychiatric manifestations of brain lesions, especially in patients with concurrent mental health disorders.",{},,Ochsner journal,10.31486/toj.22.0112,PMC10262947,Anxiety; apathy; brain neoplasms; depression; meningioma; neuroimaging,Case Reports,United States,eng

Behcet's disease (BD) can present with heterogeneous neurological manifestations. However, LE is not considered a typical presentation of neuro-Behcet's disease (NBD). A 40-years-old male presented with new-onset subacute headaches, memory problems and apathy. A review of systems revealed an unrecorded past history of recurrent oral sores for years, recent malaise and fever, as well as an episode of bilateral panuveitis four months before presentation. His general and neurologic examination revealed slight fever, an isolated oral aphtha, anterograde amnesia and signs of bilateral retinal vasculitis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging displayed a pattern of limbic meningoencephalitis, and his cerebrospinal fluid showed mononuclear inflammation. The patient met BD diagnostic criteria. Considering LE is a very rare presentation of NBD, alternative etiologies were thoroughly assessed and excluded, including infectious, autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis. Therefore, he was diagnosed with NBD, and he recovered well after immunosuppression. Only two cases of NBD presenting with LE have been previously reported. We report a third case of this rare presentation and compare it with the previous two.

The patient originally presented with headache and bilateral lower extremity weakness. He was found to have a large medial sphenoidal wing meningioma and a small right parietal meningioma. The sphenoidal wing meningioma was removed via craniotomy, but the right parietal meningioma was not resected. In the following years, the patient developed symptoms of mania and psychosis which coincided with an increase in size of the right parietal meningioma.

Case 1 was a 58-year-old woman complaining of sudden headache and vomiting who was diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage. She underwent transcatheter embolization for intracranial aneurysm treatment but had an acute profuse hematochezia on the 11th day of admission. Case 2 was a 63-year-old man admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit because of fever with altered consciousness level for a week. He was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer that had metastasized to multiple organs one month prior. On the third day of admission, he had an attack of profuse hematochezia, and quickly developed shock and apathy. Both patients were diagnosed with actively bleeding rectal Dieulafoy's lesion by bedside emergency colonoscopy. Endoscopic hemostatic clipping was performed in 2 patients.

Alcoholism is the common cause for this disease. A 41 year old man was brought to our emergency department (ED) complaining of confusion. One week earlier he had started to experience severe nausea and vomiting followed by diplopia, dysarthria and also dysphagia. One day later he had experienced gait disturbance and progressive ataxia accompanied with confusion, apathy and disorientation. He had no history of alcoholism, drug abuse or previous surgery but had history of untreated Crohn disease. Just before arrival to our emergency department, he had been hospitalized in another center for about a week but all investigations had failed to provide a conclusive diagnosis. Upon admission to our ED, he was dysarthric and replied with inappropriate answers. On physical examination, bilateral horizontal nystagmus in lateral gaze, left abducens nerve palsy and upward gaze palsy were seen. Gag reflex was absent and plantar reflexes were upwards bilaterally. After reviewing all the previously performed management measures, MRI was performed and was consistent with the diagnosis of WE. Treatment with thiamine led to partial resolution of his upward gaze palsy and nystagmus on the first day. At the end of the third day of treatment, except for gate ataxia, all other symptoms completely resolved and he was fully conscious. After the fifth day his gait became normal and after one week he was discharged in good general condition.

8711991,"Traumatic brain injury, cognitive and emotional dysfunction. Impact of clinical neuropsychology research.","Emilien, G; Waltregny, A",Emilien,"It is well established that head injury often causes brain damage leading to long term physical, cognitive and behavioural changes in the injured patients. Whereas the physical effects ranging from sensori-motor disturbances to posttraumatic epilepsy are often reported as well as cognitive sequelae, deteriorations of emotional and behavioural aspects are often neglected. Recent advances in imaging technology and clinical neuropsychology research have greatly contributed to increase our understanding of the effect of traumatic brain injury on diverse behavioural functions. After a brief review of the current status of problems facing the brain injured patients, this paper discusses the neuropsychological aspects of 3 long term brain injured patients. All 3 patients showed important behavioural and emotional distress several years after the accident. Whereas case report of patient A and C discuss the emotional and personality disturbance characterised by anxiety, depression and irritability, case report of patient C which is a case of classic frontal syndrome showed important memory impairment with emotional disturbance characterised by apathy, lack of motivation and complete indifference to his surrounding environment. Whatever the mechanisms involved, psychoaffective disturbances in the brain injured patients appear as important problems in the long term.

36340934,Right Unilateral Spatial Neglect Improves with Intrinsic Motivation.,"Saito, Hirotaka; Kobayashi, Haruka; Yatsu, Junichi; Obayashi, Shigeru",Saito,"<i>Background</i>. In the acute phase of stroke, it is well known that the incidence and severity of unilateral spatial neglect (USN) are more significant in the right hemisphere injuries. Still, the detection of USN in left hemisphere injuries has been increasing in recent years. This trend is because behavioral assessments have prevented the exclusion of patients who are difficult to assess for USN or apathy using conventional paper-and-pencil tests (e.g., aphasia). Right USN and post-stroke apathy share many common lesions. Therefore, clinical symptoms may overlap, but little validation considers this. <i>Case Study</i>. A man (62 years old) determined to have the right USN and apathy was treated for six weeks in 3 terms. In the first term (weeks 1 to 2), the patient was treated for the right USN by conventional therapy. In the second term (3-4 weeks), treatment for right USN and apathy by goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior was implemented. In the third term (5-6 weeks), goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior was discontinued, and treatment was returned to conventional therapy only. In the second term (goal-directed therapy based on affinity behavior), the improvement in patients' apathy (clinical assessment for spontaneity) was more significant than the effect size in the third term (conventional therapy). There were no significant differences in USN (catherine bergego scale) and intrinsic motivation (pittsburgh rehabilitation participation scale). However, the effect size in the second term tended to be larger than in the third term (conventional therapy). <i>Clinical Rehabilitation Impact</i>. This report aims to demonstrate the limitations of current treatment for cases determined to have both right USN and apathy. Second, to assess the extent to which this new intervention can complement the limitations of current treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2022/4828549,PMC9633176,,Case Reports,United States,eng

This may take the form of a cardiac encephalopathy that shares clinical features with other metabolic encephalopathies. The causes are multiple. There is a particular, previously unreported, syndrome that occasionally develops in some patients with congestive heart failure that resembles the findings in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. This syndrome is characterized by apathy and abulia with preserved alertness; it is caused by fluid retention within the cranial cavity. The syndrome may also develop in patients with other conditions that cause anasarca, e.g., severe liver or kidney disease or hypoalbuminemia. Because patients with these conditions are often quite ill, it has been difficult to verify the pathophysiologic aspects of the syndrome so that its mechanism must remain a hypothesis that awaits more definitive study in a series of patients.

In the classical literature, it was referred to as a lack of mental energy or vitality and attributed to dysfunction of the ergotropic sympathetic pathway involving the posterior hypothalamus, thalamus, cingulate cortex, and hippocampal formation. Recent advanced imaging studies have expanded the ambit of network dysfunction to include the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and the salience network that gauges the valence or energy of the mesolimbic system. The classic Papez circuit also has a role in the pathogenesis of apathy. In order to understand the mechanisms of apathy seen with a wide range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, and strokes, one needs to think of apathy as a network disorder.

Subacute cognitive impairment, movement disorders, late onset epilepsy and neuropsychiatric syndromes were recently linked to paraneoplastic encephalitis. Despite that, probably some syndromes and antibodies are yet to be reported. Herein we reported the clinical and neuroimaging pictures of a patient with late onset medial temporal lobe epilepsy, subtle cognitive impairment, psychosis and severe apathy diagnosed with antibody-negative paraneoplastic encephalitis due to colonic adenocarcinoma. The apathy markedly improved after removal of the tumor, without concomitant immunotherapy (steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, immunosuppressants, plasmapheresis, etc.). Our report highlights the importance of a full clinical and neurologic investigation in cases of atypical neuropsychiatric presentations, particularly in the elderly and with the concomitance of epilepsy and cognitive decline. Even chronic presentations must be considered. Neuroimaging is an important tool to demonstrate structural and functional brain dysfunction in these cases. Colonic adenocarcinoma should be searched for in cases in which a typical tumor related to paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes is not found.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2013.11.038,,Amygdalar enlargement; Apathy; Atypical neuropsychiatric syndromes; Colonic adenocarcinoma; Limbic encephalitis; Paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

At the moment of second hospital admission, the patient was found somnolent and confused at home, with traumatic signs of biting of the tongue and urine emission. A couple days after admission, our patient became alert and presented hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, increased oral tendency, behavior changes including apathy with loss of anger and fear, and a very increased appetite, transient visual agnosia and right-left disorientation. In the initial phase, the patient could not recognize any members of his family, but he had a tendency to touch everything within his reach and place it into his mouth. The KBS presented in this case, following an ischemic stroke of the right temporal lobe provides distinct and intriguing insights into the possible pathophysiology of this syndrome.

Symptoms include apathy, confusion, and neurological deficits. We describe a 47-year-old male patient who inhaled gas from a kitchen stove liquid petroleum gas cylinder. He was diagnosed with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 12 hours after his emergency department admission. He received six sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) and was discharged in a healthy state after six days. Fifteen days later, he experienced weakness, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, depression, balance problems, and inability to perform self-care. One week later, he developed urinary and fecal incontinence and was diagnosed with post-hypoxic encephalopathy. After 45 days from the onset of symptoms, he was referred to the Underwater and Hyperbaric Medicine Department for HBOT. The patient exhibited poor self-care and slow speech rate, as well as ataxic gait and dysdiadochokinesia. Hyperbaric oxygen was administered for twenty-four sessions, which significantly improved the patient's neurological status with only hypoesthesia in the left hand remaining at the end of treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen has been reported as successful in treating some cases of delayed neurological sequelae following CO intoxication. It is possible that HBO therapy may also be effective in delayed post-hypoxic encephalopathy from other causes. This may be achieved through mechanisms such as transfer of functional mitochondria to the injury site, remyelination of damaged neurons, angiogenesis and neurogenesis, production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and balancing of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.",{},,Diving and hyperbaric medicine,10.28920/dhm53.4.351-355,PMC10944663,Brain; Dementia; Hyperbaric medicine; Neurology; Toxicity,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Some cases taking conventional hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy or steroid-pulse therapy may be insufficient, and AchEI may be effective. We report two cases of delayed encephalopathy after acute CO poisoning involving two women aged 69 (Case 1) and 60 years (Case 2) whose cognitive function improved with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchEI) treatment. Delayed encephalopathy occurred 25 and 35 days after acute CO poisoning in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. Both patients demonstrated cognitive impairment, apathy, and hypokinesia on admission. Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not yield any significant improvements, cognitive dysfunction improved substantially. This was evidenced by an improved Mini-Mental State Examination score ffom 9 to 28 points in Case 1 and an improved Hasegawa's dementia rating scale score from 4 to 25 points in Case 2 after administration of an AchEI. In Case 1, we administered galantamine hydrobromide, which was related with improved white matter lesions initially detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. However, in Case 2 white matter lesions persisted despite AchEI treatment. AchEI treatment may result in improved cognitive and frontal lobe function by increasing low acetylcholine concentrations in the hippocampus and frontal lobe caused by decreased nicotinic acetylcholine receptor levels in delayed encephalopathy after CO poisoning.

In the current study, the role of C. perfringens type A in an outbreak of enteritis in calves was studied. Two 20-day-old dairy calves exhibiting apathy and reluctance to eat, with paresis of the anterior limbs, were euthanized for postmortem examination. Gross and histological changes compatible with acute enteritis, rumenitis, meningitis, and pneumonia were seen in both calves.

Abulia is a syndrome characterized by apathy and deficiency of motivated behavior. Abulia is most frequently associated with ACC damage, but also occurs following damage to subcortical nuclei (striatum, globus pallidus, thalamic nuclei). We present resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data from an individual who suffered a stroke leading to abulia. We hypothesized that, although structural imaging revealed no damage to the patient's ACC, fcMRI would uncover aberrant function in this region and in the relevant cortical networks. Resting state correlations in the patient's gray matter were compared to those of age-matched controls. Using a novel method to identify abnormal patterns of functional connectivity in single subjects, we identified areas and networks with aberrant connectivity. Networks associated with memory (default mode network) and executive function (cingulo-opercular network) were abnormal. The patient's anterior cingulate was among the areas showing aberrant functional connectivity. In a rescan 3 years later, deficits remained stable and fcMRI findings were replicated. These findings suggest that the aberrant functional connectivity mapping approach described may be useful for linking stroke symptoms to disrupted network connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,NeuroImage.

Such behavioral disorders have been termed psychic akinesia or athymhormia syndrome, suggesting that the patients suffered from a loss of drive and motivation. The lesions involved bilaterally the globus pallidus, the striatum or the frontal lobe. Recently, anatomical findings have shown several circuits through the basal ganglia additional to the motor circuit. The caudate nucleus receives inputs from the prefrontal and limbic cortex. These inputs are transmitted to the globus pallidus, then to the thalamus and ultimately return to the dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate areas. Lesions in any part of these cortico-subcortical loops may be responsible for a dramatic behavioral syndrome, emphasizing their functional specificity in drive.

However, there is no current consensus on the treatment of post-stroke apathy, which mainly depends on the underlying etiology and comorbidities. A 62-year-old man, affected by hemorrhagic stroke in the left thalamus, presented with mood depression, anhedonia, hyporexia and marked apathy. The patient underwent clinical evaluation before and after receiving two different pharmacological therapies: escitalopram and bupropion. Only after treatment with the latter drug did the patient show changes: high motivation and willingness to pursue activities, greater interest in the external environment and social life activities, and an overall reduction of apathy. On the basis of our observations in this case, we hypothesize that the thalamic lesion resulted in disconnection of the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits, and that loss of the dopaminergic striatal innervation caused the patient's apathetic state. The resolution of the apathetic disorder may be attributable to the action of the dopaminergic drug bupropion on the mesocortical pathway.",{},,Functional neurology,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

At admission, she exhibited cognitive and visual deficits that were relatively mild but prevented a safe return to independent living. Two days later, she developed the sudden onset and rapid worsening of parkinsonian symptoms and excruciating bilateral lower-extremity pain. The pain was intractable, and over the next 2 days she progressed to being unable to walk or perform her activities of daily living without maximum assistance. A diagnosis of delayed postanoxic encephalopathy was made, and the patient responded to a trial of carbidopa and levodopa as well as redirection of her physical and occupational therapy programs.

We describe the first known report of an adolescent with a ventricular assist device who developed abulia following a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke who responded successfully to treatment with olanzapine. The neurobiological etiology of abulia is still unclear but is postulated to be related to deficits in the dopaminergic reward circuitry in the frontal-subcortical-mesolimbic regions. There have been reports of poststroke patients with abulia being treated by modulating this dopamine circuitry and in some cases with short-term low-dose olanzapine. Further research is needed to develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology of abulia leading to more effective treatment algorithms including more specific diagnostic tools and effective pharmacological interventions.",{},,Clinical neuropharmacology,10.1097/WNF.0000000000000389,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The orbitofrontal cortex has been reported to be associated with manic states in bipolar disorder and with mania-inducing lesions. Head trauma commonly disrupts various cognitive functions, including attention and information processing. Traumatic brain injury patients have been shown to have greater posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus functional connectivity to the rest of the default mode network. We describe a case of secondary mania after head trauma 24 years ago with low blood flow in the orbitofrontal cortex, high blood flow in the posterior cingulate cortex, and impaired cognitive functioning, including impaired attention and lowered processing speed. We describe a 30-year-old Japanese man with secondary mania and a medical history of head trauma 24 years ago. After head trauma at 6 years of age, the patient first showed apathy as a sign of frontal lobe impairment. After recovering, he experienced no psychiatric problems during adolescence, although he did show disinhibited behavior. At the onset of mania, low blood flow in the OFC and high blood flow in the PCC were observed as well as impaired cognitive function, including inattention and lowered processing speed. Abnormal cerebral blood flow was less prominent and cognitive dysfunction was partially recovered following recovery from mania, but his processing speed remained low. Although functional recovery from head trauma in childhood is better than that in adulthood, the brain may remain vulnerable for a long time. The risk of psychotic symptoms such as mania should be considered, even if sufficient superficial brain functional recovery is shown.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Annals of general psychiatry,10.1186/s12991-020-00282-7,PMC7218518,"Brain injuries, traumatic; Manic state; Orbitofrontal cortex; Posterior cingulate cortex",Case Reports,England,eng

The present report describes a case of a Eurasian lynx showing central nervous signs, including apathy and ataxia. A CT scan revealed multiple hypodense areas in different localizations within the brain as well as enlarged liquid filled areas, leading to the suspicion of a degenerative process. Due to clinical deterioration, the animal was euthanized and submitted for macroscopical and histological investigations. Histological investigations revealed multifocal demyelinations in the cerebellum, brain stem and cervical spinal cord as well as a multifocal, perivascular, lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis. A CDV infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analyses.

Among the various presentation suggestive of panhypopituitarism, psychosis, and features of schizophrenia is very rarely seen. In the majority of cases, neurosurgical intervention for the excision of tumor is considered a standard treatment modality but conservative management with dopamine agonist and steroids have also been shown to provide an optimal level of care also improving the quality of level of patient. A 42-year-old Asian male presented with a history of talking to self, delusion of persecution, over talkativeness, hallucination, increased suspiciousness, and history of lost and found in the streets where he was working as a migrant worker. The patient was initially managed in line of schizophrenia with the antipsychotics drug of choice. On further assessment there was no improvement of psychiatric symptoms but they further deteriorated with additional neuropsychiatric symptoms; hence, MRI brain was carried out. Following which, the diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma was confirmed and further more hormonal analysis was done, which showed findings suggestive of panhypopituitarism. The patient was then managed conservatively with dopamine agonist and steroids, which showed rapid improvement of psychiatric symptoms with a massive reduction in the size of the pituitary macroadenoma. With the incidence of 100 per million cases pituitary adenomas are considered locally invading with the characteristic compression of the surrounding structure, presenting as visual hallucinations, olfactory hallucinations, episodes of losing time, apathy, and features suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and symptoms secondary to hormonal imbalance such as hypothyroidism. Psychiatric symptomatic presentations are considered a very rare presentation in cases of pituitary macroadenoma. Also, psychiatric features and symptoms of psychosis are associated with prolcatinomas through idiopathic mechanism and the basic casualty has not been established. Surgical intervention such as trans-sphenoidal resection of the mass can be undertaken in case where mass effects is present but long-term remission and prognosis is found not to be fruitful. Conservative treatment with dopamine agonist such as cabergoline and steroids also plays a meaningful role in abrupt management in such cases. Pituitary macroadenoma presenting as a patient of schizophrenia is noted very rarely in medical literature; hence, investigations in view of neurosurgical diagnosis in cases presenting as psychosis should be considered for ideal holistic management.

High resolution MRI was performed to show the extent of the lesion; a combination of published and experimental neuropsychological techniques was administered to show the nature of the cognitive defects; Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was employed to obtain a measure of cortical perfusion. Brain MRI disclosed an isolated lacunar infarction in the dorsal caudal intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. Neuropsychological evaluation indicated problems with attention and concentration, executive disturbances, and memory deficits both in the visual and verbal domains. The memory deficits could not be attributed to problems in the early stages of information processing, and are hence regarded as resulting from a failure of retrieval rather than encoding or storage. Brain SPECT disclosed a hypoperfusion of the right frontal cortex. The data indicate that the cognitive profile is the result of a dysfunction of executive functions. This is corroborated by the finding of decreased blood flow in the right frontal cortex, and by evidence from the neuroanatomical literature.

Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid was normal. The serum analyses showed increased antithyroid (antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin) antibodies. In the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, supratentorial deep and peripheral white matter lesions were found; the electroencephalography showed intermittent slowing, and the [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) depicted medial and superior dorsolateral frontal hypometabolism. Several different psychopharmacological therapeutic approaches with various neuroleptics, antidepressants, and high doses of lorazepam were unsuccessful. Due to the organic alterations, including increased antithyroid antibodies, HE was suspected. Against expectations, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids proved to be ineffective and was associated with worsening symptoms. However, escalated treatment with plasmapheresis over 5 days led to significant improvement in all reported symptoms and in psychometric testing. The neuropsychological improvement was stable over a 6-month follow-up period, and the FDG-PET normalized. This case report reveals that (1) HE can mimic rapid onset dementia with predominantly frontal dysfunction; (2) this syndrome can be successfully treated in the context of HE; and (3) plasmapheresis can be effective in such a disease constellation. The detection of the immunological causes of rapid onset dementia and other psychiatric syndromes is important because it opens opportunities for new, innovative immunosuppressive treatment options.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00212,PMC5662557,Hashimoto’s encephalopathy; SREAT; frontotemporal dementia; plasmapheresis; thyroid,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

On admission, she was confused, dysarthric, and with meningeal signs. Brain angio-CT showed SAH FISHER IV and an aneurysm of the left posterior cerebral artery. After excluding the aneurysm (by coiling), the patient recovered the altered consciousness. Continuous EEG monitoring was initiated. On the sixth day of follow up, she had a transient headache and apathy. The brain MRI showed low cerebral blood flow in the left frontotemporal area, without ischemic lesions. On the seventh day, she presented expression aphasia and right facial-brachial paresis. Angiography confirmed severe vasospasm in M1 and M2 segments bilaterally. Pharmacological angioplasty with nimodipine was performed, with an excellent radiological response, although not clinical. A second MRI was carried out on the eighth day, which showed a left insular infarction and generalized vasospasm. A second therapeutic angiography was performed; the patient persisted with aphasia and left central facial paresis.

Agents included amantadine, amphetamine, bromocriptine, bupropion, methylphenidate, and selegiline. These histories support the suggestion that apathy is a discriminable dimension of behavior having its own pathophysiology and implications for psychiatric care.

Changes in artistic ability may accompany neurodegenerative disorders when they occur in an artist. The nature of these changes in the context of definable regional neuropathological disturbances may provide insight into the structural basis of the creative process. We describe a professional artist in whom presumed corticobasal degeneration (CBD) was associated with an alteration of his artistic judgement and production. Disinhibition, perseveration, and left hemispatial neglect, features of his cognitive profile were readily discernible in his work. The differences in his style are examined with respect to his main neuroanatomic abnormalities, namely right cerebral hemiatrophy as defined by magnetic resonance and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging. Cognitive deficits, including visuoconstructive and motor neglect, apathy, perseveration, and disinhibition as determined by neuropsychological testing, contributed to the dissolution of his artistic skills.

After observing partial benefit in one case, each patient admitted to rehabilitation following brain anoxia was systematically treated with levodopa/benserazide (200/50 to 400/100 mg/day), then bromocriptine (15 mg/day). In the first patient, brain anoxia was severe, with secondary agitation, quadriparesis, involuntary movements, inattention and communication disorders. Introduction of levodopa/benserazide resulted in reduction of agitation and involuntary movements and improvement of communication, thus facilitating care and rehabilitation efforts. A weaning test resulted in rapid worsening. The four following patients also presented with anoxia of variable severity. Marked improvement was observed in case 2, presenting with agitation, loss of orientation, amnesia, postural disorders, involuntary movements and dysphagia, with a withdrawal test resulting in immediate re-enhancement of symptoms. Modest improvement was observed in patient 3, who had hypokinesia, rigidity, adynamia, impaired attention, and reduced verbal fluency. Patient 4 presented with memory disorders without motor difficulties: mild improvement was observed in daily life and memory tests. In patient 5 who also presented with severe memory disorders, the benefit was absent. In each case, bromocriptine was introduced 3-4 weeks following levodopa, but without additive effect. Both treatments could be interrupted after a few months, without worsening. Levodopa and benserazide can be of benefit in the few months following brain anoxia, especially on some of the motor disorders and apathy, but the benefit is inconstant and modest on memory disorders.

23312758,Preservation of olfaction in surgery of olfactory groove meningiomas.,"Jang, Woo-Youl; Jung, Shin; Jung, Tae-Young; Moon, Kyung-Sub; Kim, In-Young",Jang,"Olfaction is commonly considered as secondary among the sensory functions, perhaps reflecting a lack of interest in sparing olfaction after surgery for the olfactory groove meningiomas (OGM). However, considering the repercussions of olfaction for the quality of life, the assessment of post-operative olfaction should be necessary. We retrospectively reviewed the olfactory outcome in patients with OGM and investigated the factors associated with sparing the post-operative olfaction. Between 1993 and 2012, 40 patients with OGM underwent surgical resection and estimated the olfactory function using the Korean version of ""Sniffin'Sticks"" test (KVSS). Variable factors, such as tumor size, degree of preoperative edema, tumor consistency, preoperative olfactory function, surgical approaches, patient's age, and gender were analyzed with attention to the post-operative olfactory function. Anatomical and functional preservation of olfactory structures were achieved in 26 patients (65%) and 22 patients (55%), respectively. Among the variable factors, size of tumor was significant related to the preservation of post-operative olfaction. (78.6% in size<4 cm and 42.3% in size>4 cm, p=0.035). Sparing the olfaction was significantly better in patients without preoperative olfactory dysfunction (84.6%) compared with ones with preoperative olfactory dysfunction (40.7%, p=0.016). The frontolateral approach achieved much more excellent post-operative olfactory function (71.4%) than the bifrontal approach (36.8%, p=0.032). If the tumor was smaller than 4 cm and the patients did not present olfactory dysfunction preoperatively, the possibility of sparing the post-operative olfaction was high. Among the variable surgical approaches, frontolateral route may be preferable sparing the post-operative olfaction.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.12.004,,Olfaction; Olfactory groove meningiomas; Surgical approach,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

In this case report, two male patients (patient A and patient B) with lesions involving the ACC bilaterally were assessed for apathy, depressive symptoms, executive functioning, and also tested on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Twenty neurologically intact controls also provided normative scores on the IGT. Patient A and patient B had high scores for apathy and low depressive symptoms scores. Patient A had relatively intact performance on standard executive function tests, but patient B had significant impairments. Both patients were significantly impaired on the IGT. Our findings suggest that executive function deficits are not crucial for the presence of apathy symptoms. These findings not only shed light on the relationship between apathy and executive function deficits, but also have important implications for patient care and rehabilitation.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-02-2012-5934,PMC4543105,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report on a case of pathological generosity secondary to a left lenticulocapsular stroke with hypoperfusion of several anatomically intact cortical areas. A 49-year-old man developed excessive and persistent generosity as he recovered from a left lenticulocapsular hematoma. His symptoms resembled an impulse control disorder. (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion mostly in the ipsilateral striatum, dorsolateral, and orbitofrontal cortex. This case study adds pathological generosity to the range of behavioral changes that may result from discrete unilateral lesions of the lenticular nucleus and nearby pathways. In our particular case, post-stroke pathological generosity was not ascribable to disinhibition, apathy, mania, or depression. Because pathological generosity may lead to significant distress and financial burden upon patients and their families, it may warrant further consideration as a potential type of impulse control disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.826681,,Basal ganglia; Frontal lobe syndrome; Generosity; Impulse control disorder; Stroke,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

16532698,[A case of left dorsomedial thalamic infarction with unilateral schizophrenia-like auditory hallucinations].,"Yoshida, Yukihiro; Abe, Koji; Yoshizawa, Kikuko",Yoshida,"We report a case of a right-handed, 73-year-old woman with auditory hallucinations lateralized to the right ear. A brain MRI revealed a small infarction in the left dorsomedial nucleus (DM) of the thalamus. The patient did not have either psychiatric or neurological prior history, and had otherwise been treated for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. Two months prior to admission, she had become forgetful, and had lost her wallet several times. She concurrently began to experience auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of her acquaintances, or ""the gods"". She frequently monologized and wandered about outside following the contents of the hallucinations. Therefore, she was admitted to our institution. On admission, no apparent abnormalities were revealed by physical examinations or blood analyses. She was alert and had no aphasic symptoms. Except for memory disturbances, no neurological symptoms, including no hearing loss, were found. A brain MRI showed a small localized infarction in the left DM, but EEG findings were normal. The patient had prominent anterograde memory deficits: she hardly remembered what she had done the very same day, or the names of the doctor and hospital. She also demonstrated a retrograde amnesia of the past decade or two: she showed difficulty recalling either personal history or social events that occurred during this era. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) revealed a total IQ of 75 (verbal IQ 77; performance IQ 77). The verbal hallucinations continued with frequent occurrence even after admission. They included voices telling her about misfortunes, such as death or sickness, of her relatives. These turned into threats and commands, such as ""I'm gonna kill ya. I attack you from behind. You, do not eat!"" In addition, she occasionally experienced ""third person auditory hallucination"", in which several men were discussing the plan to kill her. As is characteristic of this type of case, the hallucinations always appeared in only her right ear. They did not occur in the other modalities (e.g. as a visual one). She was convinced that the hallucinations were real and looked frightened while they were happening. Whereas the anterograde amnesia continued for 6 months after admission, the retrograde amnesia gradually improved within 2 or 3 months after admission, although a partial amnesia on the past decade eventually turned out to persistent. On the other hand, the hallucinations did not ameliorate satisfactorily with risperidone (3-6 mg/day), but on augmentation with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day), they lessened gradually and almost disappeared within 6 months. She also slowly developed symptoms similar to those of frontal lobe syndrome, i.e., aspontaneity and apathy. In conclusion, our case indicates the importance of DM on memory function. It is noteworthy that schizophrenia-like hallucinations developed in the case. Localized neuronal deficits evoked by infarction in the left DM probably caused the schizophrenia-like hallucinations; the lateralization phenomenon further indicates the involvement of specific neuronal mechanisms in the mediation of the hallucinations. According to the knowledge of the functional anatomy of the DM and the lateralization phenomenon of auditory hallucinations, it is possible that the neuronal loop, comprised of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, designated as ""basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits"", in addition to the left temporal cortex, plays an important role in the development of the hallucinations in this case. This possibility might also shed light on the neurological basis of schizophrenia.",{},,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Here we presented the first reported case to our knowledge in Mexican population and the unusual presentation in a pregnant patient.

After treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins a marked and prompt clinical and radiological improvement was observed. SuS is still an elusive disease.

Twenty-six patients who had undergone bilateral thermocapsulotomy were followed up 1 year after the procedure and after a mean of 13 years. Primary diagnoses were generalized anxiety disorder (N=13), panic disorder (N=8), and social phobia (N=5). Measures of psychiatric status included symptom rating scales and neuropsychological testing. Ratings were done by psychiatrists not involved in patient selection or postoperative treatment. A quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was conducted to search for common anatomic denominators. Seventeen of the 23 patients who were alive at long-term follow-up were followed up in person, and one was interviewed by telephone; the relatives of these 18 patients were interviewed. The reduction in anxiety ratings was significant both at 1-year and long-term follow-up. Seven patients, however, were rated as having substantial adverse symptoms; the most prominent adverse symptoms were apathy and dysexecutive behavior. Neuropsychological performance was significantly worse in the patients with adverse symptoms. No common anatomic denominator could be found in responders in the analysis of MRI scans. Thermocapsulotomy is an effective treatment for selected cases of nonobsessive anxiety but may carry a significant risk of adverse symptoms indicating impairment of frontal lobe functioning. These findings underscore the importance of face-to-face assessments of adverse symptoms.",{},,The American journal of psychiatry,10.1176/appi.ajp.160.3.513,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

This is the first report of the association of an apathy and abnormal gambling behaviour following a stroke affecting sub-cortical structures. Although the location of the lesions, affecting the dorsal striatum, may explain the emergence of an apathetic state, it is, however, at first sight, not easy to explain the gambling behaviour because the patient was normal in tests evaluating sensitivity to reward, and no radiological abnormality was found in the cortical-sub-cortical system of reward. It is proposed that, for this patient, the mechanism of maladaptive gambling behaviour was the development of a routine behaviour related to the patient's cognitive inertia, a mechanism different from the changes in reward sensitivity observed after damage to the orbital ventral prefrontal-ventral striatum system or in dopamine dysregulation syndrome in Parkinson's disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-010-5579-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The symptoms consisted of indifference, docility and inappropriate urination, but predominantly in a lack of attention. She was unable to maintain the attention necessary to perform a goal-directed activity and she was distracted by any stimulus, such as a sound, an object, or a word, which might induce behaviour irrelevant to the preconceived activity. She also exhibited confabulatory-amnestic syndrome. Neuropathological examination of the brain revealed infarcts in th territories of both anterior cerebral arteries. The rostral part of the anterior cingulate gyrus (Acg), small areas of the adjacent medial prefrontal cortex, and the underlying white matter were destroyed bilaterally. Infarction involved the deep territory of the left anterior cerebral artery, with a bilateral lesion of the fornices. This cingulate damage was more restricted than the Acg lesions reported in some cases of akinetic-mutism, which extended more caudally, but was presumably larger than the lesions created in psychosurgery.

After their surgical resection, recurrence usually occurs in the region of the original tumor bed. Ectopic recurrence of craniopharyngiomas is extremely rare. It usually occurs either along the surgical route, because of direct surgical seeding, or at a distal location in the subarachnoid space, because of seeding along the cerebrospinal fluid pathways. We present 3 examples of ectopic recurrences of craniopharyngiomas. The first patient was a 52-year-old woman with a history of resected suprasellar craniopharyngioma presenting 15 years later with a history of balance problems and new onset of double vision. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a tumor in the prepontine cistern. The second patient was a 41-year-old man with a history of a resected suprasellar craniopharyngioma presenting 9 years later with headache, dizziness, and disequilibrium. He was noted by his family to have an altered behavior with progressively increasing indifference. His magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a right frontal lesion in the vicinity of the sylvian fissure. The third patient was a 24-year-old man with a history of suprasellar craniopharyngioma resection, followed by conventional radiotherapy 12 years before his recent presentation with headache, numbness of the right side of his face, and increased drowsiness. His magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a bilateral cystic cerebellopontine angle lesion. The first patient underwent operation via a petrosal approach with subtotal resection of the tumor and decompression of the brainstem; this patient had an uneventful postoperative course. The tumor in the second patient was surgically resected through a pterional craniotomy, with an uneventful postoperative course. The third patient's right-sided cerebellopontine angle lesion was microsurgically resected, and the patient was given a single-dose gamma knife for the left-side and residual small right-side tumor. The histological diagnosis of all 3 lesions was craniopharyngioma. Although ectopic recurrence of a craniopharyngioma is very rare, it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of what appears to be a new tumor in a patient with a history of previously resected craniopharyngiomas.

Thus, there is a need to reappraise the broad spectrum of SLDs in PSP to include other presenting phenotypes. Here we report findings from the study of two elderly patients with PSP presenting with DA and irrepressible echolalia. Both patients had markedly impoverished verbal production, but their performance in other tasks (repetition and naming) and auditory comprehension were preserved or only mildly impaired. Experimental tests of DA revealed impaired word and sentence generation in response to verbal and non-verbal stimuli. Additional language and cognitive testing revealed different types of echolalia (mitigated, automatic, and echoing approval) as well as impaired inhibitory control and social cognition (mentalizing). Both patients had negative neuropsychiatric alterations (i.e., apathy, aspontaneity, and indifference/emotional flatness). Brain magnetic resonance imaging in both patients showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum and superior medial frontal cortex suggestive of PSP, yet further evaluation of the neural correlates using multimodal neuroimaging and neuropathological data was not performed. However, based on the already known neural basis of DA and echolalia in PSP and stroke, we suggest that, in the present cases, neurodegeneration in the midbrain tegmentum, superior medial frontal lobe, and caudate nucleus was responsible for DA and that decreased activity in these regions may play a permissive role for eliciting verbal echoing <i>via</i> disinhibition of the perisylvian speech-language network.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,10.3389/fnagi.2021.635896,PMC8129544,dynamic aphasia; echolalia; inhibition deficits; primary progressive aphasia; progressive supranuclear palsy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We explored this process to improve care and quality of life for brain cancer patients in an academic neuro-oncology program. Brain cancer and its treatments may threaten a patient's quality of life and sense of self in many ways, including impaired cognitive skills, loss of memory, reduced coordination, and limited capacity for self-expression. The impact of symptoms and side effects on quality of life must be evaluated in terms of each patient's identity and may be understood in terms of each patient's story. Insights from Narrative Medicine visits may also be helpful for the treatment team as they seek to assess patient needs, attitudes, and abilities. We provide case-based histories demonstrating applications of Narrative Medicine in the care of patients with brain tumors whose sense of self and quality of life are challenged. The cases include managing frontal lobe syndrome of loss of initiative and pervasive emotional apathy with his wife and young children, regaining a meaningful activity in a patient, re-establishing self-identity in a young woman with ependymoma, and improving spells with coexistent epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neuro-oncology,10.1007/s11060-017-2542-5,,Brain tumor; Glioblastoma; Narrative medicine; Quality of life; Self-identity,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Significant gross findings included several nodules randomly distributed throughout the pulmonary lobes of both horses, and the kidneys, myocardium, and the frontal lobes of the cerebrum of the filly. Histopathological evaluation revealed pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia in both horses; granulomatous interstitial nephritis, myocarditis, and encephalitis were observed in the filly. All lesions contained vasculitis and thrombosis associated with myriads of intralesional, branching, septate fungi consistent with Aspergillus spp.; intralesional fungi were more easily identified by the Grocott methenamine silver stain. Mycological culture of fresh pulmonary sections from both horses and the brain of the filly revealed pure growths of A. fumigatus. These findings confirmed the participation of A. fumigatus in the etiopathogenesis of the lesions observed in the lungs of both horses, and the cerebrum, myocardium and kidneys of the filly and might represent the first description of A. fumigatus-induced encephalitis in horses.

We describe the case of a 77-year-old male with vascular risk factors who presented sudden onset mnemonic deficit that affected basic activities of daily living, and apathy. Examination of the patient revealed an anterograde episodic amnesia with an inability to retain new information and short-term memory was also clearly affected, although access to old memories remained relatively intact. There was no other sensory-motor focus. A CAT scan showed a right-side sylvian infarction and hypodense areas in both hippocampuses.

The patient was an 80-year-old right-handed woman who was admitted to a rehabilitation unit to receive postoperative rehabilitation after a femoral neck fracture. She was instructed quadriceps isometric exercises to perform 10 repetitions and to hold each stretch for 10 s. She performed the exercise correctly with motivation, but she had difficulty in learning the number of repetitions and the duration of each stretch. She had no history of cerebrovascular accident and the neurological examination was normal. Neuropsychological testing, MRI and (18)F-fluoro- D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were performed to examine the neural mechanisms associated with this difficulty in learning instructions. Neuropsychological tests revealed dysfunction of working memory while other cognitive domains were relatively preserved. Her neuropsychological tests scores were (1) Mini-Mental State Examination: 24 (mild cognitive impairment), (2) Geriatric Depression Scale-15: 2 (no depression), (3) Apathy Scale: 2 (no apathy), (4) digit span forward: 5 (normal), (5) digit span backward: 2 (impaired), (6) visuospatial span forward: 4 (normal), (7) visuospatial span backward: 2 (impaired), (8) frontal assessment battery: 11 (normal), (9) Weigl test: 0 (impaired), (10) trail making test A: 52 s (normal), (11) train making test B: failed (impaired).

Traumatic brain injury is a frequent cause. Drugs activating the dopaminergic system provide variable benefit. A 30-year-old patient was the victim of a severe head injury with frontal bruise at the age of 15. At the request of his family, he consulted for a 7-year history that included a lack of initiative and the inability to generate behavior spontaneously, contrasting with the ability to execute behaviors on command. He also presented indifference, major emotional disruption without sadness, pessimism, and other depressive signs. The examination found a severe apathetic syndrome confirmed by specific scales with a mild impairment of executive functions and without depressive syndrome. Encephalic MRI showed atrophy of the whole prefrontal cerebral cortex. The patient was treated with bromocriptine, which he did not tolerate, then with Selegiline at 15 mg per day, which dramatically improved his symptoms. Apathy occurs frequently after traumatic brain injury, in 23-71% of patients according to the authors. The pathophysiology of apathy has been described in anatomical terms as related to disruption of frontal-subcortical pathways. The biochemical hypothesis postulates a disruption in dopaminergic activity. The use of dopaminergic agents usually improves cases similar to our patient. Apathy is frequent following head injury, warranting a search for systematic causes.

The diagnosis can be made either at autopsy or premortem by combining biopsy and neuroimaging findings to demonstrate involvement of more than two lobes of the brain. Extensive hemispheric white matter and corpus callosum infiltration is characteristic, with lesser spread to subcortical and cortical gray matter. Whereas this pattern of localization can be predicted to cause significant disturbances of higher function, the neurobehavioral profile of gliomatosis cerebri patients has not been well described. Three patients with gliomatosis cerebri had detailed neurobehavioral assessment, and one had neuropsychological testing early in the disease. Neuropathological investigation focused on the localization of the neoplasm, the correlation between extent of myelin and axon damage with tumor cell density, and the histogenesis of the tumor. The patient with neuropsychological testing had impaired executive function and verbal memory retrieval that reflected bifrontal and left temporal white matter tumor involvement seen on neuroimaging. In the other cases, apathy and fatigue progressed to severe dementia in association with bihemispheric white matter infiltration. Myelin and axon stains and myelin stains showed relative preservation of white matter architecture with severity of damage paralleling increased tumor cell density. Immunostaining for TP53 was found in a high percentage of tumor nuclei in two of three cases, suggesting overlapping features between gliomatosis cerebri and diffuse astrocytomas. Subtle cognitive and emotional alterations antedate the florid dementia that develops later in the course of gliomatosis cerebri. Clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data suggest that white matter is damaged directly by the tumor and its associated mild edema, although infiltration of subcortical and cortical gray matter also occurs to a variable extent. Strong TP53 immunostaining in gliomatosis cerebri suggests a commonality with diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas that also often show TP53 staining. Gliomatosis cerebri can be considered a cause of white matter dementia resulting from preferential neoplastic disruption of white matter tracts.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/00146965-200309000-00002,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although patients with some types of somatic disorders frequently present with psychiatric symptoms, there are often indications (e.g. from history or physical examination) that in fact the symptoms are of organic origin.

The exact functional-anatomic mechanism underlying loss of psychic self-activation following bithalamic lesions remains to be elucidated. We present clinical, neuropsychological, structural, and functional neuroimaging data of an 18-month follow-up period of a man with prominent loss of psychic self-activation after coronary arteriography. Except for memory decline, accompanying symptoms remained restricted to the acute phase. The neurobehavioral syndrome consisted mainly of apathy, indifference, poor motivation, and flattened affect, and this remained unchanged during the entire follow-up period. MRI showed a bithalamic infarction involving the nucleus medialis thalami bilaterally. Single-photon emission CT revealed a severe relative hypoperfusion of both thalami, a relative hypoperfusion of both nuclei caudati, and a relative hypoperfusion mesiofrontally. Single-photon emission CT data support the hypothesis that the neurobehavioral manifestations after bithalamic paramedian infarction are caused by disruption of the striatal-ventral pallidal-thalamic-frontomesial limbic loop. Probably, bilateral disruption at different levels of the striatal-ventral pallidal-thalamic-frontomesial loop may lead to a similar clinical picture consisting of loss of psychic self-activation.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.31.7.1762,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The acute syndrome featured fluctuating alertness, inattention, memory loss, apathy, abulia, and psychomotor retardation, suggesting frontal lobe dysfunction. Contralateral hemiparesis and dysarthria were generally mild, except when the infarct extended into the posterior limb. Neuropsychological testing in five patients with left-sided infarcts revealed severe verbal memory loss. Additional cognitive deficits consistent with dementia occurred in four patients. A right-sided infarct caused transient impairment in visuospatial memory. Functional brain imaging in three patients showed a focal reduction in hemispheric perfusion most prominent in the ipsilateral inferior and medial frontal cortex. We infer that the capsular genu infarct interrupted the inferior and anterior thalamic peduncles, resulting in functional deactivation of the ipsilateral frontal cortex.

With reference to the functional circuits linking the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia, as described by Alexander, this syndrome of combined disinhibition of motricity, speech and affect could involve either the lateral orbito-frontal or the anterior cingulate loops, more especially the indirect pathways travelling through the subthalamic nucleus, lesion of which is known to disinhibit thalamo-cortical activity.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre
17315758,[Depression following intracerebral hemorrhage and the evaluation of cerebral blood flow by single photon emission tomography].,"Masada, Tetsuya; Makabe, Tetsuo; Kunishio, Katsuzo; Matsumoto, Akira",Masada,"The authors studied patients who presented depression and apathy following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Twelve patients who were admitted in our hospital were divided into two groups according to the presence of post-stroke depression (PSD). Five patients with PSD are in group A, and another seven patients without PSD are in group B. Zung-self depression scale (SDS) and apathy scale were used for screening of depression and apathy. PSD was recognized in 5 (42%) of patients following ICH. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) suggested the reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the frontal lobe in all patients of the group A (100%), whereas only 29% of patients of the group B. The reduction of CBF in the frontal lobe might be involved in the mechanism of depression following ICH in subacute stage.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

10548918,[A case of abulia without memory disturbance due to infarction of the bilateral genua of the internal capsules].,"Namekawa, M; Fujii, T; Nishizawa, M; Nakano, I",Namekawa,"A 68-year-old right handed man with treated hypertension presented with acute-onset somnolence without hemiparesis, dysarthria or sensory disturbance. Although he became laconic and his verbal responses were only in short terms, his replies were accurate and judgmental. A cranial MRI in axial, coronal, and sagittal section revealed small hemorrhagic infarcts essentially limited to the bilateral capsular genua without involvement of the inferior thalamic peduncles. A 123I-IMP single photon emission CT disclosed remarkable hypoperfusion in the bilateral frontal cortex. After a week of somnolence, he gradually became wakeful, but was still abulic. Neuropsychological examinations revealed no memory disturbance. We consider that disconnection of the thalamo-frontal projection at the genua of the internal capsules caused somnolence, apathy, and abulia in our case. The hitherto reported cases of the genu infarcts that showed memory disturbance had the lesion involving both the inferior thalamic peduncle and its nearby mamillothalamic tract. In contrast, our case without memory disturbance had infarcts confined to the genua apparently sparing the two tracts, implicating that memory function may be preserved when such structures are intact.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed atrophy in the frontal regions. This finding is significant because the patient has no known history of traumatic brain injury, inhalant or alcohol abuse, or prolonged exposure to gasoline. On the basis of the results of the brain imaging in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation and neuropsychological testing, frontotemporal dementia was considered in the diagnosis and was thought to explain his chronic symptoms of apathy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation.

Each subject received a comprehensive neuropsychological examination including a personality inventory. On the initial examination the results indicated that the patient had a significant depression of performance intellectual functioning, impairments of attention, non-verbal short-term memory and visual judgement of angles and directions, psychomotor retardation and personality changes including depression, anxiety, desire to be alone, lack of interest and sensitivity to physical problems. Such an impairment picture is compatible with the previous observations of individuals with chronic exposure to elemental, organic or inorganic mercury. The follow-up study was undertaken about 1.5 years later. The results show that the patient's cognitive and personality functions were fully recovered.

Following an initial stage of diffuse encephalopathy, the neurological sequelae are usually of diffuse cognitive deficits and extrapyramidal or cortico-bulbo-spinal disorders. We report a case of extrapontine myelinolisis following hypertonic peritoneal lavage due to rupture of a hydatid cyst of the liver (HCL), which was followed by a syndrome of isolated amnesia due to bilateral hippocampal lesions. Following rupture of a HCL a 37 year old man was treated by peritoneal lavage with hypertonic saline solution. In the immediate postoperative period he had a prolonged confusion state associated with natremia of 176 mg/dl, which was corrected in less than 24 hours. Seven days later the patient had an apathy-inattention frontal syndrome. Six weeks later, and lasting until three months after operation, he had a selective memory deficit in learning tests (of the Barcelona-PIENC series of tests) with normality (29/30) in the MMST. On magnetic resonance there were hyperintense images in T2 in both hippocampus, insulas and corpus callosum. Generally caused by rapidly corrected hyponatremia, isolated hyponatremia or hypernatremia may also lead to extrapontine myelinolisis. However, we have found no report of extrapontine myelinolisis due to rupture of HCL and treatment with hypertonic peritoneal lavage. The neurological sequelae of extrapontine myelinolisis are usually global cognitive deficits, extra-pyramidal or cortico-bulbo-spinal disorders. Lesions seen on MR are usually found in the basal ganglia, thalamus or corpus callosum (with or without involvement of the pons). We have found no descriptions of bilateral hippocampal lesions causing selective memory deficits in this condition. Treatment by hypertonic peritoneal lavage for ruptured HCL may cause severe hydro-electrolytic alterations which may lead to myelinolisis of the CNS. We report of a case with bilateral hippocampal lesions and selective memory deficit, not previously described within the clinical spectrum of extrapontine myelinolisis.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

The patient developed weakness in the four limbs, with hypotonicity, absence of tendon reflexes and showed bilateral Babinski signs. A T2 weighted sagittal cranial-magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high signal within mid-pons suggesting central pontine myelinolysis. In this case we highlight the absence of hyponatremia.

In addition, early mental status changes often occur as a result of virusencephalitis, beside focal neurological deficiencies, epileptic seizures, cerebral compression, even coma. Other pathological manifestations of virusencephalitis are disturbances of the neurohumoral and the endocrine system, which are often recognised and treated too late. This case report describes symptoms, treatment, and complications of a 76 year old female in-patient, who was diagnosed with virusencephalitis. The number of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid was increased to 30 cells per microliter, liquor albumin was 1705 mg/l, liquor sugar was 53 mg/dl and liquor lactat was 1.9 mmol/l. IgM antibodies against herpes viruses were found in the cerebrospinal fluid and distinct contrasting foci were found near the mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, tractus opticus, hypophyseal stalk and right parahippocampal in the magnetic resonance imaging of the head, indicating a focal herpes simplex encephalitis. Within seven days, the following symptoms developed: akinetic parkinsonian syndrome, central diabetes insipidus with hypernatremia and polyuria (6 l/die), hypothyreosis, adrenal insufficiency with adynamia, sopor, hypotension and even hypophyseal coma. Panhypopituitarism was diagnosed after measuring the basal hormone levels (ACTH, TSH, FT3, FT4, Cortisol, Prolactin, LH, FSH, ADH) and conducting the pituitary stimulation test. The severeness of all symptoms was slightly improved after substitution with antidiuretic hormone at 0.4 microgram/die and administration of hydrocortisone at 50 mg/die. Administration of amantadine sulphate at 0.6 g/die and L-dopa at 187.5 mg/die for 14 days resulted in a complete regression of the parkinsonism. After administration of aciclovir at 2.25 g/die for 21 days a complete regression of the clinical symptoms could be reached in connection with a decrease of 90% in number and size of cerebral contrasting foci in the magnetic resonance imaging of the head. Three month after therapy, clinical examination and blood serum analysis revealed persistent panhypopituitarism. The present case report is the first description of a viral infection on of the central nervous system (CNS) in combination with parkinsonism, diabetes insipidus, persistent panhypopituitarism and hyperprolactinemia. Early treatment of viral infections of the brain can improve a patient's prognosis dramatically. Early determination and early treatment of a patient's neurohumoral parameters is therefore critical to prevent or reverse early mental status changes like attention disturbances, alterations of personality and behavior, apathy, and slowed cognition.",{},,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,10.1055/s-2007-994998,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,ger
