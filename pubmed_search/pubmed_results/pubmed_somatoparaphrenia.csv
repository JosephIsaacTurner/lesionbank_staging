28513323,Modulation of somatoparaphrenia following left-hemisphere damage.,"D'Imperio, Daniela; Tomelleri, Giampaolo; Moretto, Giuseppe; Moro, Valentina",D'Imperio,"Somatoparaphrenic symptoms after left-hemisphere damage are rare. To verify the potential role of body-related sensory (proprioceptive, visual, and somatosensory) manipulation in patients experiencing sensations of hand disownership, the symptoms of a patient suffering from right-hand somatoparaphrenia were monitored and clinical and neuropsychological variables were controlled. Four types of manipulation were administered: changes in spatial position of the hand, multisensory stimulation, and self-observation using video or mirrors. Multisensory visuo-tactile stimulation was efficacious in terms of reducing somatoparaphrenia, and changes in the position of the hand produced some positive effects. Third-person perspective self-observation did not, however, result in any changes.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2017.1329444,,Disturbed sensation of limb ownership; Gertmann’s syndrome; body awareness; rehabilitation; somatoparaphrenia after a left-hemisphere lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There is some controversy concerning lesion site (fronto-parietal; parieto-temporal; posterior insula, additional subcortical nuclei) or necessary associated symptoms (hemiparesis/plegia, anosognosia, neglect, position sense deficit). We here present a patient who is unusual in many respects, that is: (1) he is a right-hander with somatoparaphrenia after a ""dominant"" left-hemisphere lesion associated with aphasia and ideo-motor apraxia, but also with right hemineglect. He thus has ""crossed"" somatoparaphrenia; (2) his delusional misidentification concerned the right leg and not the arm or hand; (3) he has no anosognosia; (4) his proprioception is disturbed for the leg only; and (5) the lesion site is very posterior, a left occipito-parietal haemorrhage without involvement of the frontal lobe or the posterior insula. We present this case together with the seven other cases of ""crossed somatoparaphrenia"" with and without aphasia we found since 1935 in the literature and discuss their relevance in relation to the above controversies.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-014-4101-z,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",Germany,eng

Somatoparaphrenia (SP), a delusional belief concerning the experienced disownership for the contralesional paralyzed arm, represents the disruption of such mechanism. In two experiments, we have investigated the alteration of limb disownership after spatial manipulations in a right-brain-damaged patient affected by chronic SP. In experiment 1 the patient's spatial attention was switched between the left and right sides of space. SP signs worsened when the patient was interviewed from the left compared to the right bedside. In the second experiment we showed the first systematic transient remission of SP using left caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS), a physiologic manipulation mainly acting on the spatial frame of reference. Taken together, these results shed further light on the spatial nuance of SP and on the importance of vestibular signals for the generation of a coherent body representation. Furthermore, our case study demonstrated the possibility of eliciting more severe SP signs if the patient is interviewed from the left bedside. Additionally, CVS applications may have an important impact on the rehabilitation of these symptoms.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2015.1077257,,Somatoparaphrenia; caloric vestibular stimulation; right brain damage; space,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35696732,Reach planning with someone else's hand.,"Rossi Sebastiano, Alice; Poles, Karol; Miller, Luke E; Fossataro, Carlotta; Milano, Edoardo; Gindri, Patrizia; Garbarini, Francesca",Rossi Sebastiano,"To investigate the relationship between the sense of body ownership and motor control, we capitalized on a rare bizarre disorder wherein another person's hand is misattributed to their own body, i.e., a pathological form of embodiment (E+). Importantly, despite E+ is usually associated with motor deficits, we had the opportunity to test two E+ patients with spared motor function, thus able to perform a reaching task. Crucially, these patients had proprioceptive deafferentation, allowing us to purely isolate the embodiment-dependent effect from proprioception-dependent ones that are usually associated in experimental manipulations of body ownership in healthy participants. Previous evidence suggests that the reaching movement vector is attracted towards an embodied hand during the rubber hand illusion (RHI). However, these results are confounded by the spared proprioception, whose modulation alone could explain the effects on reach planning. The neuropsychological approach employed here provides unambiguous evidence about the role of body ownership in reach planning. Indeed, three brain-damaged patients with proprioceptive deafferentation, two E+ and a well-matched control patient without pathological embodiment (E-), and 10 age-matched healthy controls underwent a reaching task wherein they had to reach for a target from a fixed starting point, while an alien hand (the co-experimenter's) was placed on the table. Irrespective of proprioception, damaged in all patients, only in E+ patients reaching errors were significantly more shifted consistently with the pathological belief, i.e., as if they planned movements from the position of the alien (embodied) hand, as compared to controls. Furthermore, with an additional experiment on healthy participants, we demonstrated that reaching errors observed during the RHI correlate with the changes in ownership. In conclusion, our neuropsychological approach suggests that when planning a reach, we do so from where our owned hand is and not from its physical location.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2022.05.005,,Body ownership; Motor planning; Pathological embodiment; Proprioception,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
21969696,The role of self-touch in somatosensory and body representation disorders after stroke.,"van Stralen, H E; van Zandvoort, M J E; Dijkerman, H C",van Stralen,"Somatosensory impairments occur in about half of the cases of stroke. These impairments range from primary deficits in tactile detection and the perception of features, to higher order impairments in haptic object recognition and bodily experience. In this paper, we review the influence of active- and self-touch on somatosensory impairments after stroke. Studies have shown that self-touch improves tactile detection in patients with primary tactile deficits. A small number of studies concerned with the effect of self-touch on bodily experience in healthy individuals have demonstrated that self-touch influences the structural representation of one's own body. In order to better understand the effect of self-touch on body representations, we present an informal study of a stroke patient with somatoparaphrenia and misoplegia. The role of self-touch on body ownership was investigated by asking the patient to stroke the impaired left hand and foreign hands. The patient reported ownership and a change in affect over all presented hands through self-touch. The time it took to accomplish ownership varied, based on the resemblance of the foreign hand to the patient's own hand. Our findings suggest that self-touch can modulate impairments in body ownership and affect, perhaps by helping to reinstate the representation of the body.",{},,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

23603022,Body ownership and attention in the mirror: insights from somatoparaphrenia and the rubber hand illusion.,"Jenkinson, Paul M; Haggard, Patrick; Ferreira, Nicola C; Fotopoulou, Aikaterini",Jenkinson,"The brain receives and synthesises information about the body from different modalities, coordinates and perspectives, and affords us with a coherent and stable sense of body ownership. We studied this sense in a somatoparaphrenic patient and three control patients, all with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. We experimentally manipulated the visual perspective (direct- versus mirror-view) and spatial attention (drawn to peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space) in an experiment involving recognising one's own hand. The somatoparaphrenic patient denied limb ownership in all direct view trials, but viewing the hand via a mirror significantly increased ownership. The extent of this increase depended on spatial attention; when attention was drawn to the extrapersonal space (near-the-mirror) the patient showed a near perfect recognition of her arm in the mirror, while when attention was drawn to peripersonal space (near-the-body) the patient recognised her arm in only half the mirror trials. In a supplementary experiment, we used the Rubber Hand Illusion to manipulate the same factors in healthy controls. Ownership of the rubber hand occurred in both direct and mirror view, but shifting attention between peripersonal and extrapersonal space had no effect on rubber-hand ownership. We conclude that the isolation of visual perspectives on the body and the division of attention between two different locations is not sufficient to affect body ownership in healthy individuals and right hemisphere controls. However, in somatoparaphrenia, where first-person body ownership and stimulus-driven attention are impaired by lesions to a right-hemisphere ventral attentional-network, the body can nevertheless be recognised as one's own if perceived in a third-person visual perspective and particularly if top-down, spatial attention is directed away from peripersonal space.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.03.029,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
31194981,The dynamic nature of the sense of ownership after brain injury. Clues from asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.,"Romano, Daniele; Maravita, Angelo",Romano,"The sense of ownership is the feeling that a body part belongs to ourselves. Brain damage may disrupt this feeling, leading to somatoparaphrenia (SP), i.e., the delusion that one's limbs belong to someone else. This delusional feeling is typically associated with profound motor and somatosensory deficits. We reviewed the cases of SP reported so far in the literature outlining the clinical and neuroanatomical profile of SP. We then investigated and reported three new peculiar cases of SP that allow new insights into the theoretical framework of this neuropsychological condition. We thus propose an innovative theoretical account that integrates previous evidence and the new cases described. We suggest that a defective update of the ongoing dynamic representation of the body finalised to perception and action, may be the key for the disownership feelings of patients with SP. The erroneous spatial representation of the limb contralateral to the lesion would have the logical consequence of delusional misattribution of the seen own arm.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107119,,Body awareness; Body ownership; Body representation; Body schema; Right brain damage; Somatoparaphrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
34054464,Intentional Supernumerary Motor Phantom Limb after Right Cerebral Stroke: A Case Report.,"Yamada, Mai; Sasahara, Yoshimi; Seto, Makiko; Satoh, Akira; Tsujihata, Mitsuhiro",Yamada,"A 47-year-old right-handed man was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation after right basal ganglion hematoma. On day 57, he noticed a supernumerary motor phantom limb (SPL) involving his right arm, originating at the level of the elbow. The most notable finding of his SPL was the motor characteristic. When the subject had the intention to move the upper paralyzed limb simultaneously with the trainer's facilitating action, he said ""there is another arm."" The intention to move the paralyzed arm alone or passive movement of the paralyzed arm did not induce the SPL. He showed a severe left sensorimotor impairment and mild hemineglect, but no neglect syndromes of the body (e.g., asomatognosia, somatoparaphrenia, personification and misoplegia, or anosognosia) were observed. Brain MRI demonstrated a hematoma in the right temporal lobe subcortex, subfrontal cortex, putamen, internal capsule, and thalamus. Single-photon emission computed tomography images showed more widespread hypoperfusion in the right hemisphere in comparison to the lesions on MRI. However, the premotor cortex was preserved. Our case is different from Staub's case in that SPL was not induced by the intention to move the paralyzed limb alone; rather, it was induced when the patient intended to move the paralyzed limb with a trainer's simultaneous facilitating action. The SPL may reflect that an abnormal closed-loop function of the thalamocortical system underlies the phantom phenomenon. However, despite the severe motor and sensory impairment, the afferent pathway from the periphery to the premotor cortex may have been partially preserved, and this may have been related to the induction of SPL.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000513302,PMC8138257,Intentional motor phantom limb; Premotor cortex; Stroke; Supernumerary phantom limb,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

To date, there is limited evidence for the effective treatments of this disease. Here we used caloric vestibular stimulation to reduce pain and somatoparaphrenia in a 57-year-old woman suffering from central post-stroke pain. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the neurological effects of this treatment. Following vestibular stimulation we observed impressive improvements in motor skills, pain, and somatic delusions. In the functional connectivity study before the vestibular stimulation, we observed differences in the patient's left thalamus functional connectivity, with respect to the thalamus connectivity of a control group (N = 20), in the bilateral cingulate cortex and left insula. After the caloric stimulation, the left thalamus functional connectivity with these regions, which are known to be involved in the cortical response to pain, disappeared as in the control group. The beneficial use of vestibular stimulation in the reduction of pain and somatic delusion in a CPSP patient is now documented by behavioral and imaging data.

During KINVIS intervention, a computer screen displayed a pre-recorded mirror image video of the patient's unaffected hand performing flexion-extension movements as if it were attached to the patient's affected forearm. Kinematics during the flexion-extension movements of the paretic hand were recorded before and after 20-min interventions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the affected and non-affected hemispheres. The amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) at rest was recorded for the muscles of both hands. After the intervention, the total trajectory length and the rectangular area bounding the trajectory of the index fingertip decreased. The MEP amplitude of the paretic hand increased, whereas the MEP amplitude of the non-paretic hand was unchanged. The changes in kinematics after the intervention suggested that KINVIS therapy may be a useful new intervention for sensory ataxia, a condition for which few effective treatments are currently available. Studies in larger numbers of patients are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this therapeutic effect.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Progress in rehabilitation medicine,10.2490/prm.20200025,PMC7591318,body ownership; kinesthetic illusion; sensory ataxia; stroke; transcranial magnetic stimulation,Case Reports,Japan,eng
25360817,Peculiar body representation alterations in hemineglect: a case report.,"Di Vita, A; Palermo, L; Piccardi, L; Guariglia, C",Di Vita,"We report the case of FP affected by personal and extrapersonal neglect and a body representation deficit characterized by delusional ideas. When FP performed the human figure, he placed body parts to the left, despite his extrapersonal neglect. Differently, when he performed the car figure, he placed all parts to the right, in line with his deficit. Comparing FP with a small patient group with the same clinical features without delusional ideas about body emerged that he was the only one to suffer from a specific body representation deficit characterized by a lack of body ownership sense.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2014.974620,,anosognosia; body ownership; body representation; body schema; personal neglect,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Whereas extrapersonal neglect has been found associated with both right- and left-sided brain lesions, no case of right personal neglect following a left-sided lesion has been so far reported. We describe a right-handed female patient who, after two left-hemisphere strokes, exhibited a florid personal neglect, but no extrapersonal neglect, anosognosia or somatoparaphrenia. The symptom persisted for a few weeks and then gradually disappeared. At least in the early phase of disease, a personal neglect can also be observed in patients with left brain damage.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70240-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
11893919,Feeling touches in someone else's hand.,"Bottini, Gabriella; Bisiach, Edoardo; Sterzi, Roberto; Vallar, Giuseppe",Bottini,"Cerebral damage may induce a delusional belief so that patients claim that their limbs contralateral to the side of the lesion belong to someone else (somatoparaphrenia). This disorder, which is not due to a general delirium, is frequently accompanied by the inability to feel tactile sensations in the 'non-belonging' part of the body. We report the unique case of a patient with somatoparaphrenia in whom dense tactile imperception in the left hand dramatically recovered when she was instructed to report touches delivered to her niece's hand, rather than to her own hand. We suggest that, through this verbal instruction, the mismatch between the patient's belief about the ownership of her left hand and her ability to perceive touch on it was transiently recomposed. This is evidence that apparently elementary deficits, such as hemianesthesia, and selective delusional behavior, such as somatoparaphrenia, may both originate from an impairment of the body image.",{},,Neuroreport,10.1097/00001756-200202110-00015,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
10703014,[Somatoparaphrenia. A positive variant of anosognosia for hemiplegia].,"Paulig, M; Weber, M; Garbelotto, S",Paulig,"Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP), i.e., unawareness of motor deficits and associated disorders, has been frequently reported, pre-dominantly following right hemispheric lesions. To a smaller extent, there are case reports of patients who give accounts of a feeling of strangeness concerning the contralesional limbs and sometimes attribute them to other persons. This ""positive-variant"" of AHP has been labeled ""somatoparaphrenia"" (SP). We report a case of SP in a 85-year-old woman with infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior parts of the right thalamus. She showed AHP and described her left side alternatively as her handicapped nephew and a clumsy cat. Misidentification of her daughter also occurred. With respect to the literature the predominant neuroanatomical features involved are lesions including right parietal cortex and/or posterior parts of the thalamus. Theories concerning the pathogenesis of this phenomenon comprise a denial of the illness, a lack of awareness caused by reduced sensory feedback and neglect, a misidentification or disturbance of the active discovery process considered necessary for realizing one's disorder.",{},,Der Nervenarzt,10.1007/s001150050018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,ger
