38289491,Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and brain lesions compatible with multiple sclerosis.,"von Zedtwitz, Katharina; Tebartz van Elst, Ludger; Urbach, Horst; Groppa, Sergiu; Schiele, Miriam A; Prüss, Harald; Domschke, Katharina; Stich, Oliver; Hannibal, Luciana; Endres, Dominique",von Zedtwitz,"Autoimmune-mediated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can occur in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",10.1007/s00702-023-02737-z,PMC10874305,Autoimmune; CSF; Inflammation; Multiple sclerosis; OCD; RIS,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Austria,eng

Case report and literature review. We describe the case of a 58-year-old, right-handed man developed OCD 17 months after stroke resulting from lesion of the right middle cerebral artery infarction. The patient was successfully treated with sertraline up to 50 mg per day. His OCD behaviors largely reduced in 6 weeks, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score was reduced from 29 to 12 in 1 year. A literature review revealed 21 previous cases of OCD following CVA. Among these, consistent with our case, the basal ganglia was the most common site of the lesion responsible for the development of this rare disorder. We discuss the patient's treatment and outcomes. Our present case and a literature review suggest that OCD can manifest following CVA, although further studies are necessary. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to be effective in treating this rare disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2018.12.034,,Obsessive-compulsive disorder; basal ganglia; cerebrovascular accident; sertraline; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Informed by CARE guidelines, we present the case of a boy in his late adolescence who sustained a severe TBI from a motor vehicle crash. His injuries required a prolonged stay in the hospital, including 3 weeks in the intensive care unit and a craniotomy to evacuate a large subdural haematoma. Obsessive-compulsive behaviours were first observed on discharge from the hospital and became worse over time. Compulsive behaviours were considered in light of a neuropsychological examination, and a diagnosis of OCD was attained. Sertraline was prescribed and effectively reduced the severity of OCD symptoms. Given the challenges comorbid conditions can pose to neurorehabilitation, a better understanding of patterns in OCD symptoms and brain lesions among reported cases will help guide the diagnosis of OCD among individuals with severe TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2023-256834,PMC10806976,Anxiety disorders (including OCD and PTSD); Neurological injury; Neurology; Trauma CNS /PNS,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 33-year-old woman showed symptoms of OCD, including obsessive worry about infection from tainted blood and repetitive confirmation, which worsened during pregnancy. She had comprehension in regard to her illness and no evidence of cognitive dysfunction and did not meet other DSM-5 criteria such as depression. One month after giving childbirth, the symptoms worsened, while headache and dizziness also developed. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score was 34. The patient was examined for a headache and a posterior cranial fossa meningioma was found. Following resection of the meningioma, the OCD symptoms were remarkably reduced (Y-BOCS score 10).

We present the case of a 31-year-old male veteran with PTSD who reported TBI before entering the military. The reported injury appeared to be mild: He was struck on the head by a baseball, losing consciousness for ∼10 seconds. Years later, he developed severe PTSD after combat exposure. He was not receiving clinical services for these issues but was encountered in the context of a research study. We conducted cognitive, autonomic, and MRI assessments to assess brain function, structure, and neurophysiology. Next, we compared amygdala volume, uncinate fasciculus diffusion, functional connectivity, facial affect recognition, and baroreceptor coherence with those of a control group of combat veterans (n = 23). Our veteran's MRI revealed a large right medial-orbital prefrontal lesion with surrounding atrophy, which the study neuroradiologist interpreted as likely caused by traumatic injury. Comparison with controls indicated disrupted structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal-limbic structures and impaired emotional, cognitive, and autonomic responses. Detection of this injury before combat would have been unlikely in a clinical context because our veteran had reported a phenomenologically mild injury, and PTSD is a simple explanation for substance abuse, sleep impairment, and psychosocial distress. However, it may be that right prefrontal-limbic disruption imparted vulnerability for the development of PTSD and exacerbated our veteran's emotional response to, and recovery from, PTSD.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000264,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

One aspect of poststroke psychosis is delusional infestation (DI), also known as delusional parasitosis. Patients with DI have fixed sensations that they get infested by lice. Some explanations of DI indicate that striatal and fronto-cortical structural and functional abnormalities are related to DI symptomatology. In this case report, we present a patient with DI due to right intracarotid artery occlusion, which is detected radiologically. Before treatment with escitalopram and risperidone, the case had a frontal slowing in quantitative electroencephalography activity, which was normalized after 2 weeks of treatment.

His obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved, but his condition evolved with a manic episode, cognitive memory changes, visual hallucinations, confabulation, and frontal lobe symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain edema in the left hemisphere and a 6-mm brain cyst in the right hemisphere at postoperative month 20.

30345063,The role of cerebellar impairment in emotion processing: a case study.,"Gold, Alexandra K; Toomey, Rosemary",Gold,"Though the cerebellum's role in visuospatial and fine motor functioning has been well-established over the last several years, the role of the cerebellum in emotion has more recently been a focus of scientific inquiry. Cerebellar impairment has been associated with deficits in emotional processing and is linked to a wide range of clinical behaviors including social withdrawal, blunted emotional expression, and impulsivity. In addition, cerebellar impairments have been associated with the onset of psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder and, more recently, obsessive-compulsive disorder. We describe a 32-year-old patient who presented to our clinic for a neuropsychological evaluation with a childhood history of a cerebellar brain tumor and detail-oriented, perfectionistic tendencies. Neuropsychological assessment data revealed impairments in visuospatial processing and in fine motor skills, likely stemming from the cerebellar tumor. Clinical assessment led to a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and also suggested impairments in socio-emotional processing. Our findings lend support to recent data which has suggested the impact of cerebellar impairment on emotional processing and related domains. Unlike many previous studies, however, our report focuses on an individual who, despite having marked impairments in certain domains, demonstrates a high level of functioning. We believe that this report holds important clinical relevance for proper diagnosis of cerebellar-related impairment and for the necessity of early intervention.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cerebellum & ataxias,10.1186/s40673-018-0090-1,PMC6186118,Cerebellum; Emotion; Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,Case Reports,England,eng

The pathophysiology of OCD involves many distinct cortical and subcortical regions and it has been reported that OCD may occur as a consequence of traumatic brain injury, infections and tumors as well as cerebrovascular insult such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We here describe the case of a 36-year-old woman who developed OCD at the age of 13 with almost complete remission of the symptoms after a 1 year-long treatment. Interestingly, after suffering CVST at the superior sagittal sinus at the age of 33, she experienced a relapse of OCD. The patient was successfully treated with Sertraline and Clomipramine. Previous studies revealed cases of OCD following different cerebrovascular accidents, i.e. predominantly arterial stroke. However, the present case is the first to describe OCD after venous thrombosis.

20714032,[Anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis].,"Yamamoto, Tomotaka; Tsuji, Shoji",Yamamoto,"Anti-Ma2-associated encephalitis (or anti-Ma2 encephalitis) is a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) characterized by isolated or combined limbic, diencephalic, or brainstem dysfunction. Anti-Ma2 antibodies detected in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of patients are highly specific for this disease entity and belong to a group of well-characterized onconeuronal antibodies (or classical antibodies). The corresponding antigen, Ma2 is selectively expressed intracellularly in neurons and tumors as is the case with other onconeuronal antigens targeted by classical antibodies. However, in most cases the clinical pictures are different from those of classical PNS and this creates a potential risk of underdiagnosis. Although limbic dysfunction is the most common manifestation in patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis which is one of the major causes of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (LE), it has been reported that less than 30% of the patients with anti-Ma2 LE exhibit clinical presentations typical of the classical description of LE. Of the remaining, many exhibit excessive daytime sleepiness, vertical ophthalmoparesis, or both associated with LE, because of frequent involvement of the diencephalon and/or upper brainstem. Anti-Ma2 LE can also be manifested as a pure psychiatric disturbance such as obsessive-compulsive disorder in a few cases. Some patients develop mesodiencephalic encephalitis with minor involvement of the limbic system, and some may manifest severe hypokinesis. About 40% of the patients with anti-Ma2 antibodies also have antibodies against different epitopes on Ma1, a homologue of Ma2. These patients may have predominant cerebellar and/or brainstem dysfunctions due to more extensive involvement of subtentorial structures. Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is outstanding among other PNS associated with classical antibodies in that the response rate to treatment is relatively high. While it can cause severe neurological deficits or death in a substantial proportion of the patients, approximately one-third show neurological improvement and another 20 - 40% stabilize in response to treatment, including immunotherapy and/or tumor treatment. Patients who have limited CNS involvement and testicular tumors with complete response to therapy are more likely to show neurological improvement. This fact emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy. However, it should be noted that even carcinoma in situ, which is difficult to detect can cause severe neurological disorders. In this respect, it is useful to highlight that anti-Ma2 encephalitis is almost always associated with testicular germ cell tumors in men younger than 50 years. We experienced a 40-year-old patient with severe hypokinesis caused by anti-Ma2 encephalitis associated with bilateral intratubular germ-cell neoplasm of the testes. In older men and women, non-small-cell lung cancer is most common but various types of cancers are reported to be associated. In this study,in addition to reviewing the above case we have reviewed the significance of anti-Ma2 antibodies in the diagnosis of anti-Ma2 encephalitis and the clinical features of this disease.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

While semantic dementia and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia are classically related to this syndrome, the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia has been less commonly reported. This case report aims to give a pictorial description of a case in which a patient with asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy presented with the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and complex rituals of cleanliness. We report on the case of a 68-year-old, right-handed White woman with complex rituals and progressive speech impairment. The obsessive-compulsive rituals represented an exacerbation of lifelong preoccupations with cleanliness and orderliness that were praised by her relatives. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a striking impairment of language and memory, with relative sparing of tool-use praxis and visuospatial skills. Magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>18</sup>fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans showed bilateral asymmetrical temporal lobe atrophy and hypometabolism. A year later, she was still able to entertain conversation for a short while, but her vocabulary and fluency had further declined. Praxis and visuospatial skills remained intact. She did not experience pathological elation, delusions, or hallucinations. The disease followed a relentless progression into a partial Klüver-Bucy syndrome, abulia, and terminal dementia. She died from acute myocardial infarction 8 years after the onset of aphasia. The symptoms and their temporal course supported a diagnosis of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia due to asymmetric temporal variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

Based on results of longitudinal independent evaluations of the patient in several specialized clinical centers the disease was considered resistant to medical therapy. Radiosurgical procedure was performed by means of Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion™ (Elekta AB; Stockholm, Sweden). Ventral portion of the anterior limb of internal capsule was targeted with two 4-mm isocenters on each side, with prescription dose at 50% isodose line of 80 Gy and a maximal dose of 160 Gy. No obvious complications or side effects were noted during 13-month follow-up after radiosurgery.

A 15-year-old boy presented with severe OCD of recent onset. An infarct of the caudate nucleus was identified as the initial presentation of primary APS. This case report includes a selective literature review of the neuropsychiatric correlates of APS. The patient had OCD for 3 months with increasing symptoms resulting in admission for psychiatric reasons. After referral to the emergency department 3 weeks later, an infarct of the caudate nucleus was documented using magnetic resonance images of the brain, and APS was diagnosed based on additional laboratory findings. Anticoagulant treatment (enoxaparin and phenprocoumon) in this patient was effective in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptom severity. OCD may present as a neuropsychiatric manifestation of APS. The present observations are consistent with a thrombotic mechanism for neurologic or psychiatric symptoms in APS. In general, routine medical workup for childhood OCD is not indicated, but a comprehensive psychiatric, medical, and family history taking and physical examination are essential, particularly if OCD is of recent onset. The role of anticoagulant therapy in neuropsychiatric manifestations of APS without the presence of a cerebral infarct requires further research.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Psychosomatic medicine,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31828acfbc,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

36078557,Dementia-Associated Compulsive Singing (DACS): Presentation of Unpublished Clinical Cases Miniseries.,"De Masi, Roberto; Orlando, Stefania; Costa, Maria Carmela",De Masi,"Dementia-associated compulsive singing (DACS) is a neurotransmettitorial-based behavioral disturbance, characterized by an unabating melodic expression, occurring in patients that suffer from evolved dementia. Previously described only as a ""punding"" aspect of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) in the Parkinson's disease (PD), compulsive singing has now been described, for the first time, in four non-PD patients effectively treated with Haloperidol or Quetiapine. Unlike the DDS-associated conditions, in our cases DACS is not pharmacologically induced, being that all patients were L-dopa-free. We detected a diffuse hyperintensity of the white matter and brain atrophy, with insular shrinkage as well as ventricular system and/or sub-arachnoid space enlargement in our DACS patients. Furthermore, similarly to the other behavioral symptoms of dementia, DACS also seems to be correlated to the degree of cognitive and functional impairment, rather than its subtype. In conclusion, DACS is a non-cognitive, unpublished clinical aspect of evolved dementia, which is interesting due to the involvement of the extra-nigral dopaminergic system, resulting in an unabating altered behavior, but also to the enrichment of our knowledge in the involutional diseases of the central nervous system and their physiopathological manifestations.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,10.3390/ijerph191710844,PMC9517776,L-dopa; compulsive singing; dementia; dopaminergic circuit; punding,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. For patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. Further study of this approach seems warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2013.5.JNS13201,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging has revealed brain lesions in patients suffering from Capgras syndrome. This case study reports the findings of a thorough diagnostic evaluation in a woman suffering from Capgras syndrome and presenting with the following clinical peculiarities: obsessive modality of presentation of the delusional ideation, intrusiveness of such ideation (that even disturbed her sleep), as well as a sense of alienation and utter disgust towards the double. These characteristics bring to mind the typical aspects of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroanatomic investigation, through magnetic resonance imaging, performed on this patient showed alteration of the bilateral semioval centers, which are brain regions associated with the emotion of disgust and often show alterations in subjects suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, neuroimaging allows researchers to put forward the hypothesis of a common neuroanatomic basis for Capgras syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, at least for cases in which the delusional ideation is associated with deep feelings of disgust and presents with a certain pervasiveness.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S47293,PMC3742348,Capgras syndrome; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; obsessive-compulsive disorder; semioval centers,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

38255113,Sudden-Onset Acute Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated with Streptococcus and Brain MRI Hyperintensity in a Young Adult.,"Jory, Joan; Handelman, Kenneth",Jory,"Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal (strep) infections (PANDAS) are a recognized medical entity among children. But evidence for strep-mediated sudden-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in young adults is very limited. Delayed strep assessment and treatment may negatively impact clinical outcomes. We describe a young adult with acute sudden-onset OCD (age 24), treated unsuccessfully with medication and therapy for 3 years. At age 27, antistreptolysin-O (ASO) was tested, based on extensive pediatric history of strep infections. Antibiotic treatment was initiated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a new temporal lobe hyperintensity at OCD onset (age 24), which persisted at ages 25 and 30. ASO titers were elevated from age 27 through 29. Following Amoxicillin treatment, ASO initially increased. Subsequent Amoxicillin + Clavulin treatment produced improved OCD symptoms and treatment response, with no adverse effects. These results strongly suggest an association among strep infection, neuro-inflammation and sudden-onset OCD in this young adult whose response to medication and therapy was successful only after high-dose antibiotic intervention. Greater OCD remission potential may be possible with earlier identification and antibiotic treatment than 3 years post OCD onset. These findings add to the limited literature on strep as an etiology of the sudden-onset of OCD in young adults. They also lend urgency to increased frontline awareness for early strep and ASO assessment in sudden-onset acute OCD among young adults.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/healthcare12020226,PMC10815760,MRI; OCD; adult; antistreptolysin; strep; streptococcus,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Hyperactivity of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is assumed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of OCD; however, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Several reports have described the development of OCD after traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the pathogenesis of post-TBI OCD remains unknown. Moreover, patients with TBI often have a variety of sequelae, including cognitive dysfunction and mood disorders, which make the diagnosis and treatment of OCD more complex. We report the case of a 17-year-old Japanese male who developed OCD after traffic trauma. The patient developed a fear of contamination and checking compulsion after injuring his right OFC and left temporal lobe when he ran into a running truck during a suicide attempt. We believe that the patient's fear of contamination can be diagnosed as true post-TBI OCD. However, his memory impairment was significant, and we considered his checking compulsion to be strongly influenced by cognitive dysfunction due to TBI. We attempted behavioral therapy for OCD; however, sufficient results were not achieved because of the interference from the sequelae of TBI. It is not rare for OCD symptoms to appear after TBI. Differentiating the OCD symptoms induced by brain injury or cognitive dysfunction associated with TBI is important to determine a treatment strategy.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,PCN reports : psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1002/pcn5.199,PMC11177174,cognitive dysfunction; obsessive–compulsive disorder; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

We also attempt to test the mediating role of the cerebellum in the clinical presentation by manipulating the frontal-cerebellar network using MRI-informed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). <b>Methods:</b> A case report of a young adult male describing obsessive-compulsive symptoms, probably secondary to an infarct in the cerebellar right crus II, combined with an examination of behavioral and functional connectivity changes following TMS treatment. <b>Results:</b> Obsessions, compulsions, and pathological slowing were observed in the background of a posterior cerebellar infarct, along with impairments in vigilance, working memory, verbal fluency, visuospatial ability, and executive functions, in the absence of any motor coordination difficulties. These symptoms did not respond to escitalopram. MRI-informed intermittent theta-burst stimulation delivered to the pre-supplementary motor area identified based on its connectivity with the cerebellar lesion in the crus II resulted in partial improvement of symptoms with enhanced within and between-network modularity of the cerebellar network connectivity. <b>Conclusion:</b> We illustrate a case of OCD possibly secondary to a posterior cerebellar infarct, supporting the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of OCD.

The main features were inertia and loss of drive, with preservation of intellectual function. Some patients showed stereotyped activities with compulsive and obsessive behaviour which were sometimes highly elaborate in pattern. Extrapyramidal clinical signs were absent or mild. Brain damage, related to anoxic or toxic encephalopathy, was demonstrated by CT scans and MRI. The lesions appeared to be confined to the lentiform nuclei, particularly affecting the pallidum, although there was generalized brain atrophy in 2 cases. Positron emission tomography (PET) in 7 patients revealed hypometabolism of the prefrontal cortex relative to other parts of the brain. The PET studies suggest dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex as a result of damage to the lentiform nuclei. These clinical, anatomical and functional observations emphasize the role of the circuits linking the prefrontal associative cortex and some specific areas of the neostriatum, including the pallidum. The existence of distinct nonoverlapping circuits in the motor field or in the associative field can explain the fact that basal ganglia lesions may give rise to a clinical picture that is either purely motor, purely behavioural (as in some of our patients), or both. Similarities existed between some symptoms found in our patients and certain features of major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression, catatonic schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This raises the hypothesis that some aspects of these psychiatric disorders could be related to structural and physiological disturbances in the systems linking the frontal associative cortex and the basal ganglia.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/112.3.699,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

For this approach we refer to classic neuropsychology which deals intensively with problems of the will. Accordingly, patients suffering from brain injuries are confined to habitual activities which follow unintentionally from the present situation.

39156286,Concussion May Result in New-Onset Bipolar Disorder: A Case Report.,"Sabatose, Kent W; Cufino, Nichole; Hahn, Wendy; Ibatullin, Murat",Sabatose,"Emotional dysregulation following a concussion is well established. New onset of major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) post-concussion has not been investigated. BPD typically presents with an initial depressive episode followed by mania and concurrent depressive and manic states. Multiple theories explaining the etiology of BPD exist, including the diathesis-stress model (DiSM), though an accepted theory is not established. In this case study, medical records of a 50-year-old ambidextrous male with co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and a family history of BPD suffered a motor vehicle collision (MVC) resulting in a grade II concussion. New onset BPD was diagnosed one-year after a concussion following an involuntary admission and led to the patient self-terminating his medications and suffering a hypertensive crisis and aortic dissection, and stroke. One year later, the patient was again involuntarily admitted for a suicide attempt. Bipolar disorder persisted unchanged indefinitely. This case study may serve as a real-world example of the DiSM in the etiology of BPD post-concussion. We aim to highlight the importance of early identification of risk factors for progression to psychiatric conditions following concussion.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.64731,PMC11329324,adult concussion recovery; bipolar disorders; brain and bipolar disorder; concussion applications; diathesis stress model; diffuse axonal injury and traumatic brain injury; post traumatic brain injury; white matter injury and traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Compulsivity is part of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but may occasionally occur as stand-alone symptom following brain damage induced by cardiac arrest. In this case report, we describe a patient who developed compulsivity following cardiac arrest. We review diagnostic options, underlying mechanisms and possible treatments. A 65-year-old man presented at our clinic with continuous compulsive whistling following cardiac arrest. Neither obsessive-compulsive symptoms, nor other psychiatric complaints were present prior to the hypoxic incident. An EEG showed diffuse hypofunction, mainly in baso-temporal areas. Treatment with clomipramine resulted in a decrease of whistling. This case report illustrates de novo manifestation of compulsivity following cardiac arrest and subsequent brain damage and gives additional information on diagnostic options, mechanisms and treatment options. Differential diagnosis between stereotypies, punding, or OCD is difficult. Compulsivity following brain damage may benefit from treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

14611920,Behavioural disturbances following Japanese B encephalitis.,"Monnet, François P",Monnet,"Clinically, Japanese B encephalitis (JBE) is often overlooked as its occurrence in Western countries is rare. However, its neurological, cognitive and psychiatric sequelae constitute a major public health problem in the Far East where JBE is endemic. European and American subjects may however experience the JBE when returning from a Far East journey. In such cases, misdiagnosis is frequent because of the unawareness of psychiatrists and physicians. The present review, therefore, documents the behavioural and cognitive sequelae of JBE. This reactivates the debate concerning the vaccination against the virus all the more that the literature enlightens the importance of the vaccination for those who undertake frequent and extensive tourist excursions to the Orient but still discusses it for occasional travellers. Following is a case-report of a young western European post-graduate student who has contracted JBE by experiencing an acute febrile delirium during an unusual short stay in South East Asia. Pyramidal syndrome, Parkinsonism and amnesia were the prominent acute deficits. Whereas these faded in great part during convalescence, emotional and behavioural instability associated with affective involvement, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and cognitive impairments appeared. A partial recovery was however obtained with neuroleptics, lithium and following electro-convulsive therapy. Organic personality syndrome was persistent and thereafter constituted the main sequelae syndrome.

He suffered from a bilateral stroke within the territory of the anterior cerebral artery. His arterial system was characterised by a unique variant, whereby the right anterior cerebral artery was missing and three trunks originated from the left anterior cerebral artery, each bifurcating into right and left branches. An occlusion of the middle trunk immediately before its partition gave rise to a symmetrical bilateral parasagittal lesion that damaged the supplementary motor areas (medial part of Brodmann's area 6), sparing the lateral regions including the premotor cortices, the corpus callosum and the gyri cinguli. The hypothesis is put forward that utilisation behaviour should be conceived as a double anarchic hand, and its interpretation should rest on the damaged balance between the premotor cortices, responsive to environmental triggers, and the supplementary motor areas, which modulate actions and inhibit them. The imbalance due to the lesion would result in the patients being left at the mercy of environmental stimuli, unable to inhibit inappropriate actions. This intra-frontal hypothesis accounts for the data presented and those from the literature better than the previously held fronto-parietal equipoise.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70661-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

SLE can affect most organs, as well as the central nervous system (CNS). In this paper, we describe a patient with an isolated psychiatric syndrome in the context of SLE and discuss the role of antibody detection in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). <b>Case presentation:</b> The 22-year-old German male high school graduate presented with obsessive-compulsive and schizophreniform symptoms. He first experienced obsessive-compulsive symptoms at the age of 14. At the age of 19, his obsessive thoughts, hallucinations, diffuse anxiety, depressed mood, severe dizziness, and suicidal ideation became severe and did not respond to neuroleptic or antidepressant treatment. Due to increased antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) with anti-nucleosome specificity in serum and CSF, complement activation, multiple bilateral white matter lesions, and inflammatory CSF alterations, we classified the complex syndrome as an isolated psychiatric variant of SLE. Immunosuppressive treatment with two times high-dose steroids, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine led to a slow but convincing improvement. <b>Conclusion:</b> Some patients with psychiatric syndromes and increased ANA titers may suffer from psychiatric variants of SLE, even if the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE are not met. Whether the psychiatric symptoms in our patient represent a prodromal stage with the later manifestation of full-blown SLE or a subtype of SLE with isolated CNS involvement remains unclear. Regardless, early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive treatment are essential steps in preventing further disease progression and organ damage. Intrathecal ANAs with extractable nuclear antigen differentiation may be a more sensitive marker of CNS involvement compared with serum analyses alone.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00226,PMC6494960,neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); psychosis; schizophrenia; systemic lupus erythematosus,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

In the present paper we report on the case of a 43-year-old diabetic hypertensive man who developed an incomplete form of the Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. Whenever he lay down or withdrew the leg from the ground, he experienced the illusion that the left intermediate toes painfully twisted and mounted each other. Conversely, as he stood up or firm pressure was artificially exerted against the sole, there was a dramatic relief from the ""cramp"" whose illusory character could he be certain of only by looking down at the foot. By passively moving his toes into the referred position we realized that the experienced deformity conformed to the pattern of a fixed dystonia not outwardly expressed through the motor system. There was severe proprioceptive loss in the same toes that harbored the cramp. MRI showed the appropriate lesion in the posteroventrolateral thalamus (VPL) and wallerian degeneration of thalamo-cortical projections. SPECT showed hypoperfusion of the overlying ipsilateral parietal cortex as well as of the basal nuclei bilaterally, besides the expected image of thalamic exclusion. We hypothesize that the infarct disconnected the somatic sensory cortex (S-1) from critical proprioceptive input with relative sparing of superficial sensibility. Lifting the foot deprived S-1 of tonic inputs conveyed by undamaged contact-pressure pathways, a functional effect promptly reversed by placing the foot back against the ground. The case illustrates how a capricious deafferentation of S-1 by a discrete VPL thalamic infarct might facilitate the emergence of autochthonous activity.",{},,Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,10.1590/s0004-282x1996000300020,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Germany,por

The whole psychic picture however was quite different from that of the usual neurosis, since there was neither anxiety nor doubt, but a mental vacuum contrasting with almost normal intellectual and affective capacities. It was as though there was a loss of the auto-activation system of psychic life, postulated by dynamic psychologists. C.A.T. demonstrated bilateral pallidostriatal necrosis. This suggests that the striatum plays a motor and psychic role. In the field of motor control, its hypoactivity appears to determine not only chorea but dyskinesias similar to tics and compulsive movements. In the psychic field, the striatum appears to play the very general role of an auto-activation system of intellectual and affective life, its deficiency leading to mental activity of a compulsive nature.

On admission to the rehabilitation department, neurological examination revealed mild left hemiparesis, hyperreflexia on the left side and grasp reflex on the left hand. Neuropsychologically she showed general inattention, non-fluent aphasia, acalculia, constructional disability, and mild buccofacial apraxia. No other apraxia, unilateral spatial neglect or extinction phenomena were observed. An MRI demonstrated resected areas in the right superior frontal gyrus, subcortical region in the right middle frontal gyrus, anterior part of the cingulate gyrus, a part of supplementary motor area.

Auditory comprehension was fair with some difficulty in comprehending complex commands. Naming was good, but verbal fluency tests for a category or phonemic cuing was severely impaired. She could repeat words but not sentences. Reading comprehension was disturbed by semantic paralexia and writing words was poor for both Kana (syllabogram) and Kanji(logogram) characters. A significant feature of her speech was mitigated echolalia. In both free conversation and examination setting, she often repeated phrases spoken to her which she used to start her speech. In addition, she repeated words spoken to others which were totally irrelevant to her conversation. She was aware of her echoing, which always embarrassed her. She described her echolalic tendency as a great nuisance. However, once echoing being forbidden, she could not initiate her speech and made incorrect responses after long delay. Thus, her compulsive echolalia helped to start her speech. Only four patients with crossed aphasia demonstrated echolalia in the literature. They showed severe aphasia with markedly decreased speech and severe comprehension deficit. A patient with a similar lesion in the right medial frontal lobe had aspontaneity in general and language function per se could not be examined properly. Echolalia related to the medial frontal lesion in the language dominant hemisphere was described as a compulsive speech response, because some other 'echoing' phenomena or compulsive behavior were also observed in these patients. On the other hand, some patients with a large lesion in the right hemisphere tended to respond to stimuli directed to other patients, so called 'response-to-next-patient-stimulation'. This behavior was explained by disinhibited shift of attention or perseveration of the set.

The patients concentrated on the left side of their bodies, looking at it for long periods and relentlessly rubbing, touching, pinching, pressing, lifting, and manipulating parts of the left arm, trunk, and leg with their right hand or foot. They all had severe loss of elementary sensation on the left (touch, pain, temperature, vibration, position). The behaviour was not associated with overinterest in the left hemispace apart from their own bodies. It lasted no more than a few days, disappearing when left sided sensation improved. The findings suggest an association between sensory dysfunction and this ""acute hemiconcern"". None of 13 patients with a mirror infarct in the left hemisphere and none of 38 patients with acute hemisensory loss due to thalamic capsular or brainstem stroke showed hemiconcern behaviour. This behaviour may result from a feeling of strangeness critically associated with hemisensory loss without hemispatial neglect, due to involvement of the right anterior parietotemporal region.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.58.4.428,PMC1073427,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This drug was given within 24 hours of discontinuation of high-dose fluoxetine, both of which are known to enhance serotonergic tone in the central nervous system.

A new case].,"Laplane, D; Boulliat, J; Baron, J C; Pillon, B; Baulac, M",Laplane,"Another case of obsessive behaviour as the consequence of lentiform nuclei lesions is reported. All the aspects of an obsessive neurosis were present: irresistible compulsiveness, acute anxiety in case of non accomplishment, magic-like clues. The symptoms appeared after a carbon monoxide poisoning, in a 31-years-old woman who had previously a pathological personality, of the psychopathic type, but without obsessive features. The onset of compulsions was paralleled by frontal-like psychological changes, but there was no reduction of intellectual or mnesic functions. A previous depressive state continued after the poisoning, so that the patient did not show an empty mind as did the other patients; the loss of ""self-psychic activation"" was only partial. All these case-reports emphasize the fact that the neuropsychological testing must not be limited to the behaviour and must investigate the ""mental content"" as well. They also lead us to emphasize similitudes between psychic disorders related to lenticular lesions and those related to frontal lobe lesions, including obsessive-like activities. Such case-reports provide a model in which some components of the obsessive neurosis, hebephrenia and depression are the consequence of an identified brain damage. It can be suggested that the neural circuits involving frontal lobes and parts of the neostriatum and of the pallidum are implicated in the mechanisms of these three types of psychoses.",{},,L'Encephale,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

He demonstrated characteristic clinical features of MLC during childhood, such as slowly progressive megalencepaly, motor impairment with ataxia and spasticity, mild mental retardation, and well-controlled epilepsy. Thereafter, he showed specific neuropsychological symptoms, such as motor and vocal tics, compulsive behavior, perseveration, acquired stuttering, and dystonia since the age of 12. His performance abilities had been unchanged but his verbal abilities had degraded during the past 14 years. Higher cortical dysfunction tests revealed a frontal lobe dysfunction. On repeated brain MRI, a leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts remained stationary from infancy. On single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a hypoperfusion in the frontal lobe was detected at the age of 3.5 and 17, but the severity of hypoperfusion was also unchanged, respectively. Our results indicate that the frontal lobe dysfunction may be relevant to the late-onset neuropsychological symptoms with MLC.",{},,Neuropediatrics,10.1055/s-2006-955930,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Causality assessment was performed using an adverse drug reaction probability scale, as well as clinical and radiologic parameters. A 31-year-old white man, who had been receiving paroxetine 200 mg/day over a period of 3 years, developed ischemic stroke involving left middle cerebral artery. The second patient was a 46-year-old white woman with a history of recurrent depression who developed delirium and ischemic stroke while she was taking a combination of paroxetine 50 mg/day, trazodone 200 mg/day, and bupropion 150 mg/day. Carotid and cardiothromboembolism were found to be the major etiological factors for ischemic stroke. Accounting for the temporal relation, prior reports of SSRI treatment-associated CV-ADRs, and the pharmacologic action of serotonin on coagulation and the vascular system, the possible contribution of SSRIs to stroke in these patients was considered. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale revealed that a CV-ADR was possible. However, the nature of the stroke, plus clinical and radiologic findings, were inconsistent with known pathophysiologic mechanisms linking SSRIs and stroke in these patients. Causality assessment may improve unbiased recognition, management, and voluntary reporting of infrequent adverse effects such as SSRI treatment-related cerebrovascular accident.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,10.1345/aph.1D624,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

3765895,[Treatment of compulsive eating disorders in an autistic girl by combining behavior therapy and pharmacotherapy. Case report].,"Hackler, J",Hackler,"A young adolescent girl (13.5 years old) with a compulsive eating disorder and gross obesity was treated with a combination of behavior therapy and fenfluramine (Ponderax). The behavior modification program used was adapted from Reiss's program, an approach that had proven effective in individuals with hyperphagia and overweight who had no additional emotional problems or brain damage. In our patient the problem was complicated by the presence of autism, with compulsive eating being particularly ingrained as a form of stereotyped behavior. We therefore decided to administer fenfluramine concurrently because it is known to have both an appetite-depressing effect and a positive effect on behavioral disturbances characteristic of autistic individuals. During inpatient treatment the girl lost weight and showed changes in behavior. The changed eating behavior was still being maintained many months after discharge and after fenfluramine had been discontinued. We assume that drug treatment provided an important kind of support for the behavioral treatment program. Further, we attribute the emotional stabilization in this autistic girl to fenfluramine. We now plan to extend this treatment approach to other subjects with similar problems.",{},,Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Switzerland,ger

Brain tumors presented by symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, focal neurological signs, or convulsions are usually first seen by the neurologist or less frequently by the neurosurgeon in routine diagnostic procedures. On the other hand, when psychiatric symptoms are the first manifestation in ""neurologically silent"" brain tumors, the patients are sent to the psychiatrist for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms and brain tumors are left misdiagnosed for a long period of time. We presented three patients with the diagnosed brain tumor where psychiatrist had been the first specialist to be consulted. In all three cases neurological examination was generally unremarkable with no focal signs or features of raised intracranial pressure. CT scan demonstrated right insular tumor in a female patient with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); right parietal temporal tumor in a patient with delusions and depression and left frontal tumor in a patient with history of alcohol dependency. Psychiatric symptoms/disorders in patients with brain tumors are not specific enough and can have the same clinical presentation as the genuine psychiatric disorder. Therefore, we emphasize the consideration of neuroimaging in patients with abrupt beginning of psychiatric symptoms, in those with a change in mental status, or when headaches suddenly appear or in cases of treatment resistant psychiatric disorders regardless the lack of neurological symptoms.",{},,Vojnosanitetski pregled,10.2298/vsp1109809i,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Serbia,srp

The EEG showed patterns typical of cerebral ischemia during the syncope and epileptogenic foci in both temporal lobes after sleep deprivation. It is difficult to distinguish between seizure and syncope associated with involuntary movements when making a differential diagnosis.

General intelligence, language and memory were consistently preserved, though the scores of the performance IQ and the visual memory were relatively decreased.

There was, however, no aphasia nor agraphia. When the patient attempted to perform gestures on order, she compulsively produced oral or written language. In this very unusual case, dominance for gesture and dominance for language were strictly independent, each ensured by one hemisphere. The patient's performances in gestual activities, especially dissociation between automatic and voluntary movements, and compulsive linguistic productions, are discussed in relation to this functional lateralization. We suggest that the propositional nature of the responses required in test conditions could activate either voluntary language in the left cerebral hemisphere, or voluntary gestures in the right. A competition between the two hemispheres could explain the patient's linguistic apraxic or behavior in response to orders.

In some patients with CO intoxication, but not usually, a biphasic pattern can be seen. In this condition, after antitoxic treatment, patients may completely recover and after a short recovery period, neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms appear again. This condition is known as delayed encephalopathy and its occurrence rate is between 0.06% and 11.8%. Herein, we report a case with delayed encephalopathy after CO intoxication, which began with neurological symptoms and continued with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, kleptomania, and psychotic disorder. The 41-year-old female patient had no psychiatric or neurological symptoms or disorders prior to CO intoxication. Increased signal intensity changes in the basal region of the left temporal lobe (including the cortex and subcortical white matter), globus pallidus (bilateral), and cerebellar cortical and subcortical white matter (bilaterally symmetrical) was detected on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, there were atrophic changes in both cerebellar hemispheres. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of kleptomania described after CO intoxication in the literature. We discuss the organic etiology of kleptomania and the other psychiatric symptoms of this patient in the light of recent research. We concluded that the kleptomania seen in this patient was related to concurrent lesions in the temporal lobe and globus pallidus; in other words, her kleptomania may have been related to dysfunction simultaneously seen in both the temporolimbic and frontal-subcortical circuits.",{},,Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Turkey,tur
