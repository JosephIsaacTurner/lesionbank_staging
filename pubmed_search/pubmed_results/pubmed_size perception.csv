34694463,Isolated post-traumatic astereognosis: a case-based review.,"Khormi, Yahya H; Atteya, Mostafa M E",Khormi,"Astereognosis is the tactile inability to recognize objects placed in the palms by touch with the eyes closed or blind-folded in the presence of intact primary sensory modalities. Stereognosis is usually considered a function of the contralateral sensory cerebral cortex. However, lesions of several anatomic areas and pathologic entities have been reported to be associated with astereognosis. Only two previous reports linked traumatic injury to isolated astereognosis: following surgical evacuation of traumatic parietal extradural hematoma and following bullet injury in the neck in 1992 and 1919, respectively. All the pertinent literature was analyzed, focusing on the relevant definitions, clinical spectra, pathoanatomical processes, assessment, management, and outcomes of astereognosis. Also, an illustrative case was presented. The case highlights isolated post-traumatic left hand astereognosis in a 17-year-old boy following a blunt trauma to the head which resulted in a non-hemorrhagic contusion of the right post-central gyrus. Post-traumatic isolated astereognosis is a rare and probably underreported sequel of traumatic brain injury. Neurosurgeons need to be more sensitive to the assessment and detection of subtle stereognostic deficits in general and in trauma patients in particular. Other anatomical areas, in addition to the contralateral post-central gyrus, may be considered in the pathogenesis of astereognosis with the involvement of the dorsal column medial lemniscus tract such as the brainstem, foramen magnum, and the cervical spinal cord. To the best of our knowledge, this rare case report is considered the second report on astereognosis following head trauma, and the third report on astereognosis following trauma in general.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,10.1007/s00381-021-05392-5,,Astereognosis; Morphognosia; Post-central gyrus; Stereoanesthesia; Tactile agnosia; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

2377286,Facial neglect.,"Young, A W; de Haan, E H; Newcombe, F; Hay, D C",Young,"Following a stroke, a retired industrial chemist, K.L., complained that faces looked ""different"" and had become difficult to recognize. Investigation of this problem revealed that it particularly affected the left half of a face as seen by K.L. Defective recognition of this (left) half was found for normal faces, chimaeric faces, and for half-faces presented in isolation, whether upright or inverted. The problem was apparent for both internal and external facial features. Further studies with chimaeric faces demonstrated inattention to left-side features in K.L.'s judgements of facial expression and of resemblance between faces. Moreover, the left-half of a chimaeric face was affected even when it was itself forming part of the face positioned on the right in a display of two horizontally aligned chimaerics. K.L.'s spatial contrast sensitivity function was within normal limits for his age. He did not experience differential difficulty in recognizing the left side of everyday objects or of car-fronts (another stimulus class demanding within-category discrimination between visually similar items that display approximate left-right symmetry). He was also able to sort left or right half-stimuli correctly into the categories ""human face"", ""dog face"", or ""tree"". Although K.L. had a left visual field defect, the problem with faces occurred within otherwise intact parts of his field of vision.

38406985,Neglecting the bottom space: an object-based disorder? A two-case observational study.,"Martin, Jennifer; Vuilleumier, Patrik; Assal, Frédéric; Ronchi, Roberta",Martin,"Altitudinal neglect is an atypical form of spatial neglect where brain-damaged patients neglect the lower, or sometimes the upper, part of the space. Our understanding of this phenomena is limited, with unknown occurrence across different reference frames, such as distance (peripersonal vs. extrapersonal) and system of reference (egocentric vs. allocentric). Two patients with acute bilateral (P1) or right hemispheric (P2) stroke, with signs of bottom altitudinal neglect, underwent an extensive evaluation of neglect within 10 days post-stroke. Assessments involved altitudinal neglect and unilateral spatial neglect (USN) in peripersonal space, exploring egocentric and allocentric signs and in extrapersonal space. Compared to a control group of 15 healthy age-matched subjects, patients showed allocentric and egocentric left USN in peripersonal space, and mostly allocentric signs of altitudinal neglect. No signs of neglect were evidenced in extrapersonal space. Altitudinal neglect could thus present as an allocentric form of spatial neglect, suggesting that allocentric representations may not only affect the deployment of attentional resources along horizontal dimensions but also operate along vertical dimensions. Future studies should deepen our understanding of altitudinal neglect, eventually leading to further unravel spatial processes that control attention, their corresponding brain mechanisms, and implications for patients' rehabilitation and functional outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2024.2315860,,Spatial neglect; allocentric and egocentric reference; altitudinal neglect; spatial processing; stroke,Journal Article; Case Reports; Observational Study,England,eng

However, it is widely accepted that the developing cortex has superior capacities to reorganize following an early lesion to endorse adaptive plasticity. Here we report a single patient case (G.S.) with near normal central field vision despite a massive unilateral lesion to the optic radiations acquired early in life. The patient underwent surgical removal of a right hemisphere parieto-temporal-occipital atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the right lateral ventricle at four months of age, which presumably altered the visual pathways during in utero development. Both the tumor and surgery severely compromised the optic radiations. Residual vision of G.S. was tested psychophysically when the patient was 7 years old. We found a close-to-normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity within the central 25° and a great impairment in form and contrast vision in the far periphery (40-50°) of the left visual hemifield. BOLD response to full field luminance flicker was recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) and in a region in the residual temporal-occipital region, presumably corresponding to the middle temporal complex (MT+), of the lesioned (right) hemisphere. A population receptive field analysis of the BOLD responses to contrast modulated stimuli revealed a retinotopic organization just for the MT+ region but not for the calcarine regions. Interestingly, consistent islands of ipsilateral activity were found in MT+ and in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) of the intact hemisphere. Probabilistic tractography revealed that optic radiations between LGN and V1 were very sparse in the lesioned hemisphere consistently with the post-surgery cerebral resection, while normal in the intact hemisphere. On the other hand, strong structural connections between MT+ and LGN were found in the lesioned hemisphere, while the equivalent tract in the spared hemisphere showed minimal structural connectivity. These results suggest that during development of the pathological brain, abnormal thalamic projections can lead to functional cortical changes, which may mediate functional recovery of vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.033,,Contrast sensitivity; Cortical reorganization; DTI; Early brain lesion; Hemianopia; Neural plasticity; Retinotopic map; Visual cortex; fMRI; pRF,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

31125738,Regression of left hyperschematia after prism adaptation: A single case study.,"Di Marco, Julie; Lunven, Marine; Revol, Patrice; Christophe, Laure; Jacquin-Courtois, Sophie; Vallar, Giuseppe; Rode, Gilles",Di Marco,"Prism adaptation (PA) is a promising treatment in the rehabilitation of post-stroke cognitive disorders such as unilateral spatial neglect or constructional deficits. Right brain damage can bring about another representational spatial disorder, termed «hyperschematia», and defined by a left-sided disproportionate expansion of drawings by copy and from memory, and by an overestimation of left lateral extent when a leftward movement is required. This case study aimed at evaluating the effect of PA induced by prismatic lenses creating a shift to the left on hyperschematia signs. A 63-year-old woman with left hyperschematia, consecutive to a right fronto-temporo-parietal hematoma, was exposed to a leftward optical deviation produced by prismatic lenses. An anatomical MRI studied topography of the brain lesion; the patient's lesion was then mapped onto tractography reconstructions of white matter pathways. Results showed that PA significantly reduced the left-sided expansion of drawing by copy and from memory, and the overestimation of left lateral extent, immediately after prism removal and 4 days later, indicating a persistent long lasting cognitive effect. MRI showed a right hemisphere disconnection of the posterior and long segments of the arcuate fasciculus, and of the inferior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi. Overall, these findings suggest that: i) PA is effective also in hyperschematia by re-orientating spatial attention towards the right side of space, with a relative rightward PA-induced unbalance, and re-setting the spatial representation to the left side of space, contralateral to the side of the lesion; ii) the left misrepresentation of lateral extent may be related to a disconnection between visual coordinates and attentional networks to the frontal lobe.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.04.002,,Bottom-up; Hyperschematia; Prism adaptation; Space representation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We report a patient with probable posterior cortical atrophy who demonstrated lower right-sided quadrantic visuospatial neglect, together with allocentric vertical neglect. A 68-year-old man initially noted deficits in reading and writing. Subsequently, he developed other cognitive deficits. On vertical line bisections, he deviated upward, and on horizontal line bisections, he deviated to the left. These deviations together suggest that this man's neglect might be most severe in his right (head/body-centered) lower (below eye level) visual space. When attempting to perform vertical line bisections in all four egocentric quadrants, his upward deviations were largest in the right lower quadrant. On a cancelation test, he revealed bilateral lower (ventral) allocentric neglect but not egocentric neglect. This patient's magnetic resonance imaging revealed cortical atrophy, most prominent in the left parietal lobe. Previous research in stroke patients has demonstrated that the parietal lobes are important in mediating attention to contralateral and inferior visual space. The presence of left parietal atrophy may have induced this right lower (ventral) egocentric inattention as well as bilateral ventral allocentric inattention. Although to our knowledge there have been no prior reports of a patient with right lower quadrantic and lower vertical allocentric visuospatial neglect, patients are rarely tested for these forms of neglect, and this patient illustrates the importance of evaluating patients for these and other forms of neglect.",{},,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,10.1093/arclin/acz078,,Alzheimer’s disease; Neurodegenerative disease; Posterior cortical atrophy; Quadrantic neglect; Spatial inattention,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Although previous studies have revealed the impact of brain damage on artistic expression, few have examined the impact on artistic expression in terms of the perceptual and spatial components of either visual processing or visual imagery. Here we present the case of an artist whose artistic expression was dramatically affected following devastating posterior brain damage.

31726066,Three-systems for visual numerosity: A single case study.,"Anobile, G; Tomaiuolo, F; Campana, S; Cicchini, G M",Anobile,"Humans possess the remarkable capacity to assess the numerosity of a set of items over a wide range of conditions, from a handful of items to hundreds of them. Recent evidence is starting to show that judgments over such a large range is possible because of the presence of three mechanisms, each tailored to specific stimulation conditions. Previous evidence in favour of this theory comes from the fact that discrimination thresholds and estimation reaction times are not constants across numerosity levels. Likewise, attention is capable of dissociating the three mechanisms: when healthy adult observers are asked to perform concurrently a taxing task, the judgments of low numerosities (<4 dots) or of high numerosities is affected greatly, not so however for intermediate numerosities. Here we bring evidence from a neuropsychological perspective. To this end we measured perceptual performance in PA, a 41 year-old patient who suffers simultanagnosia after a hypoxic brain injury. PA showed a profound deficit in attentively tracking objects over space and time (multiple object tracking), even in very simple conditions where controls made no errors. PA also showed a massive deficit on sensory thresholds when comparing dot-arrays containing extremely low (3 dots) or extremely high (64, 128 dots) numerosities as well as in comparing dot-distances. Surprisingly, PA discrimination thresholds were relatively spared for intermediate numerosity (12 and 16 dots). Overall his deficit on the numerosity task results in a U-shape function across numerosity which, combined with the attentional deficit and the inability to judge dot-distances, confirms previously suggested three-systems for numerosity judgments.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107259,,Approximate number system; Density perception; Numerical cognition; Numerosity perception; Simultanagnosia; Subitizing,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

These advances allow three key questions to be considered anew: What brain areas in humans support the retrieval and use of remotely learned spatial information? Where in the brain are spatial memories stored? Do findings relating to remote spatial memory inform theoretical debates about memory consolidation?

However, evidence from animal studies also implicates PHC in spatial binding of visual information held in short term, working memory. Here we examined a 46-year-old man (P.J.), after he had recovered from bilateral medial occipitotemporal cortex strokes resulting in ischemic lesions of PHC and hippocampal atrophy, and a group of age-matched healthy controls. When recalling the color of 1 of 2 objects, P.J. misidentified the target when cued by its location, but not shape. When recalling the position of 1 of 3 objects, he frequently misidentified the target, which was cued by its color. Increasing the duration of the memory delay had no impact on the proportion of binding errors, but did significantly worsen recall precision in both P.J. and controls. We conclude that PHC may play a crucial role in spatial binding during encoding of visual information in working memory.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/bhx231,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

12916485,Neuropsychologic assessment of visual disorders.,"Lanca, Margaret; Jerskey, Beth A; O'Connor, Margaret G",Lanca,"This article introduces the reader to a sample of visual tests used in the neuropsychologic assessment of patients who present with various visual deficits. As discussed, patients often present with visual abnormalities that cannot be assessed exclusively during the opthtalmologic examination, partly because these problems extend beyond the fundamental aspects of visual processing. Visual problems occur in the context of focal or diffuse brain damage. Neuropsychologic evaluation can provide valuable diagnostic information and information regarding functional strengths and weaknesses. Many visual tests have been developed for clinical use. Some of these tests have been validated with lesion analytic or neuroimaging studies, which highlight the areas of the brain presumed necessary for task performance. Knowledge regarding the neural substrates of test performance allows the clinician to identify the neuropathologic correlates of test failure, which, in turn, is relevant to differential diagnosis. A profile of functional strengths and weaknesses emerges contributing to the treatment of the patient with a visual disorder. In this article, the authors present a subset of visual tests used primarily in the clinical setting. Some of these tests measure lower-level visual deficits (e.g., Judgment of Line Orientation) and others measure higher-level visual/cognitive deficits (e.g., ROCF). Although no firm delineation of test subtypes exists, the authors divide the tests into general categories of visuoperceptual, visuospatial, visuoconstructive, and visual attention/memory. Ultimately, it is incumbent on a trained neuropsychologist to select appropriate visual tests based on the patient's described symptoms and the referral question.",{},,Neurologic clinics,10.1016/s0733-8619(02)00109-3,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

32735814,Grip Constancy but Not Perceptual Size Constancy Survives Lesions of Early Visual Cortex.,"Whitwell, Robert L; Sperandio, Irene; Buckingham, Gavin; Chouinard, Philippe A; Goodale, Melvyn A",Whitwell,"Object constancies are central constructs in theories of visual phenomenology. A powerful example is ""size constancy,"" in which the perceived size of an object remains stable despite changes in viewing distance [1-4]. Evidence from neuropsychology [5], neuroimaging [6-11], transcranial magnetic stimulation [12, 13], single-unit and lesion studies in monkey [14-20], and computational modeling [21] suggests that re-entrant processes involving reciprocal interactions between primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate visual areas [22-26] play an essential role in mediating size constancy. It is seldom appreciated, however, that object constancies must also operate for the visual guidance of goal-directed action. For example, when reaching out to pick up an object, the hand's in-flight aperture scales with size of the goal object [27-30] and is refractory to the decrease in retinal-image size with increased viewing distance [31-41] (Figure 1), a phenomenon we call ""grip constancy."" Does grip constancy, like perceptual constancy, depend on V1 or can it be mediated by pathways that bypass it altogether? We tested these possibilities in an individual, M.C., who has bilateral lesions encompassing V1 and much of the ventral visual stream. We show that her perceptual estimates of object size co-vary with retinal-image size rather than real-world size as viewing distance varies. In contrast, M.C. shows near-normal scaling of in-flight grasp aperture to object size despite changes in viewing distance. Thus, although early visual cortex is necessary for perceptual object constancy, it is unnecessary for grip constancy, which is mediated instead by separate visual inputs to dorsal-stream visuomotor areas [42-48].","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Current biology : CB,10.1016/j.cub.2020.07.026,,V1; blindsight; dorsal stream; grasping; grip constancy; neuropsychology; object constancy; re-entrant processing; size constancy; ventral stream,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
25239855,Cingulate neglect in humans: disruption of contralesional reward learning in right brain damage.,"Lecce, Francesca; Rotondaro, Francesca; Bonnì, Sonia; Carlesimo, Augusto; Thiebaut de Schotten, Michel; Tomaiuolo, Francesco; Doricchi, Fabrizio",Lecce,"Motivational valence plays a key role in orienting spatial attention. Nonetheless, clinical documentation and understanding of motivationally based deficits of spatial orienting in the human is limited. Here in a series of one group-study and two single-case studies, we have examined right brain damaged patients (RBD) with and without left spatial neglect in a spatial reward-learning task, in which the motivational valence of the left contralesional and the right ipsilesional space was contrasted. In each trial two visual boxes were presented, one to the left and one to the right of central fixation. In one session monetary rewards were released more frequently in the box on the left side (75% of trials) whereas in another session they were released more frequently on the right side. In each trial patients were required to: 1) point to each one of the two boxes; 2) choose one of the boxes for obtaining monetary reward; 3) report explicitly the position of reward and whether this position matched or not the original choice. Despite defective spontaneous allocation of attention toward the contralesional space, RBD patients with left spatial neglect showed preserved contralesional reward learning, i.e., comparable to ipsilesional learning and to reward learning displayed by patients without neglect. A notable exception in the group of neglect patients was L.R., who showed no sign of contralesional reward learning in a series of 120 consecutive trials despite being able of reaching learning criterion in only 20 trials in the ipsilesional space. L.R. suffered a cortical-subcortical brain damage affecting the anterior components of the parietal-frontal attentional network and, compared with all other neglect and non-neglect patients, had additional lesion involvement of the medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and of the adjacent sectors of the corpus callosum. In contrast to his lateralized motivational learning deficit, L.R. had no lateral bias in the early phases of attentional processing as he suffered no contralesional visual or auditory extinction on double simultaneous tachistoscopic and dichotic stimulation and detected, with no exception, single contralesional visual and auditory stimuli. In a separate study, we were able to compare L.R. with another RBD patient, G.P., who had a selective lesion in the right ACC, in the adjacent callosal connections and the medial-basal prefrontal cortex. G.P. had no contralesional neglect and displayed normal reward learning both in the left and right side of space. These findings show that contralesional reward learning is generally preserved in RBD patients with left spatial neglect and that this can be exploited in rehabilitation protocols. Contralesional reward learning is severely disrupted in neglect patients when an additional lesion of the ACC is present: however, as demonstrated by the comparison between L.R. and G.P. cases, selective unilateral lesion of the right ACC does not produce motivational neglect for the contralesional space.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.08.008,,Cingulate cortex; Learning; Reward; Right brain damage; Spatial neglect,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
18817793,Visual extinction: the effect of temporal and spatial bias.,"Rorden, Chris; Jelsone, Laura; Simon-Dack, Stephanie; Baylis, Leslie L; Baylis, Gordon C",Rorden,"Unlike patients with neglect, neurological patients with extinction can detect a single event presented at any location. However, when shown two brief near-simultaneous stimuli they only report the ipsilesional item. The question of what inter-stimulus delay leads to maximal extinction has clear clinical and theoretical implications. di Pellegrino et al. [di Pellegrino, G., Basso, G., & Frassinetti, F. (1997). Spatial extinction on double asynchronous stimulation. Neuropsychologia, 35, 1215-1223] report that extinction is maximal when the two stimuli are presented simultaneously, with less extinction when either item has a slight temporal lead. This finding supports traditional clinical diagnosis (which only presents simultaneous events), and is in accord with theories of extinction that entail individuation of objects (e.g. ""token"" accounts). In contrast, Cate and Behrmann [Cate, A., & Behrmann, M. (2002). Spatial and temporal influences of extinction. Neuropsychologia, 40, 2206-2225] report that extinction is maximal when the ipsilesional item is presented slightly prior to the contralesional item. This finding appears to support disengage models of attention. Our aim was to reveal whether the difference between these studies reflects different patients, or different methods. Specifically, we note that the stimuli used by Cate and Behrmann were biased both temporally (more ipsilesional first trials) and spatially (more items presented in ipsilesional field). We examined the performance of nine individuals with extinction, and found that maximal extinction was not influenced by temporal biases, but extinction was modulated by the spatial location of stimuli. This finding reconciles previous studies and offers new insight into this syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.09.004,PMC2635918,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, such a function can be presumed, given the recently identified eye proprioceptive input to S1 and the established links between gaze and attention. Here we investigated a rare patient with a focal lesion of the right postcentral gyrus that interferes with the processing of eye proprioception without affecting the ability to locate visual objects relative to her body or to execute eye movements. As a behavioral measure of spatial attention, we recorded fixation time during visual search and reaction time for visual discrimination in lateral displays. In contrast to a group of age-matched controls, the patient showed a gradient in looking time and in visual sensitivity toward the midline. Because an attention bias in the opposite direction, toward the ipsilesional space, occurs in patients with spatial neglect, in a second study, we asked whether the incidental coinjury of S1 together with the neglect-typical perisylvian lesion leads to a milder neglect. A voxelwise lesion behavior mapping analysis of a group of right-hemisphere stroke patients supported this hypothesis. The effect of an isolated S1 lesion on visual exploration and visual sensitivity as well as the modulatory role of S1 in spatial neglect suggest a role of this area in visuospatial attention. We hypothesize that the proprioceptive gaze signal in S1, although playing only a minor role in locating visual objects relative to the body, affects the allocation of attention in the visual space.",{},,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1112-13.2013,PMC6619751,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Regarding action perception the most prominent hypothesis is that observed actions are matched to the observer's own motor representations. Previous findings demonstrate that the motor laws that constrain one's performance also constrain one's perception of others' actions. The present neuropsychological case study asked whether neurological impairments affect a person's performance and action perception in the same way. The results showed that patient DS, who suffers from a frontal brain lesion, not only ignored target size when performing movements but also when asked to judge whether others can perform the same movements. In other words DS showed the same violation of Fitts's law when performing and observing actions. These results further support the assumption of close perception action links and the assumption that these links recruit predictive mechanisms residing in the motor system.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Psychological research,10.1007/s00426-009-0231-5,PMC2694935,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

14662516,Out-of-body experience and autoscopy of neurological origin.,"Blanke, Olaf; Landis, Theodor; Spinelli, Laurent; Seeck, Margitta",Blanke,"During an out-of-body experience (OBE), the experient seems to be awake and to see his body and the world from a location outside the physical body. A closely related experience is autoscopy (AS), which is characterized by the experience of seeing one's body in extrapersonal space. Yet, despite great public interest and many case studies, systematic neurological studies of OBE and AS are extremely rare and, to date, no testable neuroscientific theory exists. The present study describes phenomenological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging correlates of OBE and AS in six neurological patients. We provide neurological evidence that both experiences share important central mechanisms. We show that OBE and AS are frequently associated with pathological sensations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one's own body. These include vestibular sensations (such as floating, flying, elevation and rotation), visual body-part illusions (such as the illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experience of seeing one's body only partially during an OBE or AS. We also find that the patient's body position prior to the experience influences OBE and AS. Finally, in five patients, brain damage or brain dysfunction is localized to the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These results suggest that the complex experiences of OBE and AS represent paroxysmal disorders of body perception and cognition (or body schema). The processes of body perception and cognition, and the unconscious creation of central representation(s) of one's own body based on proprioceptive, tactile, visual and vestibular information-as well as their integration with sensory information of extrapersonal space-is a prerequisite for rapid and effective action with our surroundings. Based on our findings, we speculate that ambiguous input from these different sensory systems is an important mechanism of OBE and AS, and thus the intriguing experience of seeing one's body in a position that does not coincide with its felt position. We suggest that OBE and AS are related to a failure to integrate proprioceptive, tactile and visual information with respect to one's own body (disintegration in personal space) and by a vestibular dysfunction leading to an additional disintegration between personal (vestibular) space and extrapersonal (visual) space. We argue that both disintegrations (personal; personal-extrapersonal) are necessary for the occurrence of OBE and AS, and that they are due to a paroxysmal cerebral dysfunction of the TPJ in a state of partially and briefly impaired consciousness.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awh040,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In drawing objects such as a daisy both from memory and by copying, patients exhibited a disproportionate enlargement of the left-hand side of objects and added more left-sided petals to the drawn daisy. This pathologic behavior persisted when the patients were blindfolded and was likely to reflect a perceptual, rather than premotor, size distortion. In a task requiring the perceptual matching of two rectangles, patients underestimated the left-sided stimulus. In a visuomotor task requiring the reproduction of the horizontal extent of a segment, patients exhibited a hyperextension, when a leftward movement was required.

Neurophysiological studies in animals and brain imaging studies in humans suggest that such filtering depends on top-down inputs to extrastriate visual areas, originating in structures important for attentional control. To test whether the posterior parietal cortex may be a necessary source of signals that filter distractors, we measured the ability of a patient with bilateral parietal lesions to discriminate the features of a target surrounded by distractors of variable contrast. In the presence of distractors, the patient was impaired at discriminating both grating orientation and faces, and the magnitude of the impairment increased with distractor salience. These attentional deficits are remarkably similar to those caused by damage to monkey extrastriate regions V4 andor TEO, which are thought to be recipients of top-down attentional feedback. In contrast to the effects of V4 and TEO lesions, however, the parietal lesions impaired performance even with widely spaced targets and distractors, a finding consistent with the projections of parietal cortex to visual processing areas covering a wide range of receptive field sizes and eccentricities.","DictElement({'Year': '2003', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2003,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.0730772100,PMC153081,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Given that spatial cognition includes a wide range of cooperating abilities, we deemed that M.S.'s spatial disorientation could be ascribed to specific alterations within this multicomponent system where landmarks and spatial frames of reference contribute to organize information for different purposes. M.S. and 12 healthy elderly people (NCs) were submitted to an extensive neuropsychological assessment and to 2 ad hoc spatial tasks: (a) Object-Location Memory Task (what, where, and their binding); and (b) spatial memory task combining categorical (nonmetric)/coordinate (metric) relations with egocentric/allocentric frames of reference (in verbal and visuomotor conditions). M.S.'s performance was compared with that of NCs by means of a modified t test to small control sample size. M.S. met difficulty in positional processing and binding but not in object recognition.

Although most of the findings were characteristic of associative visual agnosia with preserved perceptual function, the poor copying, contrasted to better spontaneous drawing, suggested apperceptive agnosia as well. Prosopagnosia, alexia without agraphia, Balint's syndrome, visual static agnosia and simultanagnosia were also observed. The patient had persisting amnestic syndrome, but no dementia or aphasia. The responses to visual stimulation were perseverations, form confusions and confabulations. Visual evoked potentials were severely, bilaterally abnormal and computerized tomographic localization showed bilateral lesions also.

We aimed to probe further distinctions between detailed and schematic representations of familiar environments in three cases of hippocampal/medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia by testing them on a route description task and mental navigation tasks that assess the identity and location of landmarks, and distances and directions between them. The amnesic cases could describe basic directions along known, imagined routes, estimate distance and direction between well-known landmarks, and produce sketch maps with accurate layouts, suggestive of intact schematic representations. However, findings that their route descriptions lack richness of detail, along with impoverished sketch maps and poor landmark recognition, substantiates previous findings that detailed representations are hippocampus-dependent.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.06.008,,Case study method; Episodic memory; Hippocampus; Navigation; Spatial memory,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

It has been argued that to a large extent these bisection errors can be attributed to a perceptual change whereby the patient experiences the left half of a line as shorter than the right half, causing them to set the midpoint of the line towards the right. We describe here a patient with a left hemisphere lesion and rightward neglect, who consequently makes bisection errors in a leftward direction. We carried out a series of tests which confirmed that he shows a subjective visual distortion in the converse direction, i.e. a perception of horizontal extents on the right as shorter than extents on the left. We also found that he shows a similar distortion in his tactile perception. The association of visual and tactile distortions in this patient is compatible with the view that the distortion effects have a rather high-level origin. Multiple single-case studies will, however, be required to establish whether this association of deficits is typical, or whether visual and tactile size distortions are separable symptoms associated with neglect.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.7.5.391.16246,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Examination on admission revealed amnesia of recent events, recognition memory deficits, emotional disturbance, right upper quadrantanopsia and micropsia. The patient was diagnosed as posterior cerebral artery territory infarction based on brain CT scan and MRI findings which showed an ischemic lesion involving the left occipital lobe and hippocampus. We regarded the quadrantanopsia to have originated in the occipital lobe lesion and memory and emotional disturbances to have originated in the hippocampal lesion. After admission, micropsia and disturbances of memory and emotion improved within a month, but the quadrantanopsia did not recover. A comparison of the 25th and 2nd day brain CT scans indicated that the low density of the ischemic lesion near the hippocampus had become less clear and smaller. These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of micropsia in this case was a visual perceptional abnormality due to edematous change in the structures near the hippocampus. Cases of occipital artery territory infarction with micropsia, disturbances of memory and emotion, and quadrantanopsia appear to be rare, but micropsia may be overlooked since it is often masked by disturbance of memory or emotion.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

In addition to a spatial deficit, such patients have also been reported to have a non-spatial deficit in temporal processing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these spatial and temporal deficits might be linked if the right temporal-parietal cortex is important in integrating spatial and temporal attention. In AF, a patient with an acute right temporal-parietal stroke, we replicated previous observations showing that he was biased to judge ipsilesional stimuli as occurring before contralesional stimuli. More importantly, for vertically aligned stimuli, AF more accurately judged the temporal order of successive ipsilesional than contralesional stimuli. Furthermore, his contralesional performance improved with stimuli with larger vertical separations. Taken together, these findings provide additional evidence that right temporal-parietal damage produces a processing refractory period for stimuli in contralesional space that extends in both space and time.

17354375,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

For instance, when shown 'hierarchical' stimuli comprising a larger global object (e.g. a large letter) made up from smaller components (e.g. multiple small letters), they typically report seeing one of the smaller components but not the global figure. Recent work on simultanagnosia revealed that global perception can be improved if local element spacing is reduced. However, it is still unclear whether the retinal separation or the physical (post-size-constancy) spatial separation is critical. Here, we presented various hierarchical global/local letter stimuli at different viewing distances and sizes to separate the impacts of retinal versus physical size. Our findings indicate a key role for visual angle in determining simultanagnosic perception. We observed that not only retinal spacing (in terms of visual angle) between local elements had a major impact on global perception in simultanagnosia, but also the physical size of the separation between local elements, provided that binocular cues to viewing distance were available. The results indicate both pre-size-constancy retinal influences and binocular-post-constancy influences upon conscious perception in simultanagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.02.013,PMC2877877,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In this study, we report two patients (MZ and CM) who experienced hemi-metamorphopsia for faces after a stroke in the posterior part of the brain. Despite the distortions, they could still match and recognize faces. We carried out a detailed evaluation of their visual-sensory status and found that both MZ and CM had specific problems with discriminating and estimating sizes and shapes, especially in the contralesional visual field. It was concluded that these cases, metamorphopsia was not due to a higher-order perception impairment specific for faces, but rather of a specific impairment in shape perception in the contralesional visual field that proportionally affects the perception of faces.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x256563,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Dorsal stream lesions can impair this process, but details of this neurocognitive relationship remain unclear. Here, we tested a patient with bilateral occipitoparietal damage and severely impaired stereopsis. We addressed four related questions: (1) Can distance and size perception survive limitations in perceiving monocular and binocular cues? (2) Are egocentric (self-referential) and allocentric (object-referential) distance judgments similarly impaired? (3) Are distance measurements equally impaired in peripersonal and extrapersonal space? (4) Are size judgments possible when distance processing is impaired? The results demonstrate that the patient's lesions impaired both her distance and size perception, but not uniformly. Her performance when using an egocentric reference frame was more impaired than her performance when using an allocentric reference frame. Likewise, her distance judgments in peripersonal space were more impaired than those in extrapersonal space. The patient showed partial preservation in size processing of novel objects even when familiar size cues were removed.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-009-1707-7,PMC2728930,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Germany,eng

Findings suggested that ""alternating"" allochiria in copying and drawing from memory tasks is an epiphenomenon of a basic inability to move attention and action away from the starting point of graphic productions.

Movements to central targets are typically less impaired. This disorder has been termed ""optic ataxia"". It has been suggested that a general deficit of online corrections under central as well as peripheral viewing conditions might be sufficient to explain this discrepancy. According to this hypothesis, patients with optic ataxia should demonstrate an impaired online correction of grip aperture under central viewing conditions if the target object changes its size during the grasping movement. We investigated this prediction in a patient with optic ataxia (I.G.) in a virtual visuo-haptic grasping task. We imposed an isolated need for online corrections of the hand aperture independently of positional changes of the target object. While we found some general inaccuracies of her grasping movements, the patient did not show a specific impairment of online adjustment of grip aperture. On the contrary, I.G. smoothly adjusted her grip aperture comparable to healthy subjects. A general deficit of fast movement correction affecting targets in peripheral as well as central visual fields thus does not appear to account for the overt visuomotor deficits in optic ataxia. Rather, it seems more likely that an anatomical dissociation between visuomotor pathways related to actions in the central and in the peripheral visual field underlies the dissociation of visuomotor performance depending on the retinotopic target position in optic ataxia.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.04.030,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Few studies have demonstrated a visuospatial deficit in WD and to date there has been no report of neglect syndrome arising from WD. However, recent studies have demonstrated that neglect is frequently associated with brain damage including the primary site of WD, the basal ganglia. KHs writing abilities were evaluated just after her admission to the rehabilitation department and 6 months later. The baseline evaluation demonstrated that KH had neglect dysgraphia with verbal stimuli (e.g., words or sentences) although her deficit was less evident in drawing multiple geometric shapes. Six months after the initial evaluation, KH showed evidence of neglect dysgraphia only when writing was associated with a secondary memory task. KHs writing performance is discussed with reference to previous cases of spatial neglect dysgraphia and in the context of spatial neglect.

In humans, the interaction between near peripersonal space representation and action execution can be revealed in brain damaged patients through the use of tools that, by extending the reachable space, modify the strength of visual-tactile extinction, thus showing that tool-mediated actions modify the multisensory coding of near peripersonal space. For example, following the use of a rake to retrieve distant, otherwise non reachable objects, the peri-hand multisensory area has been documented to extend to include the distal part of a rake (Farnè and Làdavas, 2000). The re-sizing of peri-hand space seems to be selective for tool-use, as directional motor activity alone (i.e., pointing without the tool) and visual/proprioceptive experience alone (protracted passive exposure to the tool) does not vary the extent of the visual-tactile peri-hand space (Farnè et al., 2005a). Moreover, the amount of dynamic re-sizing varies with the length of the used tool, and is specifically centred on the functionally relevant part of the tool (Farnè et al., 2005b). Here, besides reviewing and discussing these results, we report new evidence, based on a single-case study, supporting the idea that dynamic re-sizing of peri-hand space consists of a real spatial extension of the visual-tactile integrative area along the tool axis.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70468-4,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

However, accumulating evidence shows that neglect can also follow lesions of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) that do not directly affect this parietal-frontal network. Surgical studies in the monkeys have demonstrated that complete callosal resection combined with lesion of the right optic tract entirely deprives the right hemisphere of visual inputs from the left hemispace provoking severe left unilateral neglect. Here, through the detailed study of two patients we show, for the first time, that PCA lesions selectively affecting the splenium of the corpus callosum and the adjacent right primary visual cortex provoke severe neglect selectively restricted to the visual domain. No trace of personal, motor or representational-imagery neglect was found. Also at variance with previous case studies in which neglect followed lesion of the trunk or the genu of the corpus callosum, no restriction of neglect to tasks performed with the right hand, no left hemispatial limb akinesia, no tactile extinction for the left hand and no tactile anomia for stimuli explored with the left hand were observed.

In 1906, Hermann Oppenheim reported a patient with bilateral stereoagnosia (astereognosis) caused by a left parietal lobe tumor and proposed that the left hemisphere was also dominant for stereognosis. Surprisingly, few cases of bilateral stereoagnosia caused by a unilateral cerebral lesion have been documented in the literature since then. Here we report a 75-year-old right-handed man who developed bilateral stereoagnosia after suffering a small infarct in the crown of the left postcentral gyrus. He could not recognize objects with either hand, but retained the ability to localize stimuli applied to the palm of his left (ipsilesional) hand. He was severely disabled in ordinary activities requiring the use of his hands. The lesion corresponded to Brodmann area 1, where probabilistic anatomic, functional, and electrophysiologic studies have located one of the multiple somatosensory representations of the hand. The lesion was in a strategic position to interrupt both the processing of afferent tactile information issuing from the primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a and 3b) and the forward higher-order processing in area 2, the secondary sensory cortex, and the contralateral area 1. The lesion also deprived the motor hand area of its afferent regulation from the sensory hand area (grasping), while leaving intact the visuomotor projections from the occipital cortex (reaching). Our patient supports Oppenheim's proposal that the left postcentral gyrus of some individuals is dominant for stereognosis.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000135,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Consequently, akinetopsia, a defect of movement perception due to cerebral lesions, would be expected to comprise a range of motion-related defects. To address this issue we explored further the perceptual profiles in akinetopsic subject L.M. who has motion perception deficits due to extensive bilateral lesions of the dorsolateral visual association cortex that spare primary visual cortex, area V1. We used several different experimental procedures. Using random-dot motion stimuli, we showed that L.M. can still perceive global coherent motion and discriminate motion direction, yet these abilities fail even at moderate levels of background noise. L.M. also viewed a two-frame apparent (phi) motion stimulus known as a Ternus display. Her performance on this test suggests defective 'long-range' apparent motion mechanisms. These results are clearly in agreement with previous reports. Additional experiments showed that L.M. can still perceive 2-D shape and 3-D structure-from-motion (SFM). However, like motion direction discrimination, these abilities broke down at moderate levels of moving and stationary noise. Surprisingly, L.M. also had trouble perceiving 2-D shapes defined by non-motion signals including 'on' and 'off' transients, dynamic and static binocular disparity, and static texture cues.

7558655,Weak electromagnetic fields improve body image perception in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Neuropsychological studies have demonstrated that multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with various cognitive deficits and it has been suggested that it be considered a form of subcortical dementia. It is now recognized that visuoperceptive and visuomotor deficits commonly occur in MS patients particularly in those with chronic progressive course of the disease. The Human Figure Drawing Test has been employed in the assessment of generalized intellectual deterioration and specifically in the evaluation of visuoperceptive, visuospatial and visuoconstructional abilities in brain injured patients. I have demonstrated recently, on the basis of various drawing test, the external application of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in the picotesla (pT) range intensity improved visuoperceptive and visuospatial functions in patients with MS. In the present communication I present five MS patients who were administered the Human Figure Drawing Test before and after a series of treatments with EMFs. Prior to application of EMFs four of these patients' drawings showed distortions, poor perspectives, impoverished facial expression, and lack of attention to details suggesting poor body image perception related to right posterior hemispheric dysfunction. In response to the administration of EMFs the group demonstrated improvement in motor disability which was associated with a striking improvement in the drawing particularly the drawings of the face the perception of which is localized to the right parietal lobe. These findings demonstrate that treatment with pT EMFs improves body image perception in MS patients thus corroborating previous observations which demonstrated this treatment modality to exert beneficial effects on cognitive functions in patients with MS.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459508999807,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

27318997,Dorsal and ventral stream contributions to form-from-motion perception in a patient with form-from motion deficit: a case report.,"Mercier, Manuel R; Schwartz, Sophie; Spinelli, Laurent; Michel, Christoph M; Blanke, Olaf",Mercier,"The main model of visual processing in primates proposes an anatomo-functional distinction between the dorsal stream, specialized in spatio-temporal information, and the ventral stream, processing essentially form information. However, these two pathways also communicate to share much visual information. These dorso-ventral interactions have been studied using form-from-motion (FfM) stimuli, revealing that FfM perception first activates dorsal regions (e.g., MT+/V5), followed by successive activations of ventral regions (e.g., LOC). However, relatively little is known about the implications of focal brain damage of visual areas on these dorso-ventral interactions. In the present case report, we investigated the dynamics of dorsal and ventral activations related to FfM perception (using topographical ERP analysis and electrical source imaging) in a patient suffering from a deficit in FfM perception due to right extrastriate brain damage in the ventral stream. Despite the patient's FfM impairment, both successful (observed for the highest level of FfM signal) and absent/failed FfM perception evoked the same temporal sequence of three processing states observed previously in healthy subjects. During the first period, brain source localization revealed cortical activations along the dorsal stream, currently associated with preserved elementary motion processing. During the latter two periods, the patterns of activity differed from normal subjects: activations were observed in the ventral stream (as reported for normal subjects), but also in the dorsal pathway, with the strongest and most sustained activity localized in the parieto-occipital regions. On the other hand, absent/failed FfM perception was characterized by weaker brain activity, restricted to the more lateral regions. This study shows that in the present case report, successful FfM perception, while following the same temporal sequence of processing steps as in normal subjects, evoked different patterns of brain activity. By revealing a brain circuit involving the most rostral part of the dorsal pathway, this study provides further support for neuro-imaging studies and brain lesion investigations that have suggested the existence of different brain circuits associated with different profiles of interaction between the dorsal and the ventral streams.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-016-1245-6,,Brain lesion; EEG; Form-from-motion; Perceptual deficit,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Behavioral dissociations on different neglect tasks have been reported in the past, and the investigation of their respective anatomical correlates at cortical and, to a lesser degree, subcortical levels has been attempted in stroke studies. We report a patient with a neoplasm occupying the right ventral post-central gyrus and anterior supramarginal gyrus. The patient was admitted preoperatively with dissociation on the performance of neglect tasks, showing clinical deficits in the line bisection task and clock drawing, but not on the cancelation task. The patient underwent an awake craniotomy for tumor excision. Intraoperative visuospatial mapping was employed by applying direct electrical stimulation (DES) to the supramarginal gyrus and the ventral branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III) during the line bisection task. According to our findings, DES was ineffective at the cortical level, but it induced strong rightward bias when applied subcortically at the SLF III. By combining our preoperative and intraoperative anatomical and clinical data, we suggest that the posterior part of the SLF III might have a distinct role in the perceptual component of neglect. Our findings are discussed within the context of previous literature supporting the notion that particular behavioral features of spatial neglect are mediated by different white-matter connections.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2021.1984538,,Awake craniotomy; cancelation task; line bisection; neglect; tumor; white matter,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
2014049,Left neglect for near but not far space in man.,"Halligan, P W; Marshall, J C",Halligan,"It has been suggested that, among the many visual areas of the human brain, there might be one set of spatial maps specialized for 'near' (peripersonal) and another for 'far' (extrapersonal) space. A distinction between 'grasping distance' and 'walking distance', or between a 'reaching field' and a pointing or throwing field has commonly been made. Evidence for such a division has been found in monkeys. Unilateral ablation of the frontal eye field (area 8) produces a more prominent inattention (or 'neglect') for objects in contralesional far space than in near space; by contrast, unilateral ablation of frontal area 6, which receives direct projections from area 7b (the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobules) results in inattention to visual stimuli limited to contralesional near space. Despite predictions that comparable dissociations should be found in man, there has been no convincing evidence. We report here such evidence in a patient with a unilateral right hemisphere stroke. Within peripersonal space, he showed severe left visuo-spatial neglect on conventional tests, including the highly sensitive task of line bisection.

Here we challenge these suggestions by presenting a double dissociation between two neuropsychological patients with left (JT) and right (CB) parietal lesions and selective impairment of number and time processing respectively. Both patients showed an influence of task-irrelevant number stimuli on time but not space processing. In JT otherwise preserved time processing was severely impaired in the mere presence of task-irrelevant numbers, which themselves could not be processed accurately. In CB, impaired temporal estimation was influenced by preserved number processing: small numbers made (already grossly underestimated) time intervals appear even shorter relative to large numbers. However, numerical estimation was not influenced by time in healthy controls and in both patients. This new double dissociation between number and time processing and the asymmetric interaction of number on time: (1) provides further support to the hypothesis of a partly shared magnitude system among dimensions, instead of the proposal of a single, fully shared system or of independent magnitude systems which would not explain dissociations or interactions among dimensions; (2) may be explained in terms of a stable hierarchy of dimensions, with numbers being the strongest.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.014,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Rehabilitation was conducted on an individual basis in the brain injury unit of Beata Maria Ana hospital. Neuropsychological evaluation showed some difficulties not previously described together with these deficits, related to attention, working memory and executive functions, as well as topographic disorientation, lack of visuospatial coordination, distances perception disorders and difficulty to mentally rotate objects. The rehabilitation was AIMed not only at restoration but also compensation of visuospatial deficits, successfully achieved after treatment: patients were capable of returning to their daily activities, including their jobs. In patients with visuospatial deficits, a compressive neuropsychological evaluation seem to be essential to define the influence of the other cognitive domains over the rehabilitation of visuospatial problems. In particular, the reinforcement of processes related to attention control and executive functions could very important, give their contribution to the learning of compensatory strategies and assuming that those functions pay key role in the organization and supervision demanded for perceptual skills.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Spain,spa

It was present both when the hand was visible to the subject and when it was not. This deficit was much less marked if the neutral objects were replaced by usual objects of the same sizes. Finally, in tasks where she had to indicate with her fingers the size of visual objects presented as virtual images through a mirror, or the size of imagined usual objects, A.T. performed normally.

While the parietal cortex has long been considered a principal candidate for performing spatial transformations, the exact underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we investigated in a patient with a right occipito-parietal lesion the ability to update the visual space during vestibularly guided saccades. To quantify the possible deficits in visual and vestibular memory processes, we studied the subject's performance in two separate memory tasks, visual (VIS) and vestibular (VES). In the VIS task, a saccade was elicited from a central fixation point to the location of a visual memorized target and in the VEST task, the saccade was elicited after whole-body rotation to the starting position thus compensating for the rotation. Finally, in an updating task (UPD), the subject had to memorize the position of a visual target then after a whole-body rotation he had to produce a saccade to the remembered visual target location in space. Our main findings was a significant hypometria in the final eye position of both VEST and UPD saccades induced during rotation to the left (contralesional) hemispace as compared to saccades induced after right (ipsilesional) rotation. Moreover, these deficits in vestibularly guided saccades correlated with deficits in vestibulo-ocular time constant, reflecting disorders in the inertial vestibular integration path. We conclude that the occipito-parietal cortex in man can provide a first stage in visuo-spatial remapping by encoding inertial head position signals during gaze orientation.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.06.031,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Postoperatively the contrast thresholds for discriminating the speed of movement of drifting sine-wave gratings were elevated by greater than a log unit in the contralateral field with little or no change in the detection thresholds for the same stimuli. Contrast thresholds for opposite direction-of-motion (DOM) discrimination of a contrast modulated (CMod) grating (a 'non-Fourier' motion stimulus) were also elevated by about a log unit in the contralateral hemifield but thresholds for DOM discrimination of a sine-wave (luminance modulated, LMod) grating were unaffected. Contrast thresholds for orientation discrimination of stationary gratings (a non-motion task) were unaffected. This general pattern of results was found in two other patients following lateral occipital surgical resections. Eight other patients with occipito-temporal (two cases), parietal (three cases) and medial occipital lobe lesions (three cases) showed no difference between the two hemifields on any of the tasks. Comparison of the location of the lesions leads to the conclusion that damage to the lateral occipital gyri is responsible for the pattern of visual deficit observed. Damage to an extra-striate visual area concerned with motion perception (the human homologue of primate V5-MT) may have occurred. There has been no previous description of impairment of motion perception localized to a hemifield in humans.

However, there was also some indication that these patients were not generally agnosic for object orientation but were able to gain access to at least some information about objects' canonical upright. We studied a new case (KB) with spared knowledge of object identity and impaired perception of object orientation using a forced choice paradigm to contrast directly the patient's ability to perceive objects' canonical upright vs non-upright orientations. We presented 2D-pictures of objects with unambiguous canonical upright orientations in four different orientations (0 degrees, -90 degrees, +90 degrees, 180 degrees ). KB showed no impairment in identifying letters, objects, animals, or faces irrespective of their given orientation. Also, her knowledge of upright orientation of stimuli was perfectly preserved. In sharp contrast, KB was not able to judge the orientation when the stimuli were presented in a non-upright orientation. The findings give further support for a distributed view-based representation of objects in which neurons become tuned to the features present in certain views of an object. Since we see more upright than inverted animals and familiar objects, the statistics of these images leads to a larger number of neurons tuned for objects in an upright orientation. We suppose that probably for this reason KB's knowledge of upright orientation was found to be more robust against neuronal damage than knowledge of other orientations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(00)00043-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The patient was not able to indicate the darker or the lighter of two grey squares, even though she was able to see that they differed. In addition, she could not indicate whether the lights in a room were switched on or off, nor was she able to differentiate between normal greyscale images and inverted greyscale images. As the patient recognised objects, colours, and shapes correctly, the impairment is specific for brightness. As low-level, sensory processing is normal, this specific deficit in the recognition and appreciation of brightness appears to be of a higher, cognitive level, the level of semantic knowledge. This appears to be the first report of 'brightness agnosia'.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2008.12.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

In contrast, when bisecting lines under tactile-proprioceptive guidance, subjects err towards near peripersonal space, suggesting that normally attention is preferentially distributed away from the body during visual exploration but distributed towards the body during tactile exploration. A patient with ischaemic lesions, however, involving both inferior temporal lobes neglected far peripersonal and upper vertical space. He also demonstrated a motor bias away from the neglected space. These findings suggest that in man attention is spatially directed in three orthogonal axes (horizontal, vertical and radial), that attention may normally be unequally distributed in each of these axes, and that neglect may occur in not only the horizontal axis but also in the radial and vertical axes.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/113.1.191,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

While there is a growing body of evidence from studies of awake behaving primates that supports these proposals, direct evidence from humans has been sparse. In the present study we tested a patient with thiamine deficiency and a lesion of the SC, who performed both eye movement tasks (prosaccades and antisaccades, with or without a gap) and a covert spatial attention task assessing inhibition of return (IOR). For eye movements, the gap effect was disrupted, and abnormal saccade metrics occurred, with reflexive eye movements being disrupted moreso than voluntary eye movements. Each of these effects resolved coincident with thiamine treatment. The covert attention task revealed a complete absence of IOR. The unequal disruption of voluntary and reflexive eye movements supports the idea that oculomotor responses can be generated in an independent fashion by frontal cortical and lower level neural systems.

7583104,The McCollough effect reveals orientation discrimination in a case of cortical blindness.,"Humphrey, G K; Goodale, M A; Corbetta, M; Aglioti, S",Humphrey,"The McCollough effect is a colour after-effect that is contingent on the orientation of the patterns used to induce it. To produce the effect, two differently oriented grating patterns--such as a red-and-black vertical grating and a green-and-black horizontal grating--are viewed alternatively for a few minutes. After this period of adaptation, if the black-and-white test gratings are viewed in the same orientation as the adaptation patterns, the white sections of the vertical grating will appear pale green and the white sections of the horizontal grating will appear pink. The McCollough effect indicates that colour- and orientation-coding mechanisms interact at some point during visual processing; but the question remains as to whether this interaction occurs at an early or later stage in the cortical visual pathways. In an attempt to answer this question, we studied a patient who had suffered extensive damage to extrastriate visual areas of the brain, which had left him able to see colour but little else. Neuropsychological and perceptual tests demonstrated that the patient, P.B., has a profound impairment in form perception and is even unable to discriminate between 90 degrees differences in the orientation of grating stimuli. He is also unable to use orientation information to control his reaching or grasping. Nevertheless, P.B. can name and discriminate different colours reliably, including those used to induce the McCollough effect. After adaptation with red-and-green gratings, P.B. appropriately reported the orientation-contingent aftereffect colours, even though he continued to be unable to discriminate the orientations of the test patterns. These results indicate that at some level in P.B.'s visual system orientation is being coded, but it is at a level that he is unable to use in making orientation judgements or in visuomotor control. Given the massive insult to the extrastriate cortex in P.B., it is likely that the anatomical locus of the mechanisms underlying the McCollough effect is within primary visual cortex or even earlier in the visual pathway.",{},,Current biology : CB,10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00107-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Following a series of cerebral infarcts, patient DB presented with severe perceptual impairment, including dense apperceptive agnosia,prosopagnosia, and topographical agnosia. Despite these deficits, he could effortlessly name countries from their outline maps. Patient WH, who suffered from semantic dementia, had severe naming and comprehension difficulties, with extremely sparse residual semantic knowledge. Remarkably, the category of countries was preserved. First, we argue that, for both patients, this category preservation occurs at a semantic level. Second, we discuss our findings in the context of three current models of category-specific effects (perceptual, ontogenetic, and evolutionary models). We argue that the perceptual model (Humphreys and colleagues) cannot easily accommodate our findings. By contrast, the ontogenetic (Warrington and colleagues) and evolutionary models (Caramazza and colleagues) can explain our findings. However, some modifications to both models are required. The ontogenetic model needs to envisage a spatial channel for the development of map knowledge, which is anatomically separate from channels of other categories of knowledge. The evolutionary model needs to envisage the possibility that some categories of knowledge, such as countries, may not be prewired, but learned during ontogenetic development.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490495186,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This patient, who had relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage, showed the pattern of impaired recall but preserved item recognition on standardised memory tests that has been suggested by Aggleton and Shaw [Aggleton JP, Shaw C. Amnesia and recognition memory: a reanalysis of psychometric data. Neuropsychologia 1996;34:51-62] to be a consequence of Papez circuit lesions. YR was tested on three recall tests and one recognition test for visuospatial information. The initial recall test assessed visuospatial memory over very short unfilled delays and YR was not significantly impaired. This test was then modified to test recall of allocentric and egocentric spatial information separately after filled delays of between 5 and 60 s. YR was found to be more impaired at recalling allocentric than egocentric information after a 60 s interval with a tendency for the impairment to increase up to this delay. Recognition of allocentric spatial information was also assessed after delays of 5 and 60 s. YR was impaired after the 60 s delay. The results suggest that the human hippocampus has a greater involvement in allocentric than egocentric spatial memory, and that this most likely concerns the consolidation of allocentric information into long-term memory rather than the initial encoding of allocentric spatial information. The findings also suggest that YR's item recognition/free recall deficit pattern reflects a problem retrieving or storing certain kinds of associative information.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00099-8,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The former is defined by spatio-temporal variations of luminance and the latter by spatio-temporal variations in other image attributes such as contrast or depth, for example. Using neuroimaging and psychophysics we present data from four neurological patients with unilateral and mostly cortical infarcts, which strongly suggest that first- and second-order motion have a different neural substrate. We found that from the early stages of processing, these two types of motions are mediated by two distinct pathways: first-order motion is carried out by mechanisms along the dorsal pathway in the occipital lobe, while the second-order motion by mechanisms mostly along the ventral pathway. The data reported here also suggest that different cortical regions may be in charge of processing direction-discrimination in second-order motion defined by different second-order attributes.",{},,Progress in brain research,10.1016/S0079-6123(03)14414-7,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review",Netherlands,eng

We report a rare occurrence of a patient (NL) who presents a persistent unilateral neglect which appears to be limited to visual imagery.

The patient, who had a lesion in the right parietal lobe, showed no evidence of perceptual or personal neglect, although there was some evidence of visual extinction.

10395363,Impairment of depth perception in multiple sclerosis is improved by treatment with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields.,"Sandyk, R",Sandyk,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with postural instability and an increased risk of falling which is facilitated by a variety of factors including diminished visual acuity, diplopia, ataxia, apraxia of gait, and peripheral neuropathy. Deficient binocular depth perception may also contribute to a higher incidence of postural instability and falling in these patients who, for example, find it an extremely difficult task to walk on uneven ground, over curbs, or up and down steps. I report a 51 year old woman with secondary progressive MS who experienced difficulties with binocular depth perception resulting in frequent falls and injuries. Deficient depth perception was demonstrated also on spontaneous drawing of a cube. Following a series of transcranial treatments with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of 7,5 picotesla flux density, the patient experienced a major improvement in depth perception which was evident particularly on ascending and descending stairs. These clinical changes were associated with an improvement in spatial organization and depth perception on drawing a cube. These findings suggest that in MS impairment of depth perception, which is encoded in the primary visual cortex (area 17) and visual association cortex (areas 18 and 19), may be improved by administration of AC pulsed EMFs of picotesla flux density. The primary visual cortex is densely innervated by serotonergic neurons which modulate visual information processing. Cerebral serotonin concentrations are diminished in MS patients and at least some aspects of deficient depth perception in MS may be related to dysfunction of serotonergic transmission in the primary visual cortex. It is suggested that transcranial AC pulsed applications of EMFs improve depth perception partly by augmenting serotonergic transmission in the visual cortex.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459908994794,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, this assumption cannot explain why performance on visually complex Hanja was better than performance on visually simple Hanja in our patient. In addition, the patient did not demonstrate higher accuracy on Hanja characters with fewer strokes than on words with more strokes.

The magnitude of the patient's rightward displacement of his transections is linearly related to the length of the stimulus line, such that the longer the line, the greater the left 'neglect'. At line length 2'', the patient's transections are relatively accurate, and at length 1'', the transections cross the objective midpoint to give a reliable left displacement (= 'right neglect'). On some occasions, these latter transections are placed beyond the leftmost point of the stimulus line. We interpret the data in terms of two constructs: (a) an 'attentional boundary' placed slightly to the left of the objective midline; (b) 'representational completion' that extends to the attentional boundary.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(88)80040-6,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

In contrast, she failed totally in a locomotor map test and in a task in which she was requested to judge viewpoints of buildings. Her highly selective topographical disorientation was probably caused by the inability to identify a viewpoint of a particular building.

We report three cases of Balint's syndrome and the individualized rehabilitation they received. One patient developed symptoms of Balint's syndrome caused by bilateral occipitoparietal infarcts. In the two other cases the symptoms arose secondary to posterior cortical atrophy, a slowly progressive dementia with alexia and agraphia. All three patients initially responded to a multicontext treatment approach with intensive verbal cueing and organizational strategies with subsequent improvement in visual recognition, reaching and scanning. Continued deterioration from posterior cortical atrophy or a second infarction resulted in worsening dementia in two patients. Cognitive remediation was required as visual perceptual rehabilitation became ineffective. Clinicians should be familiar with Balint's syndrome and its various aetiologies.

Two tachistoscopic, divided visual field experiments were carried out on a partial split-brain patient with no damage to the right hemisphere. In the first experiment, image generation performance for letters presented in the right visual field (/left hemisphere) was undeniably optimal. In the left visual field (/right hemisphere), performance was no better than chance level at first, but then improved dramatically across stimulation blocks, in each of five successive sessions. This was interpreted as revealing the progressive spontaneous activation of the right hemisphere's competence not shown initially. The aim of the second experiment was to determine some conditions under which this pattern was obtained. The experimental design contrasted stimuli (words and pictures) and representational activity (phonologic and visuo-imaged processing). The right visual field (/left hemisphere: LH) elicited higher performance than the left visual field (/right hemisphere, RH) in the three situations where verbal activity was required. No superiority could be found when visual images were to be generated from pictures: parallel and weak improvement of both hemispheres was observed across sessions. Two other patterns were obtained: improvement in RH performance (although LH performance remained superior) and an unexpectedly large decrease in RH performance. These data are discussed in terms of RH cognitive competence and hemisphere implementation.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1993.1028,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In the present study, two patients with differing degrees of MTL damage were first exposed to pairs of highly similar scenes, faces, and dot patterns and then asked to make repeated same/different decisions to preexposed and nonexposed (novel) pairs from the three categories (Experiment 1). We measured whether patients would show a benefit of prior exposure (preexposed > nonexposed) and whether repetition of nonexposed (and preexposed) pairs at test would benefit discrimination accuracy. Although selective HC damage impaired learning of scenes, but not faces and dot patterns, broader MTL damage involving the HC and PrC compromised discrimination learning of scenes and faces but left dot pattern learning unaffected. In Experiment 2, a similar task was run in healthy young participants in the MRI scanner. Functional region-of-interest analyses revealed that posterior HC and posterior parahippocampal gyrus showed greater activity during scene pattern learning, but not face and dot pattern learning, whereas PrC, anterior HC, and posterior fusiform gyrus were recruited during discrimination learning for faces, but not scenes and dot pattern learning. Critically, activity in posterior HC and PrC, but not the other functional region-of-interest analyses, was modulated by accuracy (correct > incorrect within a preferred category). Therefore, both approaches revealed a key role for the HC and PrC in discrimination learning, which is consistent with representational accounts in which subregions in these MTL structures store complex spatial and object representations, respectively.",{},,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2958-12.2013,PMC3722491,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

19345939,Increased effect of target eccentricity on covert shifts of visual attention in patients with neglect.,"Hamilton, Roy H; Stark, Marianna; Coslett, H Branch",Hamilton,"Debate continues regarding the mechanisms underlying covert shifts of visual attention. We examined the relationship between target eccentricity and the speed of covert shifts of attention in normal subjects and patients with brain lesions using a cued-response task in which cues and targets were presented at 2 degrees or 8 degrees lateral to the fixation point. Normal subjects were slower on invalid trials in the 8 degrees as compared to 2 degrees condition. Patients with right-hemisphere stroke with neglect were slower in their responses to left-sided invalid targets compared to valid targets, and demonstrated a significant increase in the effect of target validity as a function of target eccentricity. Additional data from one neglect patient (JM) demonstrated an exaggerated validity x eccentricity x side interaction for contralesional targets on a cued reaction time task with a central (arrow) cue. We frame these results in the context of a continuous 'moving spotlight' model of attention, and also consider the potential role of spatial saliency maps. By either account, we argue that neglect is characterized by an eccentricity-dependent deficit in the allocation of attention.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2009.02.005,PMC2852117,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

As a result, the literature currently lacks reports detailing the correlation between subjective depth perception deficits and objective stereoscopic vision deficits in individuals with acquired brain injury, particularly those cases that are characterized by a clearly defined lesion. To investigate this relationship, we recruited three individuals with acquired brain injury who experienced depth perception deficits and related difficulties in their daily lives. We had them take neurologic, ophthalmological, and neuropsychological examinations. We also had them take two types of stereoscopic vision tests: a Howard-Dolman-type stereoscopic vision test and the Topcon New Objective Stereo Test. Then, we compared the results with those of two control groups: a group with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain and a group of healthy controls. Performance on the two stereoscopic vision tests was severely impaired in the three patients. One of the patients also presented with cerebral diplopia. We identified the potential neural basis of these deficits in the cuneus and the posterior section of the superior parietal lobule, which play a role in vergence fusion and are located in the caudal region of the dorso-dorsal visual pathway, which is known to be crucial not only for visual spatial perception, but also for reaching, grasping, and making hand postures in the further course of that pathway.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000369,,,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

Recent studies have suggested that lesion of white-matter pathways plays an important role in producing spatial neglect by causing a widespread functional breakdown of the network of cortical and subcortical structures that regulates orienting of spatial attention. Nonetheless, this conclusion is largely based on the study of patients who suffer combined grey and white matter damage and should be better corroborated by the study of cases with selective or predominant white matter dysfunction. Here, we describe the clinical and MRI follow-up of a patient who suffered left spatial neglect due to inflammatory Acute Disseminated Encephalo-Myelitis (ADEM) that affected the white matter. Recovery from neglect was matched with recovery from inflammatory white-matter dysfunction, despite a concomitant and progressive increase in cortical atrophy and ventricular dilatation. These findings confirm the role of white matter lesion/dysfunction in the pathogenesis of left spatial neglect.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.04.018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

To test this prediction, tactile detection tasks were administered to two subjects with right hemisphere lesions. Subject CB's left tactile extinction was investigated in conditions in which the degree of contact between the right and left hands and the spatial relationship between his hands was systematically varied. His left tactile extinction was significantly reduced by touch of the right hand. Similarly, extinction at the left knee was ameliorated by touch of the knee by the right hand; touch of the right foot had no effect. Subject NC's ability to detect a tactile stimulus delivered to the left side was systematically assessed in conditions in which the hands touched and the spatial relationship between the hands was varied. His ability to detect a touch on the left hand improved in conditions in which the left hand was touched by the right hand. This effect was not observed if direct contact between the two hands was prevented by inserting a thin cloth between the hands. For both subjects, placing the right hand in close proximity to the left hand or altering the spatial location of the hands relative to the body did not influence performance. These data demonstrate that the hand may serve as a conduit for attention and provide strong evidence for a distinct representation of the body surface that is at least in part independent of spatial representations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.06.002,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,England,eng

7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception. He is also impaired at recognizing objects presented from unconventional views, but recognition of prototypical views of objects, and color and form discrimination are normal, as is his ability to recognize faces. The anatomical characteristics of the lesions of these two patients permit a direct experimental comparison of the effects of lesions confined to the parietal or temporal pathways. E.W.'s and A.F.'s performance on the psychophysical and neuropsychological tasks discussed here supports the functional distinction between a dorsal and a ventral extrastriate system but additionally suggests the existence of a pathway involved in identification-from-motion that is separate from both the dorsal early motion/spatial analysis pathway and the ventral color/static-form pathway.",{},,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/4.5.555,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Although many investigators have claimed that distance estimates are normal or abnormal in some of these patients, many of these observations were made informally and the examiners often asked for relative, and not absolute, distance estimates. The present investigation served two purposes. First, we wanted to contrast the use of distance information in peripersonal space for perceptual report as opposed to visuomotor control in our visual form agnosic patient, DF. Second, we wanted to see to what extent her abilities to process distance cues were dependent on binocular vision, in light of Milner et al.'s (1991) observations of preserved stereopsis in DF, and Dijkerman et al.'s (1996) and Marotta et al.'s (1997) observations that her visual guidance of grasping may be particularly dependent on binocular vision of the target. We hypothesized that DF's visuomotor responses would show normal sensitivity to target distance, while her perceptual estimates would not. In the first experiment, we required DF and two age- and sex-matched control subjects to reach out and grasp black cubes placed at varying distances, or to estimate the distance of the cubes from the hand starting position without making a reaching movement. In the second experiment, we required DF and two age-matched control subjects to point as rapidly and accurately as possible to small LED targets which differed in spatial location, under binocular and monocular conditions. The results showed that, relative to the control subjects, DF's grasping movements produced normal peak velocity-distance scaling-when she reached for blocks which varied in depth or pointed to LED targets which were presented at different distances in depth. In contrast, in the cube experiment, her verbal estimates of object distance were poorly scaled, although they improved slightly under the binocular conditions.

(1998) suggested that the representation of space is distorted--i.e., dilated towards the left side. If perception of the velocity of a moving stimulus is due to a calculation of the distance covered per unit time in representational space, then a stimulus with uniform linear motion should be perceived as decelerating when moving leftwards in the visual field of a subject with left unilateral neglect. We investigated the perception of acceleration in a patient with left unilateral neglect and spatial distortion (revealed as relative left overextension in a line extension task) using a task in which the stimuli were right and left moving targets with variable acceleration. The patient's ability to perceive acceleration was much lower (higher acceleration threshold) for leftward movements than rightward movements. Fourteen months later unilateral neglect had improved, and the relative left overextension and decreasing acceleration threshold for leftward movements were reduced. By contrast, alterations in the perception of acceleration for leftward movements were not found in a patient with left unilateral neglect and left underextension and in a patient with right brain damage and left hemianopia. These findings in one patient with left spatial unilateral neglect and a relative left overextension in a line extension task are consistent with the hypothesis that representational space is distorted, with a disproportionate leftward expansion, that affects perception of movement.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70126-6,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

This behavior can be influenced by the presence vs. absence of targets on the (neglected) contralesional side (). As alternative explanations, the authors proposed (i) directional hypokinesia--the patient cannot perform reaching movements towards detected left-sided targets, and thus carries on canceling on the right side, and (ii) allochiria--the patient misperceives left-sided targets as located on the right side, and cancels them there. We report here data from a patient (EZ) that might confirm the second hypothesis. EZ was presented with 19 displays in which the number and position of cancellation targets on both sides were varied systematically. EZ showed motor perseveration while canceling, but this tendency did not vary across conditions. Interestingly though, EZ also drew cancellation marks in the empty space between the ipsilesional targets, and this phenomenon was significantly more intense when there were more targets on the neglected side. As EZ's comments suggested, such a behavior might reflect the attempt to cancel out delusional targets. Our speculation is that those objects were generated by allochiria.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.051,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The present research aimed to study neglect in situations where attentional resources are limited due to multitasking. We examined two patients more than 3 years after a right-hemispheric stroke. Both had received neuropsychological rehabilitation for left neglect and did not show any impairment in standard tests. We used a dual-task paradigm combining a peripheral target detection task with a central shape recognition task. Peripheral targets could appear in left/right positions but also in lower/upper positions. In patient #1, dual-task condition exacerbated left neglect and extinction. Patient #2 did not show any sign of neglect along the horizontal axis, but omitted half of the lower targets when they were presented simultaneously with upper targets under dual-task condition. This behavior reflects altitudinal extinction as the detection of single targets appearing either in upper or lower position was preserved. The present findings show that dual-tasking is a sensitive tool for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of spatial attention deficits, which are often overlooked by standard methods, especially in chronic stage.

Here we report the third long-lasting case of autoscopy in a patient with right occipital lesion. Instead of the commonly reported frontal mirror view (fantôme spéculaire), the patient saw her head and upper trunk laterally in side view (fantôme de profil). We found that the visual appearance and completeness of the autoscopic image could be selectively modulated by active and passive movements, without being influenced by imagining the same movements or by tactile and auditory stimulation. Eyes closure did not disrupt either the perception of the autoscopic body or the effects of the motor stimulation. Moreover, the visual body reduplication was coded neither in purely eye-centered nor in head-centered frames of reference, suggesting the involvement of egocentric coordinate systems (eyes and head centered). A follow-up examination highlighted the stability of the visual characteristics of the body reduplication and its shift induced by displacement of both head and eyes. These findings support the view that autoscopic phenomena have a multisensory motor origin and proprioceptive signals may play an important role in modulating the illusory visual reduplication of the patient's own body, most likely via cross-modal modulation of extrastriate areas involved in body and face perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn.2010.21569,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Against a background of a memory disturbance, but otherwise essentially intact linguistic and cognitive capacities, the patient was generally unable to identify single objects on visual presentation, and displayed marked difficulty in interpreting complex objects, depicted scenes, and partially occluded figures. The patient's preserved ability to recognize geometric forms, to perceive optical illusions, and to copy designs, and objects with considerable accuracy suggested the clinical picture of visual agnosia. An examination was undertaken of the effects of this recognition disorder on the artist's capacity to draw. Despite an inability to recognize an object or scene, the patient retained various techniques (perspective, shadowing, designation of texture) which allowed him to copy the display in a veridical fashion. When displays were recognized, or when the patient was given only the name of the object and asked to draw it, he adopted a less slavish approach, characteristic of his pre-morbid artwork. While his post-morbid drawings bore a strong similarity to his earlier works, such features as insufficient differentiation of figure from ground, over-elaboration of detail, and areas of neglect revealed the debilitating effects of the recognition disorder. Moreover, an examination of the patient's strategies revealed numerous compensatory verbal and motor procedures which guided his drawing. Acknowledgments.

12757903,Spatial and temporal processing in a subject with cortical blindness following occipital surgery.,"Trevethan, Ceri T; Sahraie, Arash",Trevethan,"Blindsight subjects are typically better at discriminating rapid, transient visual events than those with gradual on/off-sets. Surprisingly, the detailed investigation of temporal characteristics of mechanisms mediating blindsight is only reported in one subject (GY). It is of interest to establish whether these characteristics are similar to those in other cases of blindsight. Here, we report on a systematic study of spatio-temporal properties of mechanisms mediating blindsight in a subject VN. VN has a lower right quadranopia following surgical removal of the left occipital cortex above the calcarine sulcus, therefore, there are no remaining islands of intact visual cortex within this area. Similar to GY, the blindsight mechanisms in VN have narrowly tuned band-pass temporal characteristics with a peak sensitivity at 20Hz and above chance performance at temporal frequencies >/=10 and </=33Hz. The spatial channel in VN has low-pass characteristics with an upper cut-off <3.5c/ degrees. There is extensive spatial summation in the blindfield whereas no temporal summation was found in the time range tested (50-1600ms). In agreement with our previous reports, pupillary responses can predict the existence of residual vision within the field defect and show similar spatial characteristics to those obtained psychophysically. The spatio-temporal characteristics of blindsight in VN reported here are similar to those reported in subjects with ischaemic lesions, suggesting that such visual capacities need not necessarily be attributed to spared areas of visual cortex.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00049-6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Fewer studies have investigated the role of the parietal lobe in auditory spatial processing, and an extensive comparison of visual and auditory spatial processing in humans with parietal lobe lesions has yet to be conducted. We have studied such localization abilities in a Balint's syndrome patient (RM) who has bilateral parietal lobe lesions. The results indicated that this patient had a significant deficit in both visual and auditory localization relative to age-matched controls. Unlike the controls, however, RM's auditory localization ability either matched or exceeded his visual localization ability depending on the task. Accordingly, RM exhibited ""auditory capture,"" but not ""visual capture"" under conditions where control subjects showed the opposite pattern. These results are consistent with hypotheses that the parietal lobes are involved in creating multiple spatial representations and in shifting from one spatial reference point to another, but suggest that these parietal structures are not necessary for the integration of multiple sensory stimuli resulting in capture effects.",{},,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/089892900562354,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

We provide a detailed case report of a patient with the Riddoch phenomenon, MC. MC has extensive bilateral lesions to occipitotemporal cortex that include most early visual cortex and complete blindness in visual field perimetry testing with static targets. Nevertheless, she shows a remarkably robust preserved ability to perceive motion, enabling her to navigate through cluttered environments and perform actions like catching moving balls. Comparisons of MC's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to a probabilistic atlas based on controls reveals that MC's lesions encompass the posterior, lateral, and ventral early visual cortex bilaterally (V1, V2, V3A/B, LO1/2, TO1/2, hV4 and VO1 in both hemispheres) as well as more extensive damage to right parietal (inferior parietal lobule) and left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VO1, PHC1/2). She shows some sparing of anterior occipital cortex, which may account for her ability to see moving targets beyond ~15 degrees eccentricity during perimetry. Most strikingly, functional and structural MRI revealed robust and reliable spared functionality of the middle temporal motion complex (MT+) bilaterally. Moreover, consistent with her preserved ability to discriminate motion direction in psychophysical testing, MC also shows direction-selective adaptation in MT+. A variety of tests did not enable us to discern whether input to MT+ was driven by her spared anterior occipital cortex or subcortical inputs. Nevertheless, MC shows rich motion perception despite profoundly impaired static and form vision, combined with clear preservation of activation in MT+, thus supporting the role of MT+ in the Riddoch phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.05.008,PMC6991136,Blindsight; FMRI; Middle temporal area (MT+); Motion perception; Riddoch phenomenon; Vision,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

After most of its manifestations had cleared, both patients exhibited severe disorders of spatial orientation: acoustic ataxia, inability to localize objects in space. In addition, 1 patient showed a topographical disorientation and abnormalities of whole body movements. This patient came to post-mortem examination, which revealed bilateral and fairly symmetrical old and recent infarctions of the superior parietal lobules. In the light of these observations and previous reports, it is suggested that the reported abnormalities of whole body movements can be explained on the basis of a visuo-motor intrahemispheric disconnection due to the bilateral lesion of the dorsal parietal lobe. In addition, the global spatial disorientation is analysed and is thought to be the manifestation of a derangement of a specific function centered in the parietal lobe. Moreover, it is pointed out that topographic disorientation does not require the concomitant failure of oculomotor mechanisms for its production. The topography of the anatomical lesion is considered in relation to current concepts on brain damage after severe hypotension and cardiac arrest.

We applied convergent methodologies to study his dorsal stream processing, using psychophysics as well as structural and functional imaging. Using standard perimetry we found deficits involving the periphery of the left inferior quadrant abutting the horizontal meridian, suggesting damage of dorsal retinotopic representations beyond V1. Retinotopic damage was much more extensive when probed with frequency-doubling based contrast sensitivity measurements, which isolate processing within the magnocellular pathway: sensitivity losses now encroached on the visual central representation and did not respect the horizontal meridian, suggesting further damage to dorsal stream retinotopic areas that contain full hemi-field representations, such as human V3A or V6. Functional imaging revealed normal responses of human MT+ to motion contrast. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a recent proposal of two distinct magnocellular dorsal stream pathways: a latero-dorsal pathway passing to MT+ and concerned with the processing of coherent motion, and a medio-dorsal pathway that routes information from V3A to the human homologue of V6. Anatomical evidence was consistent with sparing of the latero-dorsal pathway in our patient, and was corroborated by his normal performance in speed, direction discrimination and motion coherence tasks with 2D and 3D objects. His pattern of dysfunction suggests damage only to the medio-dorsal pathway, an inference that is consistent with structural imaging data, which revealed a lesion encompassing the right parieto-occipital sulcus.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.05.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

To assess whether S.C.'s reaching accuracy was affected by the position of the target with respect to the retina, eyes, and/or head, he was asked to perform a pointing task in different conditions. By manipulating eyes and head position, the relative location of the target with respect to these body parts was altered. Further, to verify the relevance of the visual feedback for the accuracy of the reaching responses, the task was also performed either with or without vision of the performing hand (closed- and open-loop conditions). The results showed that the patient's reaching impairment reflects a deficit in spatio-motor coding mainly within head-centred coordinates. The lack of visual feedback about the hand spatial location worsened the reaching performance.

The alexic patient performs well with Moiré patterns but neither with (complex) texture elements nor with textures.

A schema is an iconic representation where perceptual detail has been abstracted away from reality in order to provide a more flexible structure for cognition. Unlike truly symbolic representations of spatial relations (i.e., prepositions) a schema preserves some analog spatial qualities of the relation it stands in for. We tested the efficacy of schemas in facilitating the perception and comprehension of spatial relations in a patient with bilateral occipitoparietal damage and resulting simultanagnosia. Patient E.E. performed six matching tasks involving WORDS (in, on, above, below), photographic PICTURES of objects, and/or SCHEMAS depicting the same spatial relations. E.E. was instructed to match a single spatial relation to a corresponding image from an array of four choices. On the two tasks that did not include matching to or from schemas, E.E. performed at chance levels. On tasks with schemas, performance was significantly better, indicating that schematic representations make spatial relations visible in a manner that symbols and complex images do not. The results provide general insight as to how schemas facilitate spatial reasoning when used in graphic depictions, and how such theoretically intermediate representational structures could serve to link perceptual and verbal representations of spatial relations in the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2013.03.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Tests of verbal and visual spatial processing were presented, and multiple choice performances were obtained using both left and right hands. A double dissociation emerged, with superior left-handed performance on visual spatial tasks, and better right-handed performance on verbal tasks. In addition, the patient displayed hemispatial dyscalculia in which he solved written arithmetic problems disregarding free-field numerical information presented toward his left. Evidence of multimodality left-sided extinction was also present. Further, despite unilateral callosal apraxia, the left hand displayed superiority during a continuous performance task. These results demonstrate that specialized functions of the cerebral hemispheres may be observed for response output in the absence of restricted hemispheric input, and that components of the neglect syndrome may be seen following corpus callosotomy.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/0028-3932(89)90005-5,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng
18206962,A hand in blindsight: hand placement near target improves size perception in the blind visual field.,"Brown, Liana E; Kroliczak, Greg; Demonet, Jean-François; Goodale, Melvyn A",Brown,"Bimodal visual-tactile neurons respond to visual and/or tactile stimuli presented near the hands, arms, and face. The strength of bimodal-cell response to a visual stimulus depends on its proximity to the hand. We tested the hypothesis that hand proximity to a visual stimulus would influence unconscious residual vision in the blind field. MB is a 26-year-old man with a dense upper-left quadrantanopia following surgical treatment that severed Meyer's loop, and SB is a 35-year-old man with a dense left hemianopia following childhood meningitis. Testing for ""hand-assisted"" blindsight in MB allowed us to evaluate whether phenomena related to hand proximity are dependent on information relayed through the optic radiations. We presented target objects of different sizes to the blind fields of these gentlemen, and asked them to estimate target size with their right hand by adjusting thumb-finger distance or reaching and grasping the object. Concurrently, we varied the location of the resting left hand. In the hand-far condition, the left hand rested on their lap, and in the hand-near condition, it was placed just to the left of the target object. In the hand-far condition, both patients showed no scaling of either size-estimation aperture (SEA) or peak grip aperture (PGA) to object size. In the hand-near condition, however, both PGA and SEA were scaled to object size. Additional studies of MB suggest that hand proximity effects cannot be attributed solely to changes in spatial attention. These results imply that if bimodal cells are recruited when the hand is placed nearby the visual target, they must receive information from cortical areas that do not depend on the integrity of the optic radiations.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.10.006,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

J.P.'s preserved ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences rules out a syntactic deficit as the primary cause of the role confusions. Thematic role assignment is also required with spatial prepositions such as in or above, and J.P.'s thematic role assignment was also severely impaired with spatial prepositions. We capitalized on prior linguistic analyses and behavioural studies to design accurate tests of the semantics of spatial terms, spatial relations, and critical features of objects. Fine-grain semantic tests revealed that the semantics of spatial terms and objects was intact. We hypothesize that J.P.'s role confusions reflected a failure to integrate objects within semantic representations that define the thematic roles. Our data suggest that properties of objects and thematic roles are specified by distinct semantic processes, which have different brain localizations. J.P.'s lesion further suggests that left inferior frontal regions are critical in thematic role assignment, thus contributing to the understanding of the linguistic functions of these regions.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290802365151,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",England,eng

Experiment 2 confirms that the lateral and radial accuracy obtained in the latter (square) task cannot be predicted from the lateral and radial displacements found in horizontal and vertical (radial) line bisection; the experiment also shows that the individual horizontal lines of a square can be bisected significantly more accurately than the same lines presented individually. Experiment 3 shows that the crucial figural component requisite for the accurate estimation of lateral extent is a large vertical (radial) line in right space.

Thalamic lesions have been associated with spatial neglect, but whether asymmetric attention specific to near or far space occur after thalamic damage has not been explored. It is also unclear if thalamic injury can induce contralesional defective response inhibition. We tested a woman with a left thalamic infarction who reported that, when driving, she had a tendency to veer towards people or objects on the right side of the road. Our patient and four controls performed a line bisection task with a laser pointer in near and far extrapersonal space. The experimenter marked each bisection either from the right of the presented line (right-distractor, RD) or the left (left-distractor, LD). RD and LD trials were pseudo-randomized. Our patient performed similarly to controls (mean -0.7 mm, controls -0.6 mm) on the line bisection task in near space. In far space she erred significantly rightward compared to her performance in near space (p<0.001). Controls performed similarly in near and far space. The experimenter position did not affect our patient's performance on near line bisections, nor did controls demonstrate a distractor effect for the near condition.

Controls also demonstrated a distractor effect in the far condition (LD -6.4 mm, RD 0.7 mm, p<0.01), though of much smaller magnitude.

JD reached accurately, without vision, to a final target after actively reaching to a landmark, but exhibited severely impaired reaching after passive movements to the landmark.

Rather than performing randomly, our patient used a temporal or spatial strategy in assigning thematic roles. Because he also had a production-mapping deficit and used the same temporal-spatial strategy in production tasks, we hypothesize that the mapping of thematic roles onto grammatical categories and vice versa may be a specific aspect of sentence processing that is common to sentential production and comprehension.

Though partial spontaneous recovery occurred in some cases, the precise cause(s) of this condition remained obscure for almost a century. Here, we describe a unique patient (EH) with a large right-sided occipito-parietal hemorrhage showing a complete loss of visual depth perception for several months post-stroke. EH could well simultaneously describe multiple visual objects - hence did not show simultanagnosia - but at the same time was completely unable to estimate their distance from him. In every 3-D visual scene objects appeared equidistant to him, thus experiencing a total loss of depth perception (""flat vision""). Neurovisual assessments revealed normal functions of the eyes. EH showed bilateral lower field loss and a severely impaired binocular convergent fusion, but preserved stereopsis. Perceptual re-training of binocular fusion resulted in a progressive and finally complete recovery of objective binocular fusion values and subjective binocular depth perception in a far-to-near-space, gradient-like manner. In parallel, visual depth estimation of relative distances improved, whereas stereopsis remained unchanged. Our results show that a complete loss of 3-D depth perception can result from an isolated impairment in binocular fusion. On a neuroanatomical level, this connection could be explained by a selective lesion of area V6/V6A in the medial occipito-parietal cortex that has been associated with the integration of visual space coordinates and sustained eye-positions into a cyclopean visual 3-D percept.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.01.029,,Binocular vision; Depth perception; Fusion; Parietal lobe; Stereopsis; V6/V6A,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Planning demands were manipulated across conditions by providing additional spatial information to constrain the drawing. Both patients produced drawings that were less accurate than controls. In addition, ECR was particularly poor at producing oblique lines compared to both RA and controls, even under conditions with minimal planning demands. This pattern of performance is qualitatively similar to that of children under eight years (see Broderick and Laszlo, 1988). Taken together these results provide further evidence that constructional apraxia is not a unitary disorder (with differential performance between patients) and that those differences are not necessarily related to laterality of damage (as both patients had right-hemisphere lesions).

In audition, multiple simultaneous sounds are most effectively perceived if they are distributed along the frequency dimension. Thus, attention to spectro-temporal features alone can allow detection of a target sound amongst multiple simultaneous distracter sounds, regardless of whether these sounds are spatially separated. Spatial bias in attention associated with neglect should not affect auditory search based on spectro-temporal features of a sound target. We report that a right brain damaged patient with neglect demonstrated a significant gradient favouring the ipsilesional side on a visual search task as well as an auditory search task in which the target was a frequency modulated tone amongst steady distractor tones. No such asymmetry was apparent in the auditory search performance of a control patient with a right hemisphere lesion but no neglect.

21254790,Rapid improvement of chronic stroke deficits after perispinal etanercept: three consecutive cases.,"Tobinick, Edward",Tobinick,"Thrombolytic therapy reduces stroke size and disability by reperfusion and salvage of ischaemic penumbra. Emerging evidence suggests that retrieved penumbra may be the site of ongoing inflammatory pathology that includes extensive microglial activation. Microglial activation may be associated with excessive levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and resultant neurotoxicity. Etanercept, a potent biologic TNF antagonist, reduces microglial activation in experimental models and has been therapeutically effective in models of brain and neuronal injury. Perispinal administration of etanercept, previously reported to be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, may facilitate delivery of etanercept into the brain. The objective of this report is to document the initial clinical response to perispinal etanercept in the first chronic stroke cohort so treated. Three consecutive patients with stable and persistent chronic neurological deficits due to strokes that had failed to resolve despite previous treatment and rehabilitation were evaluated at an outpatient clinic. They were treated off-label with perispinal etanercept as part of the clinic's practice of medicine. All three patients had chronic hemiparesis, in addition to other stroke deficits. Their stroke distributions were right middle cerebral artery (MCA), brainstem (medulla) and left MCA. The two patients with MCA strokes had both received acute thrombolytic therapy. Each of the three patients was treated with an initial dose of perispinal etanercept 13, 35 and 36 months following their acute stroke, respectively. Significant clinical improvement following perispinal etanercept administration was observed in all patients. Onset of clinical response was evident within 10 minutes of perispinal injection in all patients. Improvements in hemiparesis, gait, hand function, hemi-sensory deficits, spatial perception, speech, cognition and behaviour were noted among the patients treated. Each patient received a second perispinal etanercept dose at 22-26 days after the first dose that was followed by additional clinical improvement. Open-label administration of perispinal etanercept resulted in rapid neurological improvement in three consecutive patients with chronic neurological dysfunction due to strokes occurring 13-36 months earlier.

Because no study has investigated the relationship between spatial neglect and closing-in in patients with focal brain damage, we assessed how spatial factors (drawing direction: left-to-right, right-to-left, radial) and attentional load (single versus dual task copying; the concurrent task was counting aloud) interacted in determining our patient's closing-in. We found that her closing-in was worst when she copied the stimulus (Luria's line) from left to right; greater attentional load significantly worsened her closing-in in the right-to-left direction. Closing-in seems to be caused by a pathologic release of motor behavior, analogous to other productive manifestations of extrapersonal neglect.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000083,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

20547387,A new selective developmental deficit: Impaired object recognition with normal face recognition.,"Germine, Laura; Cashdollar, Nathan; Düzel, Emrah; Duchaine, Bradley",Germine,"Studies of developmental deficits in face recognition, or developmental prosopagnosia, have shown that individuals who have not suffered brain damage can show face recognition impairments coupled with normal object recognition (Duchaine and Nakayama, 2005; Duchaine et al., 2006; Nunn et al., 2001). However, no developmental cases with the opposite dissociation - normal face recognition with impaired object recognition - have been reported. The existence of a case of non-face developmental visual agnosia would indicate that the development of normal face recognition mechanisms does not rely on the development of normal object recognition mechanisms. To see whether a developmental variant of non-face visual object agnosia exists, we conducted a series of web-based object and face recognition tests to screen for individuals showing object recognition memory impairments but not face recognition impairments. Through this screening process, we identified AW, an otherwise normal 19-year-old female, who was then tested in the lab on face and object recognition tests. AW's performance was impaired in within-class visual recognition memory across six different visual categories (guns, horses, scenes, tools, doors, and cars). In contrast, she scored normally on seven tests of face recognition, tests of memory for two other object categories (houses and glasses), and tests of recall memory for visual shapes. Testing confirmed that her impairment was not related to a general deficit in lower-level perception, object perception, basic-level recognition, or memory. AW's results provide the first neuropsychological evidence that recognition memory for non-face visual object categories can be selectively impaired in individuals without brain damage or other memory impairment. These results indicate that the development of recognition memory for faces does not depend on intact object recognition memory and provide further evidence for category-specific dissociations in visual recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.04.009,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Here, we present results from neuropsychological fMRI that refute such models. We report two patients, one with lesions to intermediate ventral regions and the other with damage around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The patient with ventral damage showed normal behavioral and BOLD responses to global Glass patterns. The patient with IPS damage was impaired in discriminating global patterns and showed a lack of significant responses to these patterns in intermediate visual regions spared by the lesion. However, this patient did show BOLD activity to translational patterns, where local element relations are important. These results suggest that activation of intermediate ventral regions is not necessary to code global patterns; instead global patterns are coded in a heterarchical fashion. High-level regions of dorsal cortex are necessary to generate global pattern coding in intermediate ventral regions; in contrast, local integration processes are not sufficient.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn_a_00489,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Nevertheless, GL produced a relative left overextension (underestimation) when trying to set the endpoints of a virtual line given its midpoint (Endpoints Task).

These symptoms typically occur with personal or extrapersonal neglect and extinction of left-sided stimuli, suggesting that all these different symptoms may be linked to the same neural substrate. In the present research, we tested two right brain-damaged (RBD) patients to find out whether changing the position of the hands in space influences tactile extinction and denial of ownership to the same extent. Results showed that manipulation of the spatial position of the hands reduces tactile extinction but leaves denial of ownership of the left hand unaffected. Such a dissociation suggests that delusional misperceptions may be independent from somatic neglect and that representation of hands in space and attribution of ownership are dynamically mapped in at least partly separate neural substrates.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490894020,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In keeping with the evidence, pathological rightward deviations in the bisection of number intervals due to right brain damage are generally interpreted as originating from a purely spatial-attentional deficit in the processing of the left side of number intervals. However, consistent double dissociations between defective processing of the left side of physical and mental number space have called into question the universality of this interpretation. Recent evidence suggests a link between rightward deviations in number space and defective memory for both spatial and non-spatial sequences of items. Here we describe the case of a left brain-damaged patient exhibiting right-sided neglect for extrapersonal and representational space, and left-sided neglect on the mental number line. Accurate neuropsychological examination revealed that the apparent left-sided neglect in the bisection of number intervals had a purely non-spatial origin and was based on mnemonic difficulties for the initial items of verbal sequences presented visually at an identical spatial position. These findings show that effective position-based verbal working memory might be crucial for numerical tasks that are usually considered to involve purely spatial representation of numerical magnitudes.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.05.005,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In the experiment, AE's latencies to name the colour of two cubes, each located in one hemispace, were measured. In some conditions, the cubes were placed on a table but in other conditions each cube was held in one hand of an experimenter who could either face the patient or show the cubes while her back was turned towards him. One prediction was that AE would show longer latencies for cubes in left hemispace; however, if object-centred neglect also occurred, then latencies should be even longer for cubes held in the experimenter's left hand. In order to reveal the presence of neglect for 'far' versus 'near' space, the cubes could also be positioned either near to (i.e. reaching distance) or far from the patient (i.e., several metres out of reach), by moving the table or the experimenter. Finally, in some conditions, AE looked at the cubes into a mirror that was positioned far away from his body. Because external objects seen in a mirror can be 'near' the patient's body, the patient actually looked at a 'far' location (i.e. the surface of the mirror) to see an object that is 'near'. The experiment confirmed the presence of all forms of neglect, since AE not only named the colour of a cube seen in his left hemispace more slowly than in right hemispace, but latencies increased for a cube held by the experimenter in her left hand and in left hemispace (both when the left hand was seen directly or as a mirror reflection). Finally, AE's performance was worse for 'far' than 'near' locations, when the cubes were physically located near his body (i.e., within ""grasping"" space) but seen in the mirror.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70020-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Nonetheless, the hippocampus may be specialized for allocentric topographical processing, which impacts on short-term memory or even perception. To investigate this we developed performance-matched tests of perception (match-to-sample) and short-term memory (2 s delayed-match-to-sample) for the topography and for the nonspatial aspects of visual scenes. Four patients with focal hippocampal damage and one with more extensive damage, including right parahippocampal gyrus, were tested. All five patients showed impaired topographical memory and spared nonspatial processing in both memory and perception. Topographical perception was profoundly impaired in the patient with parahippocampal damage, mildly impaired in two of the hippocampal cases, and clearly preserved in the other two hippocampal cases (including one with dense amnesia). Our results suggest that the hippocampus supports allocentric topographical processing that is indispensable when appropriately tested after even very short delays, while the presence of the sample scene can allow successful topographical perception without it, possibly via a less flexible parahippocampal representation.",{},,Hippocampus,10.1002/hipo.20240,PMC2677717,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Stimuli were briefly shown in either right, left, or both fields during event-related fMRI. On bilateral trials, either a fearful or neutral left face appeared with a right house, and it could either be extinguished from awareness or perceived. Seen faces in left visual field (LVF) activated primary visual cortex in the damaged right-hemisphere and bilateral fusiform gyri. Extinguished left faces increased activity in striate and extrastriate cortex, compared with right houses only. Critically, fearful faces activated the left amygdala and extrastriate cortex both when seen and when extinguished; as well as bilateral orbitofrontal and intact right superior parietal areas. Comparison of perceived versus extinguished faces revealed no difference in amygdala for fearful faces. Conscious perception increased activity in fusiform, parietal and prefrontal areas of the left-hemisphere, irrespective of emotional expression; while a differential emotional response to fearful faces occurring specifically with awareness was found in bilateral parietal, temporal, and frontal areas.

The right premotor frontal cortex is commonly assumed to play a secondary role in this system. We describe a patient who developed left upper limb apraxia after a right premotor ischaemic stroke. The neuropsychological examination ruled out impairment of other cognitive functions, including those subserved by the parietal-temporal cortex. Neither pyramidal signs nor interhemispheric transfer syndrome were detected, suggesting that the right primary motor cortex and corpus callosum were intact and that apraxia arose from a right prefrontal cortical lesion. An additional feature was the patient's inability to copy a gesture or posture demonstrated by the examiner (visual input) or to execute a verbal command (auditory input), even though he could copy the position in which the examiner placed his right arm while blindfolded (proprioceptive input). The disturbance was interpreted as ""dissociation apraxia"". To our knowledge this type of dissociation has never been reported in a patient with focal brain damage.

We tested the impact of prism therapy on visual awareness for the left side of chimeric objects as well as chimeric faces, in three neglect patients.

We propose that in BC, the cognitive impairment is in failing to represent the direction of tilt for line orientations. Our results suggest that there exists a level of representation in the human brain at which line orientations are represented compositionally, such that the direction of a line orientation's tilt from a vertical mental reference meridian is coded independently of the magnitude of its angular displacement. Reflection errors across a vertical axis were observed both in visual and tactile line orientation tasks, demonstrating that these errors arise at a supra-modal level of representation not restricted to vision, or, alternatively, that visual-like representations are being constructed from the tactile input.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2007.06.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

The lesion was localized in the peripheral visual association cortex, Brodmann area (BA) 19, adjacent to BA 37, both of which are part of the occipitotemporal visual pathway. Additional psychophysical measurements revealed an elevated threshold for perceiving coherent motion, which we relate to a partial loss of function in V5, a region adjacent to the cavernoma.

This constitutes a double-dissociation considered by current neurocognitive thinking as compelling evidence for separate networks. However, a similar double-dissociation exists with respect to perceived as opposed to imagined space. If the organization of represented space was similar to that of perceived space, it should contain a far/near dissociation as well. This paper describes a patient with pure representational neglect restricted to far space.",{},,Neurology,10.1212/01.wnl.0000068028.63291.b6,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng
16393753,Effects of emotional face cueing on line bisection in neglect: a single case study.,"Tamietto, Marco; Latini Corazzini, Luca; Pia, Lorenzo; Zettin, Marina; Gionco, Maurizio; Geminiani, Giuliano",Tamietto,One patient with left neglect (FM) and four right brain-damaged controls were tested on a line bisection task with pictures of neutral and emotional faces as unilateral cues. We thus manipulated the attentional salience of the cues (higher for emotional and lower for neutral faces) while keeping constant their physical dimensions. Our findings showed that left emotional faces were more effective than left neutral faces in reducing bisection errors only in FM. These data indicate that in the neglected hemispace cues bias attention rather than simply altering the perceptual point of balance of the line in the horizontal plane.,{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790500259717,,,"Case Reports; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
12599151,[Topographic disorientation associated with infarction in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery].,"Martínez-Fernández, E; Gil-Néciga, E; Boza-García, F; Montes, E; Donaire, A",Martínez-Fernández,"Topographic disorientation is defined as the difficulty to find one s way in familiar surroundings. It can be due to an amnesic or agnostic like defect, which is known as topographic amnesia or agnosia. This disorder can give rise to disability in the life of the patient and may well go undetected unless a suitable neuropsychological study is conducted. We report the cases of two patients with infarction in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery who began with hemianopsia and topographic disorientation. One of the cases was due to a disorder affecting spatial memory and the other was caused by errors in visuospatial perception. The battery of tests for studying visuospatial perception VOSP was administered. Occipital lesions are often associated with topographic disorientation, especially when it is the right hemisphere that is injured. It is important to detect this alteration, which makes the patient totally dependent on others even in his or her own home. The appearance of an amnesic or agnostic type disorientation can be related with a disorder affecting one of the two systems that play a part in the processing of visual data. A guided neuropsychological study can provide us with a great deal of information about the type of disorder presented by the patient.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

The normal performance of this patient with unquestionable orbitofrontal and dorsolateral atrophy probably reflects a limitation of the WCST and HCT rather than true capacity on her part to perform the cognitive operations of set formation, maintenance, and categorization.",{},,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,10.1080/01688638608401321,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
3196486,Electrodermal discrimination of familiar but not unfamiliar faces in prosopagnosia.,"Bauer, R M; Verfaellie, M",Bauer,"It has been previously shown that prosopagnosics can electrodermally ""recognize"" faces they cannot verbally identify and with which they feel no familiarity. This study extended previous results by showing that electrodermal discrimination of faces exists only on a famous face identification task, and not on a matching-to-sample task involving unfamiliar faces. This suggests that electrodermal recognition reflects the activation of stored identity-specific information built up on the basis of past contact with faces, and provides a psychophysiological distinction between familiar and unfamiliar face processing. Implications for cognitive models of face recognition, and for understanding the nature of prosopagnosia, are discussed.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/0278-2626(88)90052-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng
20090342,Heading disorientation: a new test and a possible underlying mechanism.,"Hashimoto, Ritsuo; Tanaka, Yasufumi; Nakano, Imaharu",Hashimoto,"Heading disorientation (HD) is a type of pure topographical disorientation. Reported cases showing HD have been very few so far, and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study is to find the anatomic substrates of HD and to demonstrate a possible underlying mechanism for the symptom. We investigated 3 patients with HD by a new test, the card-placing test (CPT). Part A of the test assesses the ability of a subject to retain information on spatial locations of cards placed on the floor around the subject. Part B examines the subject's ability to integrate information on the spatial locations of similarly arranged cards and that on changes of the body directions. The patients had a lesion that commonly involved the right retrosplenial cortex and showed good record results for part A but very poor ones for part B. The results of the CPT suggest that HD patients cannot integrate information on the spatial locations of objects derived from an egocentric reference frame with that on changes of the body directions. The retrosplenial cortex may be the place where these different types of information necessary for navigation converge.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,European neurology,10.1159/000276398,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
12633587,Developmental prosopagnosia: a study of three patients.,"Barton, Jason J S; Cherkasova, Mariya V; Press, Daniel Z; Intriligator, James M; O'Connor, Margaret",Barton,"We studied perception in three patients with prosopagnosia of childhood onset. All had trouble with other 'within-category' judgments. All were deficient on face matching tests and severely impaired on tests of perception of the spatial relations of facial features and abstract designs, indicating a deficit in the encoding of coordinate relationships, similar to adult-onset prosopagnosia with lesions of the fusiform face area. Two had difficulty perceiving feature colour, which correlated with reduced luminance sensitivity. In contrast to adult-onset patients, saturation discrimination was spared in two and spatial resolution impaired in two. Curvature discrimination was relatively spared. Contrast sensitivity showed variable reductions at different spatial frequencies. We conclude that developmental prosopagnosia is similar to the adult-onset form in encoding deficits for the spatial arrangement of facial elements. Deficits in luminance perception and spatial resolution are more associated with defective encoding for basic object-level recognition, as shown on tests of object and spatial perception.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1016/s0278-2626(02)00516-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
1382919,Tactile agnosia and tactile aphasia: symptomatological and anatomical differences.,"Endo, K; Miyasaka, M; Makishita, H; Yanagisawa, N; Sugishita, M",Endo,"Two patients with tactile naming disorders are reported. Case 1 (right hand tactile agnosia due to bilateral cerebral infarction) differentiated tactile qualities of objects normally, but could neither name nor categorize the objects. Case 2 (bilateral tactile aphasia after operation of an epidural left parietal haematoma) had as severe a tactile naming disturbance as Case 1, but could categorize objects normally, demonstrating that tactile recognition was preserved. Case 1 may be the first case of tactile agnosia clearly differentiated from tactile aphasia. CT scans of Case 1 revealed lesions in the left angular gyrus, and in the right parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Case 2 had lesions in the left angular gyrus and of posterior callosal radiations. Our findings suggest that tactile agnosia appears when the somatosensory association cortex is disconnected by a subcortical lesion of the angular gyrus from the semantic memory store located in the inferior temporal lobe, while tactile aphasia represents a tactual-verbal disconnection.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80154-2,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng
15488908,Reduced endogenous control in alien hand syndrome: evidence from naturalistic action.,"Giovannetti, Tania; Buxbaum, Laurel J; Biran, Iftah; Chatterjee, Anjan",Giovannetti,"Patients with alien hand (AH) syndrome from medial frontal lesions exhibit involuntary but seemingly purposeful contralesional upper limb movements. Two observations about AH patients have received little, if any, experimental confirmation. The first is that AH is triggered opportunistically by nearby objects. The second is that AH behaviors are increased in conditions of fatigue or anxiety, i.e. under reduced attentional control. A prominent account explains AH as reduced intention-driven (endogenous) executive control. This account predicts that erroneous AH behaviors should be driven by environmental (i.e. exogenous) factors, such as distractor proximity to the hand. AH errors should be less influenced by the intention or action plan (i.e. endogenous factors), such as the semantic relatedness of distractors to targets. Moreover, due to capacity limitations of the endogenous controller, AH behaviors should increase under conditions of secondary task load. We tested these predictions with an AH patient in two experiments using a naturalistic coffee-making task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the affected hand was highly perseverative and strongly influenced by exogenous but not endogenous factors. The non-alien hand made fewer errors. Experiment 2 showed that there was a disproportionate increase in perseverations and exogenous errors of the affected hand under secondary task load. The non-alien hand was significantly less disrupted by dual task conditions. These data provide experimental support for previous anecdotal observations about AH behavior in naturalistic settings, and are consistent with a unilateral defect in endogenous control.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.06.017,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng
