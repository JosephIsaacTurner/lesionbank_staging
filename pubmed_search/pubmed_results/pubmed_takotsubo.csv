33556594,Takotsubo Syndrome in Neurologic Disease.,"Baker, Cordell; Muse, John; Taussky, Philipp",Baker,"Transient cardiac dysfunction, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a well-known complication among patients presenting with neurologic insult, who are described as having takotsubo syndrome. This condition is commonly associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage but has also been described in patients after cerebral surgery or in those with ischemic stroke, seizure, and traumatic brain injury. Current evidence suggests that cardiac dysfunction in these patients is a result of increases in catecholamines that are induced by supraphysiologic levels of sympathetic activity. The cardiac injury is typically reversible and carries a good prognosis, but secondary complications may arise if the diagnosis is not recognized early.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2021.01.139,,Neurogenic stunned myocardium; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy; Takotsubo syndrome; Transient cardiac dysfunction,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

SAHs are primarily traumatic, while a minority of cases are spontaneous. The majority of spontaneous SAHs occur due to the rupture of a cerebrovascular aneurysm. A small number of spontaneous SAHs occur without any objective findings of an aneurysm. Most of these cases are in older patients with certain risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and alcohol use. This article reports a young female patient without any known significant risk factors who developed an acute spontaneous SAH while experiencing a significant psychological stressor. Recent literature has focused on certain somatic manifestations of psychological stressors, such as stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy. We postulate that our patient's SAH was a sequela of psychological stress and that the pathophysiology may be similar to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.27124,PMC9392856,iatrogenic subarachnoid hemorrhage; internal medicine; psychological stress; sah; spontaneous intra-cranial hemorrhage; spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage; stress; stress-related cardiomyopathy; subarachnoid hemmorhage; takosubo cardiomyopathy,Case Reports,United States,eng

34603185,Case Report: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy After Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Wang, Fajun; Darby, Joseph",Wang,"<b>Introduction:</b> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) or ""stress cardiomyopathy"" is an uncommon condition characterized by transient cardiac dysfunction with left ventricular apical ballooning in an appropriate clinical context. TCM has been observed in a variety of acute neurological conditions most prominently in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and status epilepticus. TCM has only been reported infrequently in association with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Herein we present a patient who developed TCM 3 days after hospital admission with severe TBI. <b>Case Presentation:</b> A 30-year-old male presented to the hospital with an acute subdural hematoma, anisocoria, declining consciousness and CT evidence of uncal herniation after being found down in a hotel room. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for decompressive hemicraniectomy and hematoma evacuation. On the post-trauma day (PTD) 3, the patient developed acute dyspnea with increased oxygen requirements that improved with diuresis. On PTD 4, nursing staff noted T waive inversions (TWI) on the bedside monitor prompting an electrocardiogram (ECG) that showed a prolonged QTc interval and worsening TWI in leads I, II, aVL, and V2-6. Troponin I level was mildly elevated at 0.63ng/mL. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was subsequently performed and showed a low ejection fraction (EF 26%) with apical hypokinesis and basal hyperkinesis, consistent with TCM. A diagnosis of TCM was confirmed by Cardiology consultation and he was started on a beta-blocker and an ACE inhibitor. Follow-up TTE on PTD 20 showed a normal left ventricular EF. <b>Conclusion:</b> While rarely reported in patients with TBI, TCM developed in an otherwise healthy young male following severe TBI necessitating decompressive hemicraniectomy. TTE should be considered in patients with TBI who have cardio-pulmonary symptoms or unexplained ECG abnormalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2021.727754,PMC8479872,TBI; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy; case report; diagnosis; stress cardiomyopathy; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

TS is generally reported after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured aneurysm, and has an incidence rate of 0.8 (17%). Here, we report a rare case of TS with unruptured intracranial aneurism. A 54-year-old woman had a history of systemic arterial hypertension and migraine. She went to a secondary hospital 2 h after sudden-onset chest pain, which irradiated to the left upper limb and back. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal but showed a troponin curve, which led us to suspect acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Serial ECG showed dynamic changes in ST-segment elevation in DIII, AvF, V5, and V6. Emergency cardiac catheterisation was performed and did not show any obstructive lesions. However, ventriculography revealed hypokinesia of the inferoapical wall. During hospitalization, the patient had a severe refractory headache. Computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography were performed, which identified ""mirror"" saccular aneurysms. A supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm was embolized with two stents. The patient's condition progressed satisfactorily. The association between takotsubo syndrome and aneurysmal SAH with some populations has already been reported. Due to this prior knowledge, and severe headache, it was necessary to perform screening for SAH and the discovery of an unruptured aneurysm in this case report. The present case report differs from most reported cases of takotsubo syndrome described in the literature because it presents unruptured mirror aneurysms, while most cases are diagnosed after intracranial hemorrhage.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Clinical case reports,10.1002/ccr3.7998,PMC10547853,brain aneurysm; neurogenic stress; stunned neurogenic myocardium; takotsubo syndrome,Case Reports,England,eng

We herein report a rare case of Takotsubo syndrome associated with autoimmune limbic encephalitis. A 68-year-old Japanese woman presented to our emergency room with disturbed consciousness. At admission, she showed hypoxemia. Left ventriculography showed akinesia in the middle part of the left ventricle and hyperkinesia in the apical and basal parts of the left ventricle, and the diagnosis of midventricular Takotsubo syndrome was established. However, after an improvement in disturbed consciousness and Takotsubo syndrome symptoms, her brother noticed something wrong with her behavior during his visit to the hospital. Subsequently, we consulted the neurology department 1 week after admission. Her brother revealed a history of abnormal behavior by the patient (such as mistaken entry in the wrong apartment in her building or in another person's car) a few days prior to the onset of disturbed consciousness, suggesting disorientation of place. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an increased signal in the medial aspect of the temporal lobes, which was most clearly observed on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence; additionally, a cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis. Finally, we established a diagnosis of midventricular Takotsubo syndrome associated with autoimmune limbic encephalitis. It is presumed that the dysfunction of limbic system due to autonomic limbic encephalopathy is associated with exaggerated sympathetic stimulation. This likely resulted in Takotsubo syndrome in our patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC cardiovascular disorders,10.1186/s12872-020-01789-3,PMC7879610,Autoimmune limbic encephalitis; Case report; Limbic system; Stress cardiomyopathy; Takotsubo syndrome,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",England,eng

32348999,Left Ventricular Thrombi and Embolic Events in Takotsubo Syndrome despite Therapeutic Anticoagulation.,"Stöllberger, Claudia; Finsterer, Josef; Schneider, Birke",Stöllberger,"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) may be complicated by left-ventricular (LV) thrombus formation in 1.3-5.3% of patients. Risk factors for thrombi comprise apical TTS, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and troponine, thrombocytosis, persisting ST segment elevation and right-ventricular involvement. Embolic risk appears high, and anticoagulation is recommended. We present 3 females, aged 60-82 years, with TTS-associated LV thrombi and cerebral embolism despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Two patients showed apical and 1 patient midventricular ballooning. In 2 patients LV thrombi had not been present at the first echocardiographic examination. LV thrombi were multiple and highly mobile in 2 patients; 1 patient had a single immobile thrombus associated with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (SEC). In each case, 3 of the described risk factors for LV thrombus formation were identified. The embolic stroke occurred 41-120 h after TTS symptom onset and 21-93 h after the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. Two patients were discharged with a neurological deficit, and 1 of them eventually died as a consequence of the stroke. LV thrombectomy to prevent embolism, which has been reported in a small number of cases, had not been considered in our patients. At present, the management of patients with TTS-related thrombi is still unclear, and further studies are urgently needed to assess the best methods for imaging and anticoagulation and to determine the role of thrombolysis and cardiac surgery. Until these studies are available, we suggest the following approach: patients with a TTS-related thrombus should be monitored by echocardiography while receiving anticoagulation. In case of highly mobile LV thrombi, the heart team may consider cardiac surgery to prevent systemic embolism. The role of SEC in TTS remains to be determined.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cardiology,10.1159/000506925,,Anticoagulation; Apical ballooning; Embolic stroke; Takotsubo syndrome; Thrombus,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a cause of cardiac dysfunction after stroke, including SAH. It is characterised by transiently depressed contractile function of the left mid and apical ventricle, without obstructive coronary artery disease. Clinicians should suspect takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage who have an ECG abnormality.

Epileptic seizures as triggering events for TTS are uncommon, having only been described in approximately 100 previous cases Case report: A 64-year-old woman with a history of recent stroke-related seizures was admitted for an acute onset of right hemiparesis with dull response. Neurological examination revealed a forced deviation of the eyeballs to the left side and quadriplegia. No large intracranial artery occlusion was disclosed through computed tomography angiography, but an acute infarction at the right corona radiata was identified through magnetic resonance imaging. Electroencephalography showed frequent spike-and-wave complexes over the right cerebral hemisphere indicating subtle status epilepticus. Her consciousness deteriorated to a stuporous state, and her eyeballs were forced deviated to the right side with persistent twitching of the right limbs 10 hours later. The convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) subsided after intravenous infusion of midazolam. However, atrial flutter with inverted T-wave and elevated high-sensitivity troponin I were observed 12 hours after CSE. Arrhythmia was soon alleviated through appropriate treatment. A further coronary angiography did not show significant coronary artery stenosis but indicated that the midsection and the apex of the left ventricle ballooned out during systole as the base contracted normally, indicating a Takotsubo syndrome.

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched electronically from their inception until November 2022. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports was used to critically appraise included studies. Studies written in English describing at least one patient with SHS were included. Altogether, 26 case reports or series describing 39 patients with SHS were included. All included studies were rated of acceptable quality. Associated conditions were heterogeneous, with intracranial hemorrhagic complications being the most common (9 patients), followed by pneumothorax (6 patients) or severe pneumonia (4 patients), bowel ischemia or obstruction (6 patients), and autonomic dysfunction (3 patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and 3 patients with spinal injury, cocaine overuse, and stellate gangliectomy). Two patients had multiple complications and 12 other patients suffered from sepsis, myocardial infarction, etc. Clinical outcomes were reported for 32 patients, of whom 19 (59%) died during hospitalization (6 patients with pneumothorax or pneumonia, 4 patients with intracranial hemorrhagic complications, 2 patients with bowel ischemia or obstruction, and 7 patients due to other reasons). SHS may be associated with poor prognosis, necessitating its prompt recognition by clinicians and swift evaluation for underlying causes.

This is a retrospective review of patients transplanted at a single center between 2017 and 2019. Here we report 2 cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy that developed after liver transplantation. A 65-year-old woman diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis underwent a brain-dead donor liver transplant. The postoperative course was complicated by stroke, pulmonary hypertension, and a left internal jugular thrombus. Six months following transplant, the patient developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy with congestive hepatopathy and died of heart failure complications despite maximal medical care. The second case was a 65-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis admitted for a living donor liver transplant. The postoperative period involved recurrent seizures and elevated troponins with markedly reduced ejection fraction, which were appropriately managed. The patient recovered well with supportive care and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility shortly after. We present a series of patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy after liver transplantation. The diagnosis depends on the clinical presentation and findings on electrocardiography, echocardiography, and cardiac enzymes.

Computed tomography and angiography of the brain was normal, and the headache resolved with analgesia. Urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates (attributed to morphine administered in ED) and amphetamines. Three hours later he had a seizure and within 10 min developed cardiogenic shock with antero-inferior ST segment depression on electrocardiogram and troponin-T rise to 126 ng/L. Coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated severely impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function with ejection fraction 15-20% and hypokinesis sparing the apex. Thyrotoxicosis, nutritional, vasculitic, autoimmune and viral screens were negative. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated severe LV functional impairment with dilated and hypocontractile basal segments, and T2 hyperintensity consistent with myocardial oedema and rTC. He received supportive management. Proposed mechanisms of rTC include catecholamine cardiotoxicity and coronary artery vasospasm. In this case, multiple insults including severe headache, cannabis hyperemesis and cocaine and methamphetamine-induced serotonin toxicity culminated in a drug-induced seizure which led to catecholamine cardiotoxicity resulting in rTC.

Coronary angiogram showed no signs of coronary atherosclerosis. Upon further neurological evaluation, a diagnosis of MS relapse, related to TTS, was made, and treatment was started accordingly. The patient was discharged after 12 days after the admission, free of symptoms, and without signs of neurological and cardiological active disease. A hallmark of TTS is its association with a preceding stressful event. It may also be connected to a wide variety of diseases, including neurological ones, such as stroke, intracranial bleeding, head trauma, migraine, and seizures. However, up to our knowledge, only few cases of MS-induced TTS were previously described. Whether it is plausible to consider TTS as an uncommon extra-neurological manifestation of MS is still debated, however all the evidence points in that direction, considering the central role of catecholamines in TTS pathogenesis.

We report a 82-years old female with a history of long-standing untreated arterial hypertension who was hospitalized because of a left-sided tongue paralysis and dysarthria. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed ischemic lesions in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery affecting the capsula interna and gyrus praecentralis. The carotid and cerebral arteries showed extensive atherosclerotic wall irregularities, a high-grade stenosis of the M1-segment of the right middle cerebral artery and a 60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery at its origin. Elevated creatine-kinase and Pro-brain-natriuretic peptide levels and development of new ischemic signs in the electrocardiogram suggested myocardial infarction, although the patient did not complain about cardiac symptoms. Echocardiography showed apical ballooning which resolved during the following days. The patient refused coronary angiography why the diagnosis of TTS was not completely established. However, normalization of echocardiogram and ECG were indicative for TTS. TTS has to be considered in stroke patients, irrespective of their etiology. Since patients often do not report typical symptoms or may even be asymptomatic, TTS can be overlooked. If the ECG in stroke patients shows signs of myocardial ischemia, troponin and BNP levels should be measured whose ratio may even help to differentiate between TTS and myocardial infarction.

While SAH-related deaths usually occur as a result of brain impairment due to hemorrhage, permanent neurological deficits are caused by cerebral ischemia due to edema and spasm of cerebral arteries. Additionally, ~20%-30% of patients with SAH develop secondary cardiomyopathy; this phenomenon is known as neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy (NSC), which is associated with increased mortality and poor long-term prognosis. Levosimendan is a new inotropic drug that causes calcium sensitization of troponin C, thus increasing contraction force of myofilaments. The drug also causes opening of ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscles, which results in dilatation of veins and arteries, including cerebral arteries. To date, there have been several reports of levosimendan application in patients with SAH and neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy, and the effect of the drug on vasospasm has been previously advocated.

A 41-year-old white woman with a history of autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis diagnosed 3 years earlier and acute adrenal insufficiency diagnosed 3 weeks earlier presented with new onset of heart failure New York Heart Association class IV, which had started shortly after initiation of hormone replacement therapy with hydrocortisone 20 mg/day and fludrocortisone 0.3 mg/day. Nine days before admission she had collapsed because of dizziness and had a cerebral concussion and open fracture of her nasal bone, however, no further investigations were carried out at that time. A physical examination revealed leg edema, tachycardia, tachypnea, bilateral basal crepitations, and blood pressure 110/70 mmHg. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, low voltage, negative T-waves in V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> and a corrected QT interval of 590 ms. Echocardiography revealed a reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 30 %, and septal, apical, and anterior wall akinesia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed relative enhancement of gadolinium, indicating hyperemia and capillary leakage, and no myocardial scars. Because of the improvement in her cardiac function, lack of cardiovascular risk factors, and lack of signs for ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging, no coronary angiography was carried out. The results of sellar and renal magnetic resonance imaging were normal. Her troponin T was slightly elevated. Bisoprolol and ramipril were started. Her fludrocortisone dose was reduced to 0.05 mg/day. Her electrocardiogram and systolic function, documented by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, normalized within 6 months. Although we could not exclude coronary artery disease by coronary angiography, her clinical course and instrumental findings suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy of the apical type. Fludrocortisone overdosage and increased myocardial vulnerability due to cortisol deficiency might be pathogenetic factors, whereas myocarditis is unlikely. When hormone replacement in patients with Addison's disease is initiated, cardiac function should be monitored by electrocardiogram and echocardiography.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-016-1074-5,PMC5059987,Addison’s disease; Case report; Hashimoto thyroiditis; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There are several cardiac manifestations of TA and an association with Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) - but not coronary vasospasm - has been previously reported. The role of emotional stress in this context is unknown. A 58-year-old Caucasian female elementary school teacher, with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), severe asymptomatic aortic regurgitation (AR), and TA in remission under corticosteroids, was admitted in the emergency department with worsening chest pain and dyspnea, initiated after a period of intense emotional stress (increased workload during COVID-19 pandemic). Physical examination revealed signs of heart failure (HF) with hemodynamic stability and an early diastolic heart murmur. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, T wave inversion in left precordial and lateral leads, and a corrected QT of 487 ms. Laboratorial evaluation presented high values of high-sensitivity troponin I (3494 ng/L) and B-type natriuretic peptide (4759 pg/mL). The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe dilation of left ventricle (LV) with moderate systolic dysfunction, due to apical and midventricular akinesia, and severe AR. The coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. An acetylcholine provocative test induced spasm of both the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, accompanied by chest pain and ST depression, completely reverted after intracoronary nitrates administration. The patient was switched to diltiazem and a drug multitherapy for HF was started. A cardiac magnetic resonance revealed severe dilation of the LV, mild apical hypokinesia, improvement of ejection fraction to 53%, signs of myocardial edema and increased extracellular volume in apical and mid-ventricular anterior and anterolateral walls, and absence of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement, compatible with TTS. At discharge, the patient was clinically stable, without signs of HF, and a progressive reduction of troponin and BNP levels was observed. A final diagnosis of TTS and coronary vasospasm in a patient with GAD and TA was done. We present the first case of acute HF showing coexistence of TA, TTS and coronary vasospasm. TA is a rare inflammatory disease that can be associated with TTS and coronary vasospasm. Besides that, coronary vasospasm may also be involved in TTS pathophysiology, suggesting a complex interplay between these diseases. Mood disorders and anxiety influence the response to stress, through a gain of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an increased cardiovascular system sensitivity to catecholamines. Therefore, although the mechanisms behind these three pathologies are not yet fully studied, this case supports the role of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases in TTS and coronary vasospasm.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.882870,PMC9108163,Takayasu's arteritis; Takotsubo syndrome; case report; catecholamines; coronary vasospasm; emotional stress; myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA),Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

37206102,Cardiogenic shock due to reverse takotsubo syndrome triggered by multiple sclerosis brainstem lesions: a case report and mini review.,"Brandner, Joas; Lu, Henri; Muller, Olivier; Eskioglou, Elissavet; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Antiochos, Panagiotis; Chocron, Yaniv",Brandner,"Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is mainly characterized by chest pain, left ventricular dysfunction, ST-segment deviation on electrocardiogram (ECG) and elevated troponins in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Diagnostic features include left ventricular systolic dysfunction shown on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with wall motion abnormalities, generally with the typical ""apical ballooning"" pattern. In very rare cases, it involves a reverse form which is characterized by basal and mid-ventricular severe hypokinesia or akinesia, and sparing of the apex. TTS is known to be triggered by emotional or physical stressors. Recently, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been described as a potential trigger of TTS, especially when lesions are located in the brainstem. We herein report the case of a 26-year-old woman who developed cardiogenic shock due to reverse TTS in the setting of MS. After being admitted for suspected MS, the patient presented with rapidly deteriorating clinical condition, with acute pulmonary oedema and hemodynamic collapse, requiring mechanical ventilation and aminergic support. TTE found a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, consistent with reverse TTS (basal and mid ventricular akinesia, apical hyperkinesia). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 4 days later showed myocardial oedema in the mid and basal segments on T2-weighted imaging, with partial recovery of LVEF (46%), confirmed the diagnosis of TTS. In the meantime, the suspicion of MS was also confirmed, based on cerebral MRI and cerebral spinal fluid analyses, with a final diagnosis of reverse TTS induced by MS. High-dose intravenous corticotherapy was initiated. Subsequent evolution was marked by rapid clinical improvement, as well as normalization of LVEF and segmental wall-motion abnormalities. Our case is an example of the brain-heart relationship: it shows how neurologic inflammatory diseases can trigger a cardiogenic shock due to TTS, with potentially serious outcomes. It sheds light on the reverse form, which, although rare, has already been described in the setting of acute neurologic disorders. Only a handful of case reports have highlighted MS as a trigger of reverse TTS. Finally, through an updated systematic review, we highlight the unique features of patients with reversed TTS triggered by MS.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,10.3389/fcvm.2023.1175644,PMC10188972,brainstem lesions; cardiogenic shock; inverted takotsubo; multiple-sclerosis; reverse takotsubo; takotsubo; takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy; takotsubo syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This condition is triggered by multiple emotional or physical stressors, while neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy after brain injuries has become increasingly recognized in children over the past few years. We report the case of an 11-year-old child with an atypical clinical presentation after a serious car crash accident. An initial computed tomography scan revealed an acute epidural hematoma, which was immediately treated by an emergency craniotomy. During the patient's following pediatric intensive care unit hospitalization, severe hemodynamic instability was observed, leading to gradually higher doses of vasopressors for circulatory support. On echocardiography, the patient had signs of severe cardiac contractility compromise, with characteristic pattern of regional wall motion abnormalities of the left ventricle, which, in combination with seriously elevated cardiac enzymes, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and continuous thermodilution hemodynamic monitoring (PICCO) findings, led to intensification of inotropic support and to the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite supportive measures, the patient developed multiorgan failure and succumbed to their serious illness. For this atypical case, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was addressed as an option for the seriously failing heart, but due to the extremely high risk of intracranial bleeding, it could not be used for this patient's treatment. In conclusion, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be suspected in pediatric cases of cardiac dysfunction after serious injuries or stress conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Pediatric reports,10.3390/pediatric15030036,PMC10366713,epidural hematoma; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This case study describes the development of TCM after an ischemic stroke and establishes a possible association between the region of stroke and the development of TCM. We present the case of a 75-year-old woman who suffered a stroke of the left insular part (M2) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and echocardiogram findings concerning for TCM within 24 hours. TCM should be recognized as a potential risk in the initial hours following a cerebral ischemic stroke, particularly when the insular region is affected.

A variety of noncardiac conditions had been known to mimic the ECG changes that are seen in acute coronary syndrome. Although the common ECG changes that are documented with raised intracranial pressure are T inversions, prolongation of QT interval and sinus bradycardia, ST elevation or depression, arrhythmias and prominent U waves have also been recognized. However, ST elevations in association with primary intracranial tumours are rarely reported. A 68-year-old female patient with a large left sided frontoparietal sphenoidal ridge meningioma with mass effect developed sudden onset shortness of breath while awaiting surgery. Her ECG showed ST segment elevations in the inferior leads along with reciprocal T inversions in anterior leads. The patient was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and unfractionated heparin. The ST elevations in the ECG remained static and the cardiac Troponin assay was repeatedly negative. 2D ECHO, coronary angiogram and CT pulmonary angiography were normal. The repeat noncontract CT scan of the brain revealed two small areas of haemorrhage in the tumour. The two mechanisms for ECG changes described in subarachnoid haemorrhage are the neurogenic stunned myocardium due to the catecholamine surge on the myocytes and stress cardiomyopathy. The same mechanisms could be the reasons for the ECG changes seen in intracranial tumours. These ECG changes could be easily misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome. This case emphasizes the importance of the cardiac biomarkers, 2D ECHO and coronary angiogram when confronted with such a diagnostic dilemma. Thus a more holistic analysis should be practiced in diagnosing acute coronary events in patients with intracranial pathologies to obviate a myriad of unnecessary investigations, interventions, costly treatment strategies which may well be detrimental to the patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,BMC cardiovascular disorders,10.1186/s12872-017-0525-2,PMC5379702,ECG changes; Inferior ST segment elevated myocardial infarction; Intracranial tumour,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

31653824,Diffuse Deep T-Wave Inversions Following a Generalized Seizure.,"Prosperi-Porta, Graeme; Oleynick, Christopher",Prosperi-Porta,"BACKGROUND Stress cardiomyopathy (SCM) is a transient dysfunction of the left ventricle due to physical or emotional triggers that produces a range of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. While ST-segment elevation or depression often leads to more urgent investigation and diagnosis, T-wave inversions can result in delayed diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 44-year-old woman with a prior left middle cerebral artery septic embolic stroke from endocarditis resulting in residual dense right sided hemiparesis and aphasia was admitted to the hospital for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. While hospitalized, she experienced a generalized seizure that was aborted with lorazepam and then loaded with phenytoin. Her ECG following the seizure showed a prolonged QT interval, for which her methadone that she was stabilized on during hospitalization was held. Her ECG to follow-up on her QT interval 25 h following the seizure showed new diffuse symmetric deep T-wave inversions. While initially believed to be due to the either the discontinuation of methadone or initiation of phenytoin, retrospective analysis revealed that these changes were more suggestive of a missed SCM. CONCLUSIONS We report a patient who experienced a generalized seizure resulting in diffuse, symmetric, deep T-wave inversions that were incorrectly attributed to medication effects before identifying the likely diagnosis of SCM. Fortunately for this patient, there were no consequences of the delayed diagnosis, but this case emphasises the importance of considering SCM following a generalized seizure in any patient with ECG abnormalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.918566,PMC6826335,,Case Reports,United States,eng

Neurocardiogenic injury from acute neurologic events such as intracranial bleeding can precipitate transient left ventricular dysfunction (termed 'neurogenic stunned myocardium') that may be indistinguishable from takotsubo cardiomyopathy. There is controversy about the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of acute neurologic disorders. We describe a case of a 67-year-old female who initially presented with takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to an acute gastrointestinal illness and 4 years later developed a recurrence in the setting of an ischemic cerebrovascular accident that was associated with more prominent EKG changes and much higher cardiac biomarker release but similar degree of left ventricular dysfunction. This case suggests that susceptibility to this disorder is likely due to patient-specific factors rather than etiology, and acute neurologic disorders should be included as precipitants of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We also theorize that there may be patients with milder forms of stress-related cardiac injury who do not develop left ventricular dysfunction, being similar to the wide range of cardiac manifestations in patients with acute neurologic disorders. We review published literature on neurologic precipitants of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Cardiology,10.1159/000328464,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is frequently triggered by emotional or physical stress and occurs primarily in post-menopausal women. The pathomechanism of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is, so far, unknown. Stress-induced amnesia is probably induced by perturbation of the hippocampal function. Assault-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with amnesia has not been reported so far. In a 77-year-old Caucasian female, hospitalized because of confusion, anterograde amnesia, and hypertension after she had been assaulted by a female who sneaked up to her when she was unlocking the door of her apartment, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed based on clinical findings, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and coronary angiography. Follow-up after 8 weeks showed a regression of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; the amnesia for the assault, however, remained unchanged. This case shows that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be triggered by emotional stress induced during an assault.

Possible mechanisms of this disorder include epicardial catecholamine cardiotoxicity. Therefore, generally, cardiac function is worst at the early stage of SAH, when sympathetic activity is highest, and recovers thereafter. Dobutamine infusion seems to have triggered the takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the present patient even 9 days after onset of SAH.

We describe an unusual case of repeated subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH)in a 64-year-old woman with a history of PAN. Initially, she developed severe headache(probable first SAH, day 0), and presented at our hospital with second severe headache with disturbed consciousness on day 6. Computed tomography(CT)revealed that SAH was mainly distributed in the right basal cistern and sylvian fissure(second SAH). Three aneurysms were detected using CT angiography on the bilateral internal carotid arteries. An intentionally delayed surgery was planned because of the high risk period of cerebral vasospasm and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. On day 15, she complained of headache and had a convulsion. CT revealed a third SAH in the left sylvian fissure;cerebral angiography revealed enlargement of the left internal carotid-posterior communicating artery(IC-PC)aneurysm. Coil embolization of the aneurysm was performed on day 16, and she was treated using prednisolone(20mg/day)for PAN. However, on day 20, the patient became comatose, and CT revealed a fourth SAH in the right sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiography revealed enlargement of the right IC-PC aneurysm. Clipping of the aneurysm was successfully performed in spite of ventricular dysfunction, and the dose of prednisolone was increased to 40mg/day. After treatment, the ventricular dysfunction gradually resolved. Cerebral aneurysms with PAN are candidates for intervention because of their strong tendency to rupture. In our case, takotsubo cardiomyopathy might have been associated with impairment of the coronary microcirculation due to PAN.

TTS is also known as stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning, reversible acute heart failure, neurogenic stunned myocardium or acute catecholamine cardiomyopathy. This case report describes an uncommon presentation of myocardial stunning after an anesthetic procedure. A 14-year-old girl with a history of pineal cyst and hemiplegic migraine was admitted for control brain magnetic resonance imaging. During anesthesia induction with propofol she suffered bradycardia, which was reversed with atropine, followed by tachyarrhythmia, reversed with lidocaine and precordial thump. Within hours she developed pulmonary edema and global respiratory failure due to acute left ventricular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesia and depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <30%). The electrocardiogram showed persistent sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated (troponin 2.42 ng/ml, proBNP 8248 pg/ml). She was placed on diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and dopamine. The clinical course was satisfactory with clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic improvement within four days. Subsequent echocardiograms showed no ventricular dysfunction. The patient was discharged home on carvedilol, which was discontinued after normalization of cardiac function on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Few cases of TTS have been described in children, some of them triggered by acute central nervous system disorders and others not fulfilling all the classical diagnostic criteria. In this case the anesthetic procedure probably triggered the TTS.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,10.1016/j.repc.2015.09.003,,Idade pediátrica; Miocárdio atordoado; Pediatric population; Stunned myocardium; Síndrome Takotsubo; Takotsubo syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,Portugal,eng; por

The affection of the heart muscle often leads to transient global or regional systolic dysfunction of left ventricle or both ventricles and increased occurences of malignant arrhytmias. On the contrary, stress-induced cardiomyopathy is described as temporary segmental loss of contractility, mostly in apical segments of the left ventricle with mid- and basal sparing and less common hypokinesias in mid- or basal parts, or affection of both ventricles. This case report is dedicated to a 34-years old male, who was admitted to the department of emergency medicine after suicide attempt by carbon monoxide poisoning. Echocardiography at admission showed akinesias of midsegments of left ventricle and severe hypokinesias of apical and basal segments. Despite severe cardiogenic shock, adequate therapeutic management including mechanical ventilation, normobaric oxygenotherapy and catecholamine treatment led to a complete somatic recovery after 2 weeks, and without any permanent hypoxemic brain injury. Our case might be a coincidence of toxic cardiomyopathy, caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a result of long term exposition to combined stress factors that may lead even to a suicide attempt. Both types of cardiomyopathies often occure simultaneously due to similar pathophysiologic mechanisms. Both tako-tsubo and toxic cardiomypathy have good prognosis after overcoming the acute phase.

It is triggered by stress and is frequent following bouts of epileptic seizures. We report the case of a patient who began with this cardiomyopathy following epileptic seizures suffered after one of her haemodialysis sessions. We report the case of a 55-year-old female on haemodialysis due to chronic renal failure, with epilepsy secondary to a residual lesion in the right frontoparietal area due to a haematoma that required surgical evacuation. After her haemodialysis session she suffered an attack of focal epilepsy with secondary generalisation and, some hours later, pain in the middle of her chest. Serial enzymes revealed increased levels of troponin I and, electrocardiographically, negative T waves were observed in precordial derivations (V2-V6). Coronary catheterisation was performed, with normal results, and alterations were noted in contractility, which were confirmed as being transient in a serial echocardiography study. All the previous data lead us to a suspected diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome. Cardiac complications are one of the causes of morbidity and mortality in epilepsy, and Takotsubo syndrome is an example of them. The real incidence of this syndrome is unknown, but given its involvement in mortality caused by heart problems in epilepsy it is important to suspect it in the presence of cardiac dysfunction following epileptic seizures.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa
