24229653,What are the causes of late-life depression?,"Aziz, Rehan; Steffens, David C",Aziz,"Although depression in old age is less common than depression in younger populations, it still affects more than 1 million community-living older adults. Depression in late life has been associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality from both suicide and illness. Its causes are multifactorial but are prominently related to both biologic and social factors. Psychological factors, although less studied in elders, are also important in understanding its cause. In this article, multiple facets of late-life depression are reviewed, including its clinical presentation, epidemiology, and biopsychosocial causes.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,The Psychiatric clinics of North America,10.1016/j.psc.2013.08.001,PMC4084923,Depression; Geriatric; Late life; Psychological; Social factors in late life,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review",United States,eng
16542786,Rapid recovery from major depression using magnesium treatment.,"Eby, George A; Eby, Karen L",Eby,"Major depression is a mood disorder characterized by a sense of inadequacy, despondency, decreased activity, pessimism, anhedonia and sadness where these symptoms severely disrupt and adversely affect the person's life, sometimes to such an extent that suicide is attempted or results. Antidepressant drugs are not always effective and some have been accused of causing an increased number of suicides particularly in young people. Magnesium deficiency is well known to produce neuropathologies. Only 16% of the magnesium found in whole wheat remains in refined flour, and magnesium has been removed from most drinking water supplies, setting a stage for human magnesium deficiency. Magnesium ions regulate calcium ion flow in neuronal calcium channels, helping to regulate neuronal nitric oxide production. In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. Magnesium treatment is hypothesized to be effective in treating major depression resulting from intraneuronal magnesium deficits. These magnesium ion neuronal deficits may be induced by stress hormones, excessive dietary calcium as well as dietary deficiencies of magnesium. Case histories are presented showing rapid recovery (less than 7 days) from major depression using 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate and taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime. Magnesium was found usually effective for treatment of depression in general use. Related and accompanying mental illnesses in these case histories including traumatic brain injury, headache, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, postpartum depression, cocaine, alcohol and tobacco abuse, hypersensitivity to calcium, short-term memory loss and IQ loss were also benefited. Dietary deficiencies of magnesium, coupled with excess calcium and stress may cause many cases of other related symptoms including agitation, anxiety, irritability, confusion, asthenia, sleeplessness, headache, delirium, hallucinations and hyperexcitability, with each of these having been previously documented. The possibility that magnesium deficiency is the cause of most major depression and related mental health problems including IQ loss and addiction is enormously important to public health and is recommended for immediate further study. Fortifying refined grain and drinking water with biologically available magnesium to pre-twentieth century levels is recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2006.01.047,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
35145781,Hypocalcemia-Induced Reversible Psychosis.,"Hall, Andrea; Bin Farooq, Talha; Alcaraz, Renato",Hall,"Hypocalcemia can manifest as a variety of presentations, ranging from neuromuscular irritability to seizures, and psychiatric manifestations such as emotional instability, anxiety, and depression. Here, we present a unique case of hypocalcemia-induced acute psychosis. A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with confusion and agitation for four to five days. The patient was noted by the family to have decreased oral intake and sleep. Auditory and visual hallucinations prompted the family to bring the patient to the ED. The patient was mildly tachycardic. Initially, the patient was agitated, impulsive, and aggressive, exhibiting psychotic features including visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, thought broadcasting, tangential and perseverative thought processes, and erotomanic delusions. She had mild leukocytosis and elevated procalcitonin on admission. A thorough workup ruled out infectious/inflammatory processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for acute meningitis/encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, and paraneoplastic etiology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal and thyroid antibodies were negative. The CT brain and MRI brain were unremarkable. The patient was severely hypocalcemic (6.7) with low parathyroid hormone (<6) on admission. To note, the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN2B). She underwent total thyroidectomy five months prior for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma complicated by postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. The patient had been non-compliant with calcium and calcitriol supplementation postoperatively. The patient was started on IV calcium gluconate and transitioned to calcitriol with calcium level improvement over the next three days. She experienced marked improvement, with the resolution of her psychosis. The patient's subacute onset psychosis with no personal or family psychiatric history and a rapid response to calcium correction supports hypocalcemia etiology. This case illustrates new-onset acute psychosis in a patient with calcium regulation imbalance. The development of hypocalcemia secondary to thyroidectomy with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism and calcium supplement non-compliance precipitated psychosis. A few similar cases have been reported, and here, we note that treatment of hypocalcemia promptly resolves symptoms. As per our review, this will be the first case of neuropsychiatric symptoms without associated cortical calcifications seen on imaging. It is important to recognize hypocalcemia as a rare cause of psychosis so as to not mistakenly categorize such presentations as primary psychotic disorders and miss a medically treatable illness.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.20874,PMC8805771,delusions; hypoparathyroidism; metabolic psychosis; reversible; s: hypocalcemia,Case Reports,United States,eng
35817494,Limbic system symptoms of rabies infection.,"Mohindra, Ritin; Madhav, Mohata; Suri, Vikas; Divyashree, Krishna",Mohindra,"Rabies is a fatal aggressive disease of the nervous system which predominantly causes motor and autonomic dysfunction. Limbic system involvement has been reported rarely, with limited data on its prevalence. The diagnosis becomes challenging when a patient presents with limbic system involvement in the absence of a clear history of an animal bite. We herein illustrate a case of a young man who presented with recurrent episodes of inappropriate ejaculation. He eventually developed hydrophobia and aerophobia, leading to a diagnosis of rabies. This case emphasises the importance of considering the possibility of rabies encephalitis when a patient presents with symptoms of limbic system involvement since early diagnosis helps in instituting appropriate public health measures and reducing exposure to infection. Furthermore, high-quality intensive care with supportive management is the mainstay of therapy in such patients until we have novel and effective antiviral drugs for rabies treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2022-249965,PMC9274529,Infection (neurology); Infection control in hospital; Vaccination/immunisation,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here, a well-studied case study of a patient with OCD and MS-compatible diagnostic findings is presented. The 42-year-old female patient had displayed OCD symptoms for 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified several periventricular and one brainstem lesion suggestive of demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses detected an increased white blood cell count, intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM synthesis, CSF-specific oligoclonal bands, and a positive MRZ reaction. Neopterin was increased, but sarcoidosis was excluded. In the absence of neurological attacks and clues for MRI-based dissemination in time, a radiologically isolated syndrome, the pre-disease stage of MS, was diagnosed. Neurotransmitter measurements of CSF detected reduced serotonin levels. In the absence of visible strategic demyelinating lesions within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, OCD symptoms may relate to reduced intrathecal serotonin levels and mild neuroinflammatory processes. Serotonin abnormalities in MS should be studied further, as they could potentially explain the association between neuroinflammation and mental illnesses.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",10.1007/s00702-023-02737-z,PMC10874305,Autoimmune; CSF; Inflammation; Multiple sclerosis; OCD; RIS,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Austria,eng
19204849,The effects of epilepsy and its treatments on affect and emotion.,"Hixson, John D; Kirsch, Heidi E",Hixson,"Epilepsy creates significant morbidity, disability, and loss of productivity worldwide. Although unpredictable seizures define epilepsy, the cognitive and emotional difficulties encountered by people with epilepsy may have an even greater impact on everyday function. Epilepsy is associated with lower quality of life (QOL); while this is partially attributable to ongoing seizures, QOL is independently affected by comorbid affective disorders like depression and anxiety. These can accompany all types of epilepsy, but may be especially noteworthy in partial epilepsy syndromes with foci in the frontal or temporal lobes. There is growing evidence that epileptogenic lesions disrupt cortical networks that carry out emotional processing. In addition to epilepsy itself, treatment strategies also affect cognitive functioning and mood. Antiepileptic drugs, vagal nerve stimulation, and surgical resection have all been associated with changes in mood, emotional processing, and social cognition. Overall, the relationship between epilepsy and emotion is vastly complex; when assessing emotional difficulties in a person with epilepsy, we must consider the psychosocial impact of the disease on the patient, the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, and the effects of ongoing treatments.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802632876,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Systemic examination revealed hypotonia, generalised reduced power and central diplopia along with peripheral visual field defect in the left eye. He was extensively investigated, the COVID-19 PCR test was negative and all routine blood tests were in the normal range except a marginally raised D-dimer of 779 ng/mL. CT head was unremarkable. He was also tested for myasthenia gravis; however, acetylcholine receptors antibodies were negative and nerve conduction studies were normal. Subsequent MRI of the brain with venography confirmed venous sinus thrombosis. A 24-hour Holter monitoring test did not reveal any cardiac rate or rhythm abnormality.

Case report and literature review. We describe the case of a 58-year-old, right-handed man developed OCD 17 months after stroke resulting from lesion of the right middle cerebral artery infarction. The patient was successfully treated with sertraline up to 50 mg per day. His OCD behaviors largely reduced in 6 weeks, and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score was reduced from 29 to 12 in 1 year. A literature review revealed 21 previous cases of OCD following CVA. Among these, consistent with our case, the basal ganglia was the most common site of the lesion responsible for the development of this rare disorder. We discuss the patient's treatment and outcomes. Our present case and a literature review suggest that OCD can manifest following CVA, although further studies are necessary.

27789118,Adverse Structural and Functional Effects of Marijuana on the Brain: Evidence Reviewed.,"Mandelbaum, David E; de la Monte, Suzanne M",Mandelbaum,"The growing use and legalization of cannabis are leading to increased exposures across all age groups, including in adolescence. The touting of its medicinal values stems from anecdotal reports related to treatment of a broad range of illnesses including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscle spasms, arthritis, obesity, cancer, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, post-traumatic stress, inflammatory bowel disease, and anxiety. However, anecdotal data and the high level of interest in this treatment must not obscure objective assessments of any potential and realized short- and long-term adverse effects of cannabis, particularly with respect to age of onset and chronicity of exposure. This critical review focuses on evidence-based research designed to assess both therapeutic benefits and harmful effects of cannabis exposure and is combined with an illustration of the neuropathologic findings in a fatal case of cannabis-induced psychosis. The literature and reported case provide strong evidence that chronic cannabis abuse causes cognitive impairment and damages the brain, particularly white matter, where cannabinoid 1 receptors abound. Contrary to popular perception, there are few objective data supporting preferential use of cannabis over conventional therapy for restoration of central nervous system structure and function in disease states such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or schizophrenia. Additional research is needed to determine if subsets of individuals with various neurological and psychiatric diseases derive therapeutic benefits from cannabis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Pediatric neurology,10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2016.09.004,PMC9954727,cannabis; epilepsy; human brain; marijuana; multiple sclerosis; psychosis; treatment; white matter,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng
37323514,Psychiatric Manifestations as the Primary Presentation of Frontal Meningioma.,"Lally, Jill; Galarneau, David",Lally,"<b>Background:</b> Although some patients with primary brain lesions remain clinically asymptomatic, others may experience a range of symptoms, including headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, changes in baseline mental function, and psychiatric manifestations. Distinguishing between a primary psychiatric illness and symptoms of a primary central nervous system tumor can be especially difficult for patients with a history of mental illness. A major challenge in effectively treating patients with brain tumors is first obtaining the diagnosis. <b>Case Report:</b> A 61-year-old female with a medical history significant for bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features, generalized anxiety, and previous psychiatric hospitalization presented to the emergency department with worsening depressive symptoms and without focal neurologic deficits. She was initially placed on a physician's emergency certificate for grave disability, with anticipated discharge to a local inpatient psychiatric facility once she was stabilized. A frontal brain lesion, concerning for a meningioma, was found on magnetic resonance imaging and she was instead transferred to a tertiary center for urgent neurosurgical consultation. Bifrontal craniotomy with neoplasm excision was performed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and continued symptom improvement was noted at the patient's 6- and 12-week postoperative visits. <b>Conclusion:</b> This patient's clinical course exemplifies the clinical ambiguity associated with brain tumors, the challenge of obtaining a timely diagnosis with nonspecific symptoms, and the importance of neuroimaging for patients presenting with atypical cognitive symptoms.

37168148,Recurrent Meningitis After a Post-Traumatic Intradiploic Arachnoid Cyst: A Case Report.,"Yangi, Kivanc; Kaynar, Mehmet Yasar",Yangi,"Intradiploic arachnoid cysts are infrequent but benign lesions of the central nervous system. Etiologically, they can be non-traumatic or post-traumatic in origin. We present an unusual case of a post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst presented with recurrent meningitis episodes. A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with fever and loss of consciousness, with a history of cranial operation due to a gunshot injury to the left occipital bone 45 years ago. On the patient's initial examination, nuchal rigidity was detected; Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were positive. A lumbar puncture has been performed, and the patient is diagnosed with meningitis. The patient had been admitted to the emergency department with rhinorrhea after a minor blunt head trauma six years ago. As we understood from the patient's medical records, a couple of millimetric non-specified pneumocephalus areas, located next to the sella turcica, were detected on the cranial non-contrast-enhanced CT scan after the minor blunt trauma to the frontal bone. However, there was no sign of any obvious skull base fracture. The patient was hospitalized for five days and discharged on the sixth day without any complaints. After the discharge, the patient was admitted to other hospitals five times in the last five years with fever and anxiety. On all her admissions, the patient was diagnosed with CSF-culture-negative meningitis and treated with different unknown antibiotics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed some irregularities and thinning at the inner table of the left occipital bone; there was an enlargement of the diploic distance of the occipital bone on the left side. MR cisternography showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulizing areas just below the thickened and irregular part of the occipital bone. CSF fistula was communicated with the left lateral ventricle. The occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle was enlarged. We performed a surgical repair in order to cover the defective areas of the occipital and mastoid bones. The retromastoid approach was used. Pedunculated muscle flaps to cover the defective bony areas are used and secured with fibrin glue. There is no evidence of recurrence during the one-year follow-up period of the patient. We present this unusual case to emphasize that if post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cysts remain untreated, severe complications, such as episodes of recurrent meningitis, may occur. Although a few cases of these cysts are reported in the literature, a case of post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst presenting with recurrent meningitis has not been reported. In patients with recurrent meningitis, when no prominent etiology is found and if there is a trauma to the related bone in the patient's history, post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.37124,PMC10166393,csf-culture negative meningitis; intradiploic arachnoid cyst; negative csf culture; post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst; recurrent meningitis,Case Reports,United States,eng
35717556,Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination.,"Ahmad, Hadia R; Timmermans, Victoria M; Dakakni, Tarek",Ahmad,"BACKGROUND Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a disorder of the central nervous system which has been associated with preceding infection as well as vaccinations. We present a case of a 61-year-old woman with ADEM after receiving her initial vaccination for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This case highlights management of this acute condition. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old woman with history of hypertension and anxiety presented with progressive generalized weakness and difficulty with communication which began a few weeks ago, shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On arrival, she was found to be encephalopathic and tachypneic, ultimately requiring emergent intubation. During her hospital course, an MRI of her brain was obtained which showed nonspecific acute versus subacute leukoencephalopathy involving the brainstem and deep white matter. Her cerebrospinal fluid showed elevated protein but was otherwise unremarkable. Further testing to rule out tick-borne illnesses, viral etiology, and multiple sclerosis were negative. Electroencephalography showed nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction but no seizures or epileptiform discharges. She was treated with 5 doses of methylprednisolone 1 g and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg over 5 days. She had marked improvement in her neurologic status after treatment. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, ADEM should be acknowledged as a rare but potential complication related to COVID-19 vaccination. A proper history and physical exam in addition to a thorough work-up are necessary for prompt recognition of this condition. Initial treatment should consist of steroids followed by IVIG versus plasmapheresis for those not responsive to steroids.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936574,PMC9218399,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 64-year-old Caucasian male presented with acute worsening of progressive neurological decline with difficulty in vision and reading. Based on history, examination, cerebrospinal fluid markers, histopathology, and magnetic resonance imaging brain at the time of presentation diagnosed the patient with PML in a setting of no immunosuppression disorder. The patient was started on Pelfilgrastim with significant systematic improvement. In our literature review, it was seen that the average age of symptom presentation was 57.5 with predominance in males. Most of the patients presented with progressive neurological deficits with symptomology ranging from mild confusion, aphasia, anxiety to sensory disturbances with numbness, hemiparesis, and hemianopsia. Out of the 21 cases, patients responded to mirtazapine and intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (IVMP). The mortality rate was close to 50% with 11 fatal cases and 10 nonfatal cases. Our case and literature review demonstrate the possibility that PML may very rarely occur in patients that are immunocompetent.

Due to its rarity, the diagnosis and treatment strategies for cerebellar liponeurocytoma remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the epidemiology, clinical features, imaging findings, pathological characteristics, different diagnoses, treatment, and prognosis of cerebellar liponeurocytoma in juveniles. A 5-year-old boy was admitted to the department of neurosurgery due to a 5-month history of headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dysphoria, as well as visual blurring associated with the peak of the headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4.9×5.4×6.2 cm mass located in the fourth ventricle and cerebellar vermis combined with hydrocephalus and periventricular edema. The mass was completely removed, and pathological examination indicated a cerebellar liponeurocytoma of the World Health Organization Grade II classification. The present study was the first to report a cerebellar liponeurocytoma with total tumor resection and adjuvant radiotherapy in a pediatric patient. Total tumor resection and postoperative radiotherapy together with close and long-term follow-up seem to be the optimal treatment strategy for juvenile patients. However, the side-effect of radiation needs to be considered.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in oncology,10.3389/fonc.2021.759581,PMC8655243,case report; cerebellar liponeurocytoma; children; diagnosis; liponeurocytoma; prognosis; treatment,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Removal of the lateral orbital wall and retraction of the orbital contents, as performed with a traditional LOA, can cause diplopia and enophthalmos and affect visual acuity. The modified LOA (mLOA) preserves the lateral orbital wall to limit this morbidity. A 58-year-old man experienced new-onset headaches and anxiety attacks that improved with anti-seizure medication. He was neurologically intact on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 2-cm right anterior temporal cavernous malformation with an associated hemosiderin ring. Electroencephalogram revealed right temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity suspicious for anterior temporal lobe epilepsy. He underwent an endoscopic-assisted keyhole mLOA for resection of the cavernoma and hemosiderin-stained brain. Key steps included a Y-shaped incision in the upper eyelid/lateral canthus, removal of a 1.5-cm segment of the lateral orbital rim, drilling of the lateral orbital wall with preservation of the medial cortex, drilling the lateral sphenoid ridge to access the anterior temporal lobe, resecting the cavernoma with endoscopic assistance for removal of all potentially epileptogenic abnormal brain, and plating the orbital rim as part of a layered closure. Postoperatively, he remained neurologically intact. He was discharged on postoperative day 4 after resolution of a cerebrospinal fluid leak with lumbar drainage. On follow-up, his anxiety attacks had completely resolved, and his incision was well-healed.

We present the case of a 31-year-old male veteran with PTSD who reported TBI before entering the military. The reported injury appeared to be mild: He was struck on the head by a baseball, losing consciousness for ∼10 seconds. Years later, he developed severe PTSD after combat exposure. He was not receiving clinical services for these issues but was encountered in the context of a research study. We conducted cognitive, autonomic, and MRI assessments to assess brain function, structure, and neurophysiology. Next, we compared amygdala volume, uncinate fasciculus diffusion, functional connectivity, facial affect recognition, and baroreceptor coherence with those of a control group of combat veterans (n = 23). Our veteran's MRI revealed a large right medial-orbital prefrontal lesion with surrounding atrophy, which the study neuroradiologist interpreted as likely caused by traumatic injury. Comparison with controls indicated disrupted structural and functional connectivity of prefrontal-limbic structures and impaired emotional, cognitive, and autonomic responses. Detection of this injury before combat would have been unlikely in a clinical context because our veteran had reported a phenomenologically mild injury, and PTSD is a simple explanation for substance abuse, sleep impairment, and psychosocial distress. However, it may be that right prefrontal-limbic disruption imparted vulnerability for the development of PTSD and exacerbated our veteran's emotional response to, and recovery from, PTSD.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000264,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe the case of a 66-year-old Japanese male patient who developed medial medullary infarction along with severe motor paralysis and intense numbness of the left arm, pain catastrophizing, and abnormal physical sensation. We further describe his recovery using a new imagery neurofeedback-based multisensory systems (iNems) training method. <i>Clinical Course and Intervention</i>. The patient underwent physical therapy for the rehabilitation of motor paralysis and numbness of the paralyzed upper limbs; in addition, we implemented iNems training using EEG activity, which aims to synchronize movement intent (motor imagery) with sensory information (feedback visual information). <i>Results</i>. Considerable improvement in motor function, pain catastrophizing, representation of the body in the brain, and abnormal physical sensations was accomplished with iNems training. Furthermore, iNems training improved the neural activity of the default mode network at rest and the sensorimotor region when the movement was intended. <i>Conclusions</i>. The newly developed iNems could prove a novel, useful tool for neurorehabilitation considering that both behavioral and neurophysiological changes were observed in our case.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059419840246,,EEG; brain machine interface; medial medullary infarction; motor imagery; neurorehabilitation,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
1435659,The postconcussion syndrome and the sequelae of mild head injury.,"Evans, R W",Evans,"The postconcussion syndrome refers to a large number of symptoms and signs that may occur alone or in combination following usually mild head injury. The most common complaints are headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, loss of consciousness and memory, and noise sensitivity. Mild head injury is a major public health concern because the annual incidence is about 150 per 100,000 population, accounting for 75% or more of all head injuries. The postconcussion syndrome has been recognized for at least the last few hundred years and has been the subject of intense controversy for more than 100 years. The Hollywood head injury myth has been an important contributor to persisting skepticism and might be countered by educational efforts and counter-examples from boxing. The organicity of the postconcussion syndrome has now become well documented. Abnormalities following mild head injury have been reported in neuropathologic, neurophysiologic, neuroimaging, and neuropsychologic studies. There are multiple sequelae of mild head injury, including headaches of multiple types, cranial nerve symptoms and signs, psychologic and somatic complaints, and cognitive impairment. Rare sequelae include hematomas, seizures, transient global amnesia, tremor, and dystonia. Neuroimaging and physiologic and psychologic testing should be used judiciously based on the problems of the particular patient rather than in a cookbook fashion. Prognostic studies clearly substantiate the existence of a postconcussion syndrome. Manifestations of the postconcussion syndrome are common, with resolution in most patients by 3 to 6 months after the injury. Persistent symptoms and cognitive deficits are present in a distinct minority of patients for additional months or years. Risk factors for persisting sequelae include age over 40 years; lower educational, intellectual, and socioeconomic level; female gender; alcohol abuse; prior head injury; and multiple trauma. Although a small minority are malingerers, frauds, or have compensation neurosis, most patients have genuine complaints. Contrary to a popular perception, most patients with litigation or compensation claims are not cured by a verdict. Treatment is individualized depending on the specific complaints of the patient. Although a variety of medication and psychologic treatments are currently available, ongoing basic and clinical research of all aspects of mild head injury are crucial to provide more efficacious treatment in the future.",{},,Neurologic clinics,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Surgical resection of the entire tumour was successful. Histological examination revealed a glioblastoma multiforme requiring additional chemoradiotherapy. Postoperatively, catatonic signs and symptoms were not detectable. A postsurgical frontal syndrome with disinhibition and logorrhoea was present and gradually normalised over the course of several weeks. Catatonia can be the presenting symptom of a temporal brain tumour, and should therefore prompt the physician to a thorough medical investigation.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2017-224017,PMC6424181,cns cancer; depressive disorder,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

MRI shows an intracranial mass, 33÷24÷30 mm in size, localized at the level of third ventricle and lateral ventricles, with irregular shape, interesting the foramen of Monroe. There are also nodular areas of calcification and a supratentorial hydrocephalus involving the lateral ventricles and the posterior part of the third ventricle.

The histopatological examination associated with specific localization of tumor and the facial angiofibromas are very suggestive for subependimar giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). We have a rare case of atypical or incomplete TSC in which the epileptic seizures and the mental retardation are absent, the intelligence is normal, but occur some psychical symptoms: anxiety, sleeplessness, and autism or behavior disturbances.

30345063,The role of cerebellar impairment in emotion processing: a case study.,"Gold, Alexandra K; Toomey, Rosemary",Gold,"Though the cerebellum's role in visuospatial and fine motor functioning has been well-established over the last several years, the role of the cerebellum in emotion has more recently been a focus of scientific inquiry. Cerebellar impairment has been associated with deficits in emotional processing and is linked to a wide range of clinical behaviors including social withdrawal, blunted emotional expression, and impulsivity. In addition, cerebellar impairments have been associated with the onset of psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder and, more recently, obsessive-compulsive disorder. We describe a 32-year-old patient who presented to our clinic for a neuropsychological evaluation with a childhood history of a cerebellar brain tumor and detail-oriented, perfectionistic tendencies. Neuropsychological assessment data revealed impairments in visuospatial processing and in fine motor skills, likely stemming from the cerebellar tumor. Clinical assessment led to a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and also suggested impairments in socio-emotional processing. Our findings lend support to recent data which has suggested the impact of cerebellar impairment on emotional processing and related domains. Unlike many previous studies, however, our report focuses on an individual who, despite having marked impairments in certain domains, demonstrates a high level of functioning. We believe that this report holds important clinical relevance for proper diagnosis of cerebellar-related impairment and for the necessity of early intervention.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cerebellum & ataxias,10.1186/s40673-018-0090-1,PMC6186118,Cerebellum; Emotion; Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,Case Reports,England,eng

Impact of clinical neuropsychology research.","Emilien, G; Waltregny, A",Emilien,"It is well established that head injury often causes brain damage leading to long term physical, cognitive and behavioural changes in the injured patients. Whereas the physical effects ranging from sensori-motor disturbances to posttraumatic epilepsy are often reported as well as cognitive sequelae, deteriorations of emotional and behavioural aspects are often neglected. Recent advances in imaging technology and clinical neuropsychology research have greatly contributed to increase our understanding of the effect of traumatic brain injury on diverse behavioural functions. After a brief review of the current status of problems facing the brain injured patients, this paper discusses the neuropsychological aspects of 3 long term brain injured patients. All 3 patients showed important behavioural and emotional distress several years after the accident. Whereas case report of patient A and C discuss the emotional and personality disturbance characterised by anxiety, depression and irritability, case report of patient C which is a case of classic frontal syndrome showed important memory impairment with emotional disturbance characterised by apathy, lack of motivation and complete indifference to his surrounding environment. Whatever the mechanisms involved, psychoaffective disturbances in the brain injured patients appear as important problems in the long term.

In the hospital, she showed mild fever, and her memory loss worsened faster than her psychiatric symptoms, unlike in schizophrenia. Follow-up MRI scans showed a diffusely enlarged right hippocampus with a 2.5 × 1.3-cm mass lesion. Electroencephalogram showed rhythmic theta activities/interictal spikes in the right frontal lobe, for which she was treated with an antiepileptic drug. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis results showed pleocytosis. Based on this, autoimmune encephalitis was diagnosed, and steroid pulse treatment and immunoglobulin treatment were performed. Positivity for LGI-1 antibody was reported and finally led to diagnosis of LGI-1 antibody encephalitis. Clinical symptoms gradually improved, and the lesion had shrunk considerably on MRI performed 6 months after immunoglobulin treatment. She reports persistent amnesia for 6 months but has returned to her daily life under follow-up observation.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Encephalitis (Seoul, Korea)",10.47936/encephalitis.2022.00080,PMC10295921,Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 autoantibody; Autoimmune limbic encephalitis; Encephalitis; Limbic encephalitis,Case Reports,Korea (South),eng

To date, very few cases have been reported in association football players. To describe the clinicopathological features of a case of CTE in an 84-year-old former football player who was clinically diagnosed as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A retrospective review of the patient's primary care and hospital medical records was performed along with a comprehensive neuropathological examination. This patient presented at age 84 with symmetrical parkinsonism and cognitive impairment that was exacerbated by prochlorperazine. His condition was rapidly progressive with recurrent falls within 1 year. Other features included headaches, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, disturbed sleep and aggression. He received a clinical diagnosis of DLB and died approximately 2 years after the onset of symptoms. A post-mortem examination revealed stage 4 CTE. While the contemporaneous onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms in the context of possible neuroleptic sensitivity is suggestive of DLB, the additional symptoms of aggressive behavior, depression and suicidality in a former football player are consistent with the neuropathological diagnosis of CTE. This case, which is notable for the late presentation, demonstrates that CTE may masquerade as other dementias and highlights the importance of seeking a history of repetitive head impacts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Movement disorders clinical practice,10.1002/mdc3.13829,PMC10525051,chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia with Lewy bodies; football; pathology; soccer,Journal Article; Case Reports,United States,eng

The path to final diagnosis was challenging. Along with reporting the case, we review the available medical literature relating to neurosarcoidosis and central diabetes insipidus in this case report. Patient is a 56-year-old female with notable history of rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, asthma, hypertension, spinal stenosis, and seizures of unknown etiology who presented to the emergency department for worsening headache for one week. She also endorsed decreased vision, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, gait abnormality, polyuria, and polydipsia over the past three months. Physical exam and neurological exam were unremarkable. Labs on presentation were notable for hypernatremia, increased serum osmolality and urine output of 5 L/day. Given her persistent headache and history of seizure, she underwent a CT head without contrast which showed a posterior suprasellar soft tissue fullness measuring 6 mm in the hypothalamic region. She then had additional imaging studies of the brain including MRI brain w/wo contrast and MRI pituitary w/wo contrast. MRI of the brain showed enlarged optic chiasm with increased T2 signal involving the proximal optic nerves and bilateral optic tracts, no brain parenchymal lesions to suggest multiple sclerosis. MRI of the pituitary w/wo contrast showed suprasellar mass arising from either the hypothalamus or less likely the chiasm which was concerning for high-grade glioma initially. Lumbar puncture was done that showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Patient underwent right supraorbital craniotomy for biopsy of the suprasellar lesion. Surgical pathology showed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation most consistent with neuro-sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was made and patient was started on high dose steroids. Although central DI can be seen as a post-op complication, in our case, based on the clinical presentation, labs and imaging, there was concern of central DI on initial presentation. Patient was started on desmopressin 50 mg twice a day which resulted in marked improvement in urine output, serum sodium, and osmolality. Although it is rare to have nervous system involvement of sarcoidosis, symptoms of central diabetes insipidus could represent the first clinical manifestations of neurosarcoidosis.

To examine the impact of amygdalohippocampotomy upon symptoms and biomarkers of post-traumatic stress disorder. Two patients with well-documented chronic post-traumatic stress disorder who subsequently developed late-onset epilepsy underwent unilateral laser amygdalohippocampotomy. Prospective clinical and neuropsychological measurements were collected in patient 1. Additional prospective measurements of symptoms and biomarkers were collected pre- and post-surgery in patient 2. After laser ablation targeting the nondominant (right) amygdala, both patients experienced not only reduced seizures, but also profoundly abated post-traumatic stress symptoms. Prospective evaluation of biomarkers in patient 2 showed robust improvements in hyperarousal symptoms, fear potentiation of the startle reflex, brain functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to fear-inducing stimuli, and emotional declarative memory. These observations support the emerging hypothesis that the right amygdala particularly perpetuates the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and suggests that focal unilateral amydalohippocampotomy can provide therapeutic benefit.",{},,Neurosurgery,10.1093/neuros/nyaa051,PMC7593359,Ablation; Amygdala; Anxiety; Epilepsy; Hippocampus; Lesion; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Resection,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Uncommonly, it can also involve the central nervous system (CNS) and may present with a range of symptoms, including personality changes, dementia, and rhombencephalitis. Prompt antibiotic treatment and careful follow-up are crucial for favorable patient outcomes and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. In this case, we describe a 46-year-old male with primary CNS-WD and discuss the symptomatic manifestations, diagnostic findings, differential diagnosis, and management. This patient initially presented with arthritic complaints and, over a five-year period, developed progressive neurocognitive symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, retrograde amnesia, personality changes, aphasia, anhedonia, dysarthria, and rapidly progressive dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed symmetric T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensities in the bilateral medial temporal lobes, hippocampi, and hypothalamus. A lumbar puncture (LP) showed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, with no autoimmune or paraneoplastic causes. Temporal lobe biopsy revealed rod-like structures, and <i>T. whipplei</i> DNA was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for WD in patients presenting with atypical symptoms with rapidly progressive dementia, as early detection and management are key to circumventing irreversible neurological damage and death.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.65385,PMC11283316,arthritis; dementia; limbic encephalitis; nervous central system; neuroimaging; tropheryma whipplei; whipple's disease,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

First-time seizure needs careful evaluation to exclude the underlying structural brain lesions. Neuroimaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan, are strongly recommended for all adult patients with first-time seizures. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department because of the first-time loss of consciousness episode. She developed bilateral jerky movements in both her upper and lower limbs. It was associated with frothy secretions from the mouth and cyanosis. The episode lasted for two minutes and terminated spontaneously. The patient was tired after gaining consciousness. The past medical history of the patient was remarkable for anxiety, depression, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She has undergone multiple cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, but she did not take any psychiatric medications. Neurological examination did not reveal any focal neurological deficit. The patient underwent a computed tomography scan to exclude any space-occupying lesion. The unenhanced scan demonstrated bilateral symmetrical calcification of the basal ganglia. No calcification was noted in the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex. Otherwise, no intracranial pathology was seen. Such findings conferred the diagnosis of Fahr disease. The patient was discharged on carbamazepine to prevent further seizure episodes. After six months of follow-up, the patient did not experience further convulsion episodes. Fahr disease is a rare disorder with a wide spectrum of manifestations. Despite its rarity, physicians should keep this condition as a possible differential diagnosis when they encounter an adult patient with a first-time seizure, particularly in a patient with a history of neuropsychiatric disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.19965,PMC8713734,case report; computed tomography; fahr disease; neuropsychiatry symptoms; seizure,Case Reports; Retracted Publication,United States,eng

The aetiology is believed to be immune-mediated, caused by tumour-induced autoimmunity launching an attack against one's own central nervous system. The patient may present with amnesia, depression, anxiety, seizures and/or personality changes. The onset of these symptoms may precede the diagnosis of malignancy by a period of up to 2 years. The malignancy may be occult and unless the syndrome is recognised, it may fail to be detected. The diagnosis of PLE is suggested by the clinical picture, MRI evidence of mesial temporal lobe abnormality and CSF abnormalities such as the presence of oligoclonal bands. It may be further supported by the presence of paraneoplastic antibodies in the serum. Immunosuppression has been tried in some cases but memory impairment is often irreversible. There are several case reports in the literature of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis but few emphasise the resulting impact that this may have on the patient's quality of life and their carers. The accompanying amnesia is often far more distressing to the carers, who are aware of the limitations of treatment of the underlying malignancy.

Surgical treatment of anxiety-related disorders is limited by our understanding of the neural circuitry responsible for emotional regulation. Limbic regions communicate with other cortical and subcortical regions to generate emotional responses and behaviors toward anxiogenic stimuli. Epilepsy involving corticolimbic regions may disrupt normal neural circuitry and present with mood disorders. Anxiety presenting in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is common; however, anxiety in patients with cingulate epilepsy is not well described. Neurosurgical cases with rare clinical presentations may provide insight into the basic functionality of the human mind and ultimately lead to improvements in surgical treatments. We present the case of a 24-year-old male with a 20-year history of nonlesional and cingulate epilepsy with an aura of anxiety and baseline anxiety. Noninvasive work-up was discordant. Intracranial evaluation using stereoelectroencephalography established the epileptogenic zone in the left anterior and mid-cingulate gyrus. Stimulation of the cingulate reproduced a sense of anxiety typical of the habitual auras. We performed laser interstitial thermal therapy of the left anterior and mid-cingulate gyrus. At 8 months following ablation, the patient reported a substantial reduction in seizure frequency and complete elimination of his baseline anxiety and anxious auras. This case highlights the role of the cingulate cortex (CC) in regulating anxiety. Ablation of the epileptic focus resolved both epilepsy-related anxiety and baseline features.a Future studies assessing the role of the CC in anxiety disorders may enable improvements in surgical treatments for anxiety disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_241_2022,PMC9062951,Cingulate epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Ictal anxiety; Laser interstitial thermal therapy; Stereo-encephalography; Stereotactic laser ablation,Case Reports,United States,eng

Its etiology is diverse, encompassing a variety of triggers, including infections and metabolic abnormalities. Uniquely, MERS may present with psychiatric symptoms, such as delirium, visual hallucinations, and catatonia, posing diagnostic challenges. The variability of these neuropsychiatric symptoms necessitates early diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to avoid prolonged antipsychotic treatment. This report details a case of MERS in a 39-year-old male. The patient initially presented with headache, sore throat, and abnormal laboratory results: leukocytosis, neutrophilia with a left shift, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and hyponatremia. On the fourth day of admission, he developed severe anxiety and restlessness, exhibited thoughts of death, and reported experiencing vivid hallucinations upon closing his eyes. MRI revealed a hyperintense lesion in the corpus callosum. A lumbar puncture showed no increase in cell count or protein. The patient showed a positive response to treatment with antibiotics and olanzapine, demonstrating rapid symptomatic improvement. A follow-up MRI on the 11th day showed complete resolution of the brain lesions. Six months later, no neurological or psychiatric sequelae were noted. The patient's clinical progression and imaging findings led to a definitive diagnosis of MERS. The early presentation of symptoms such as restlessness, hallucinations, and death ideation played a critical role in diagnosing MERS, with early MRI examination being instrumental in both diagnosis and preventing prolonged antipsychotic medication use.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,PCN reports : psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,10.1002/pcn5.191,PMC11114290,MRI; closed‐eye visual hallucination; mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS); psychosis; tonsillitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

It can lead to dire consequences, including limb paralysis, respiratory distress, and even death. After undergoing cerebral angiography, a 41-year-old male initially displayed symptoms of dizziness and blurred vision, which advanced into dysphoria and limb weakness within 3 hours. These initial symptoms diminished by the 12th hour. Yet, 18 hours following the procedure, the patient developed quadriplegia and paresthesia below the T5 level, even though his deep sensory functions persisted unaffected. The magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging scans excluded the presence of cerebrovascular ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the magnetic resonance angiography displayed arterial vasospasms in both posterior cerebral arteries and the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery. The encephalopathy symptoms faded within 12 hours, suggesting a probable contrast-induced encephalopathy diagnosis. An magnetic resonance imaging on day 4 revealed an intensified signal in the spinal cord from C1 to T1. This finding supported the diagnosis of CIS. Following treatment with mannitol, methylprednisolone, and nimodipine, the patient's contrast-induced encephalopathy symptoms resolved completely within 12 hours.

35755230,Pain Control and Anxiolysis After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Using Immersive Virtual Reality: A Case Report.,"Kardon, Adam; Murray, Robert S; Khalid, Mazhar; Colloca, Luana; Simard, J Marc; Badjatia, Neeraj; Murthi, Sarah B; Morris, Nicholas A",Kardon,"Debilitating headache persists after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Despite high prevalence, little is known regarding optimal treatment strategies for SAH-related headache. Nonpharmacologic adjunctive therapies are emerging as tools to help treat pain and limit opioid exposure in the hospital. Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive audiovisual experience that has been shown to reduce pain perception in other patient populations. The role of VR in acute brain injury is unknown. Here we report a patient with SAH who suffered from persistent headache during her hospitalization despite escalation of analgesic pharmacotherapy. A trial of VR was used as an adjunct to medication over four days. The patient reported subjective improvement in pain and anxiety. VR may provide additional analgesia and anxiolysis over pharmacologic measures alone and warrants further study in patients with acute brain injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The Neurohospitalist,10.1177/19418744221099412,PMC9214923,headache; pain management; subarachnoid hemorrhage; virtual reality,Case Reports,United States,eng
26232437,Onyx extrusion through the scalp after embolization of dural arteriovenous fistula.,"Singla, Amit; Fargen, Kyle Michael; Hoh, Brian",Singla,"A man in his sixties referred with symptoms of episodic left lip numbness and left arm weakness was diagnosed with a Borden type 3 dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) on DSA. Successful Onyx embolization of the DAVF was performed via the distal left occipital artery using an ev3 Apollo detachable tip microcatheter. He underwent surgical obliteration for the residual DAVF 3 days later. Three months later during a routine postoperative clinic visit, the patient produced a plastic bag containing multiple small pieces of Onyx cast and the detached tip of the Apollo microcatheter that had extruded out from his scalp through small spontaneous holes about 5 weeks after the embolization procedure. This spontaneous extrusion of Onyx can be alarming to the patient not expecting it; however, prior knowledge and discussion can lessen the anxiety of both the treating physician and the patient dealing with such a situation.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011879.rep,,Angiography; Complication; Embolic; Inflammation; Vascular Malformation,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our clinic with acute diplopia and headache limited to the right side. There was no specific medical history except for migraine, depression, and anxiety, all of which were controlled by oral medications. Physical examination revealed ptosis and mydriasis in the right eye, which indicated right third and sixth cranial nerve palsies. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a right parasellar lesion at the cavernous sinus wall and ophthalmic nerve. Laboratory examinations and brain computed tomography scan showed negative findings. Initial differential diagnosis included meningioma, sarcoidosis, tuberculoma, and lymphoma. However, results of further studies, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures and Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA assay, were negative. Biopsy of the cerebral lesion was performed through the subfrontal approach, and histopathologic study confirmed CST. She was treated with a standard antituberculous regimen. After 12 months of follow-up, no cerebral or clinical findings were seen. CST is a rare presentation of M. tuberculosis, and the diagnosis is a difficult challenge.

In people with stroke, it can impact as many as 23% of patients, with negative effects on mental health as well as stroke-related disability. Medically-induced PTSD may have unique features compared to other forms of PTSD, and therefore there is a pressing need to evaluate existing treatments for PTSD in this context. The current study reports on the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD subsequent to a pontine stroke. Using a quasi-experimental case design, a 44-year-old Caucasian woman received EMDR delivered via telehealth. Self-report measures were obtained at baseline, pre-EMDR, and post-EMDR, with brief neuropsychological testing pre/post-EMDR. After 3 sessions of EMDR, the patient no longer met criteria for PTSD, and showed clinically significant reductions in depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms. With proper safety provisions, it is feasible to deliver EMDR via telehealth to alleviate post-stroke PTSD. Reduced linguistic demands of EMDR may be particularly appealing for persons with neurological disorders as compared to other trauma therapies. Further work is also needed to understand the parameters of baseline neuropsychological function that could impact response to intervention.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Brain injury,10.1080/02699052.2022.2140833,,EMDR; case report; eye movement desensitization reprocessing; pons; post-traumatic stress disorder; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Anti-NMDAR antibodies are unfrequently reported in PLE associated with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Given that PLE can precede the diagnosis of cancer, it is very important that once infectious, metabolic, nutritional, or structural disorders associated with short-term memory loss are ruled out that vigorous effort must be made to rule out underlying malignancy. We report a rare case of PLE as the presenting symptom of SCLC. A 72-year-old male with history of COPD was brought to the ED by his wife after he was found to have short-term memory loss, including forgetfulness of his wedding anniversary the day before, and anxiety. Neurological exam showed impaired short-term recall on MOCA. CT head showed no evidence of infarct. Lumbar puncture was performed which showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, a nonspecific inflammatory change. CSF panel was negative for HSV, <i>Neisseria</i>, <i>Hemophilus</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and HIV.

33013635,Changes in Brain Function and Structure After Self-Administered Home Photobiomodulation Treatment in a Concussion Case.,"Chao, Linda L; Barlow, Cody; Karimpoor, Mahta; Lim, Lew",Chao,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common neurological disorder among athletes. Although there are no widely accepted treatments for TBI, new investigational approaches, such as photobiomodulation (PBM), are being tested. PBM is a light therapy that uses red to near-infrared (NIR) light to stimulate, heal, and protect tissue that has been injured or is at risk of dying. Benefits following transcranial PBM treatments in animal models of acute TBI and a small number of chronic TBI patients have been reported. However, the human PBM TBI studies published to date have been based on behavioral assessments. This report describes changes in behavioral and neuroimaging measures after 8 weeks of PBM treatments. The subject was a 23-year professional hockey player with a history of concussions, presumed to have caused his symptoms of headaches, mild anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. He treated himself at home with commercially available, low-risk PBM devices that used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit 810-nm light pulsing at 10 or 40 Hz delivered by an intranasal and four transcranial modules that targeted nodes of the default mode network (DMN) with a maximum power density of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. After 8 weeks of PBM treatments, increased brain volumes, improved functional connectivity, and increased cerebral perfusion and improvements on neuropsychological test scores were observed. Although this is a single, sport-related case with a history of concussions, these positive findings encourage replication studies that could provide further validation for this non-invasive, non-pharmacological modality as a viable treatment option for TBI.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2020.00952,PMC7509409,cognition; home treatment; neuroimaging; photobiomodulation; traumatic brain injury (TBI),Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of tension headache for 20 days and mild dysarthria. These symptoms were followed by panic, profuse sweating, severe dysarthria, dizziness, unsteady gait, and paroxysmal muscle spasms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The patient's condition steadily deteriorated. He repeatedly presented with rigidity, panic attacks, severe anxiety, paroxysmal inspiratory laryngeal stridor, cyanosis of the lips, and intractable epilepsy. Electromyography showed multiple myoclonic seizures, a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and a single generalized tonic seizure. Screening for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies revealed anti-GlyR antibodies in his cerebrospinal fluid. Immunomodulatory pulse therapy with steroids and immunoglobulin resulted in expeditious improvement of the symptoms within 2 weeks, and a follow-up at 5 weeks showed consistent clinical improvement.

Most patients use dizziness as a non-specific term, and thus suffer prejudice from the physicians' end and can be disregarded frequently. Dizziness can be a symptom of various diseases, some with sinister pathologies. We present a case of garden-variety vertigo that unfurled to be not-so-simple, emphasizing the importance of a thorough history and physical examination again even in the era of technology. A 32-year-old male patient with no past medical history presented with dizziness, later clarified as gradually progressive vertigo for two years, with unstable gait, dysarthria, and occasional diplopia. Physical examination found sustained nystagmus that changed direction with horizontal gaze, vertical nystagmus with upward gaze, dysarthria, and a wide-based ataxic gait. CT head without contrast revealed indeterminate hypodense areas in the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellar hemisphere. MRI brain identified a 2.8 x 3.4 x 4.2 cm Spetzler-Martin grade IV brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) involving the left midbrain, pons, and cerebellum. Feeders were mostly from the posterior circulation, with three intranidal aneurysms, all draining into the deep venous system. The AVM was deemed inoperable, and the patient was treated with onyx embolization for two/three feeding vessel aneurysms. After treatment, the symptoms persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) six months after diagnosis, and was admitted a year later with suicidal ideation and substance use disorder. Brain AVMs are rare clinical entities that present in 0.1% of the population, mostly presenting as intracranial bleeds. When they do rarely present with isolated focal neurologic deficits, it has been attributed to a vascular steal phenomenon, hemorrhage, or a mass effect. The isolated findings of vertigo and dysarthria are highly non-specific; with such presentation, clinicians should consider etiologies under the realm of vertigo of central origin. An untreatable AVM reduces patients' quality of life and has been linked to depression and anxiety, and thus patients may benefit from psychosocial therapy. Although preventing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary concern with brain AVMs, the rest of the patient's profile should not be forgotten.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.8870,PMC7387078,arteriovenous malformation; dizziness; nystagmus; vertigo,Case Reports,United States,eng

31447480,Syncope and Twitching at the Emergency Department.,"Scutelnic, Adrian; Prange, Ulrike; Jung, Simon; Heldner, Mirjam R",Scutelnic,"BACKGROUND Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a type of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. This case report elucidates features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis, focusing on clinical findings and outcome as well as on rarely reported sinus arrest and its pathophysiology. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old female patient presented at the Emergency Department (ED) because of twitching and an acute confusional state. Initial neurological examination revealed cognitive disturbance with disorientation, inattention, and amnestic deficits. While in the ED, twitching of the right arm was observed and shortly thereafter she experienced a sinus arrest. A temporary cardiac pacemaker was implanted. Laboratory investigations demonstrated mild hyponatremia and positive LGI1-IgG antibodies in serum. An initial head MRI was unremarkable and electroencephalography showed epileptic seizure activity starting focally in the left hemisphere synchronous with the intermittent twitching of the right arm. A seizure-suppressant therapy with levetiracetam, valproate, and gabapentin was initiated, as well as an immunosuppressive pulse therapy with methylprednisolone followed by a tapering oral regimen of prednisolone. Within a few days, the seizures ceased. One month later, neurocognitive test results were back to normal. At 2 years, mild depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were the main clinical problems, as well as episodic migraine-like headaches. CONCLUSIONS Repetitive focal dystonic seizures, confusion, amnestic deficits, sinus arrest, and mild-to-moderate hyponatremia are pathognomonic features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis. Sinus arrest may occur because of a direct pathophysiological dysfunction of the structures involved in autonomic cardiac rhythm control or as an ictal or postictal phenomenon. Early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are both of utmost importance for favorable clinical outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.916945,PMC6730258,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In the state of increased anxiety, performance on language tasks, in particular discourse production, declined relative to performance in low-anxiety settings. Even in mild aphasia, language-based anxiety can interfere with language performance. This finding provides a basis for carrying out a study with a larger sample that can open a new path to assessment and treatment of persons with aphasia.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Clinical linguistics & phonetics,10.3109/02699206.2015.1014572,,Anxiety; aphasia; discourse; linguistic tasks; stress,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

6764397,Managing acute toxicity from nonprescription stimulants.,"Sawyer, D R; Conner, C S; Rumack, B H",Sawyer,"The symptomatology and management of toxicity caused by nonprescription stimulants is reviewed. Nonprescription stimulants contain (singly or in combination) the same basic active ingredients: caffeine 100-200 mg, phenylpropanolamine 25-50 mg, and ephedrine 25 mg. Generally, toxic reactions involve excessive CNS stimulation (e.g., increased motor activity, anxiety, and agitation) and mildly elevated pulse rate and blood pressure that resolve in six to eight hours without specific treatment. However, reactions following the ingestion of these stimulants have included severe hypertension, possible renal failure, cerebral hemorrhage, and cardiac arrhythmias. Neither ephedrine nor caffeine ingested as single entities have been reported to produce increases in blood pressure associated with end-organ damage; however, severe hypertension has followed therapeutic doses of phenylpropanolamine. General management in the overdosed patient involves establishing respiration, initiating emesis, administering activated charcoal and a cathartic, and monitoring the patient's blood pressure, ECG, fluid intake, and urinary output. The increased availability of tablets and capsules containing substantial quantities of phenylpropanolamine, caffeine, and ephedrine creates a potential for drug-induced morbidity and mortality.",{},,Clinical pharmacy,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

She was diagnosed with kleptomania. She had previously been diagnosed with CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed mild atrophy of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, left hippocampus, and occipital cortex, as well as diffuse mild T<sub>2</sub> hyperintensity in the deep and subcortical white matter, including the frontal region. During a single-photon emission computed tomography scan, significant hyperperfusion was observed in the right ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, ventral thalamus, and right ventrolateral prefrontal areas. Patchy hypoperfusion was found in the bilateral posterior cingulate, parietal, and occipital regions. The patient's neurocognitive function was normal, except for slight impairment of her executive function. Her symptoms and neuroimaging findings were not suggestive of a specific neurocognitive disorder. Hyperactivity of the right ventral striatum may contribute to both obsessive-compulsive disorder and kleptomania.

The authors describe a case of recurrent delirium/mania with prominent catatonic features after a cerebellar and pontine stroke, and subsequent successful treatment with lorazepam. Symptoms quickly resolved after antipsychotics were discontinued, with continuation of valproate and lorazepam treatment. Failure to recognize this patient's syndrome as a form of catatonia could have had severe, even life-threatening, consequences.

Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. For patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. Further study of this approach seems warranted.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of neurosurgery,10.3171/2013.5.JNS13201,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The first case involves a 44-year-old Hispanic male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anxiety, and depression who presented with continuous, uncontrollable, unilateral movements 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed lesions in the basal ganglia, confirming the diagnosis of hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome. The patient was started on antipsychotic medications and antihyperglycemic medications controlling glucose levels, but continued to have hemiballismus symptoms. The second case involves a 78-year-old Haitian female with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with weakness and continuous, involuntary movements in her upper and lower extremities 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia and encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were positive for bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, establishing a diagnosis of hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome. After a 2-week stay at an acute rehabilitation center, both patients made a significant recovery in function and activities of daily living.

Interestingly, there may be racial differences in the presentation and subsequent prognostication of treatment of moyamoya. It is diagnosed with classic angiographic findings of stenosis or occlusion of the circle of Willis vessels. Here, we describe a 28-year-old Caucasian female who was initially diagnosed with anxiety when she presented with symptoms of impaired concentration and fatigue. After the development of remitting slurred speech and facial droop, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiogram yielded the discovery of high-grade stenosis of the origin of the left middle cerebral artery with associated thrombosis in that area.

In this context, neurofeedback training, i.e., a non-invasive and relatively low cost technique that contributes to neuroplasticity and behavioral performance, might be promising for stroke rehabilitation. We intended to explore neurofeedback training on a 63-year-old male patient and a 77-year-old female patient with chronic stroke. Both of them had suffered from an ischemic stroke for rather long period (more than 3 years) and could not gain further improvement by traditional therapy. The neurofeedback training was designed to enhance alpha activity by 15 sessions distributed over 2 months, for the purpose of overall cognitive improvement and hopefully also motor function improvement for the female patient. We found that the two patients showed alpha enhancement during NFT compared to eyes open baseline within most sessions. Furthermore, both patients reduced their anxiety and depression level. The male patient showed an evolution in speech pattern in terms of naming, sentences completion and verbal fluency, while the female patient improved functionality of the march. These results suggested that alpha neurofeedback training could provide a spectrum of improvements, providing new hope for chronic stroke patients who could not gain further improvements through traditional therapies.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2019.00800,PMC6668042,alpha; chronic stroke; cognition; neurofeedback; rehabilitation,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.195,,Central post-stroke pain; Intermittent stimulation; Spinal cord stimulation; Thalamic pain,Case Reports,United States,eng

This clinical research study aimed to combine data relating to neuropsychological assessments and P300 to explore cognitive dysfunction and affective impairment following brainstem stroke. Thirty-four patients with isolated brainstem stroke and twenty-six healthy controls were recruited; for each patient, we collated data pertaining to the P300, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Chinese version (MoCA), trail-making test (TMT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Digit Spans (DS), Stroop test, Self Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Significance was analyzed using an independent <i>T</i>-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test. Correlation was analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis or Spearman's correlation analysis. Collectively, data revealed that brainstem stroke caused mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and that visuospatial, attention, linguistic, and emotional disturbances may occur after isolated brainstem stroke. Cognitive decline was linked to P300 latency, ACE-III, and MoCA; P300 latency was correlated with ACE-III. Patients with right brainstem lesions were more likely to suffer memory decline. The present study provides initial data relating to the role of the brainstem in neurocognition, and will be useful for further understanding of vascular cognitive and affective impairment.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,10.3389/fnagi.2017.00400,PMC5742202,P300; affective; brainstem; cognitive; stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Baseline analysis included 351 consecutively enrolled veterans in the Translational Research Center for Traumatic Brain Injury and Stress Disorders longitudinal cohort study. One hundred eighty-six returned for a follow-up evaluation averaging 24 months post baseline. The Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) was used to measure NBS reporting. Predictor variables included diagnosis of military-related mild traumatic brain injury (M-mTBI), psychological measures, including posttraumatic stress disorder, mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders, and behavioral measures, including self-reported current pain and sleep impairment. Hierarchical and multivariable regression analyses examined the relationships between the predictor variables and NSI scores. The <i>k</i>-fold cross-validation assessed generalizability and validity of the regressions. Baseline analysis revealed that psychological and behavioral conditions independently accounted for 42.5% of variance in the NSI total score compared to 1.5% for M-mTBI after controlling for psychological and behavioral conditions. Prospective analysis revealed that M-mTBI at baseline did not significantly predict NSI score at follow-up, while psychological and behavioral measures at baseline independently accounted for 24.5% of NSI variance. Posttraumatic stress disorder was the most consistent predictor. Cross-validation analyses supported generalizability of the results. Psychological and behavioral-related measures are strong predictors of persistent NBS reporting in veterans, while M-mTBI is negligible. NBS more likely reflect influential comorbidities as opposed to brain injury, per se.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000006034,PMC6107265,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

Single case report. A 59-year-old man developed obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms after his head injury. Magnetic resonance imaging brain scans showed a small contusion in the right orbitofrontal region, and single-photon emission computed tomography revealed hypoperfusion in blood flow at the same region. The OCD symptoms that developed in the present case may be attributable primarily to hypofunction in the lesion localized to the right orbitofrontal area.

There are several cardiac manifestations of TA and an association with Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) - but not coronary vasospasm - has been previously reported. The role of emotional stress in this context is unknown. A 58-year-old Caucasian female elementary school teacher, with a history of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), severe asymptomatic aortic regurgitation (AR), and TA in remission under corticosteroids, was admitted in the emergency department with worsening chest pain and dyspnea, initiated after a period of intense emotional stress (increased workload during COVID-19 pandemic). Physical examination revealed signs of heart failure (HF) with hemodynamic stability and an early diastolic heart murmur. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, T wave inversion in left precordial and lateral leads, and a corrected QT of 487 ms. Laboratorial evaluation presented high values of high-sensitivity troponin I (3494 ng/L) and B-type natriuretic peptide (4759 pg/mL). The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe dilation of left ventricle (LV) with moderate systolic dysfunction, due to apical and midventricular akinesia, and severe AR. The coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. An acetylcholine provocative test induced spasm of both the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, accompanied by chest pain and ST depression, completely reverted after intracoronary nitrates administration. The patient was switched to diltiazem and a drug multitherapy for HF was started. A cardiac magnetic resonance revealed severe dilation of the LV, mild apical hypokinesia, improvement of ejection fraction to 53%, signs of myocardial edema and increased extracellular volume in apical and mid-ventricular anterior and anterolateral walls, and absence of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement, compatible with TTS. At discharge, the patient was clinically stable, without signs of HF, and a progressive reduction of troponin and BNP levels was observed. A final diagnosis of TTS and coronary vasospasm in a patient with GAD and TA was done. We present the first case of acute HF showing coexistence of TA, TTS and coronary vasospasm. TA is a rare inflammatory disease that can be associated with TTS and coronary vasospasm. Besides that, coronary vasospasm may also be involved in TTS pathophysiology, suggesting a complex interplay between these diseases. Mood disorders and anxiety influence the response to stress, through a gain of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and an increased cardiovascular system sensitivity to catecholamines. Therefore, although the mechanisms behind these three pathologies are not yet fully studied, this case supports the role of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases in TTS and coronary vasospasm.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.882870,PMC9108163,Takayasu's arteritis; Takotsubo syndrome; case report; catecholamines; coronary vasospasm; emotional stress; myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA),Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

We describe a non-Parkinson disease case of nonpharmacologically induced punding as a complication of a brain stem cardiovascular accident. A 54-year-old man, after an episode of brain stem cardiovascular accident secondary to basilar artery thrombosis, was noted to endlessly purchase and hoard food items and to write, copy and organize recipes. His activity was excessive, disruptive and affected his interaction with family members. The patient's punding behaviors significantly improved with an increased dose of sertraline from 100 mg to 150 mg per day.

However, few studies are confirming the importance of QEEG in the diagnosis of mental disorders and changes occurring as a result of therapy; hence, there is a need for analyses in this area. The aim of the study is analysis of the usefulness of QEEG in the diagnosis of people with generalized anxiety disorders. Our research takes the form of case studies. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the QEEG results of five recently studied people with a psychiatric diagnosis: generalized anxiety disorder. The results show specific pattern amplitudes at C3 and C4. In all of the examined patients, two dependencies are repeated: low contribution of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) wave amplitudes and high beta2 wave amplitudes, higher or equal to the alpha amplitudes. The QEEG study provides important information about the specificity of brain waves of people with generalized anxiety disorder; therefore, it enables the preliminary and quick diagnosis of dysfunction. It is also possible to monitor changes due to QEEG, occurring as a result of psychotherapy, pharmacological therapy and EEG-biofeedback.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,International journal of environmental research and public health,10.3390/ijerph19042465,PMC8879113,EEG biofeedback; QEEG; conditions; diagnosis; generalized anxiety disorder,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

She ultimately required antipsychotics for optimal symptom resolution. PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome with symptoms including irritability, anxiety, and nonfatal suicidal behavior. We discuss other potential causes of mood disturbance that are important to screen for after TBI, including depression, anxiety, and hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorders.

Surprisingly, besides the expected improvement of depression, we observed marked improvement of movement disorder that lasted as long as the patient was undergoing dTMS. She also improved her performance on neuropsychological tests of executive function and cognitive speed. Depressive symptom improvement was persistent, while anxiety symptoms recurred after the end of the sessions. dTMS may be an alternative antidepressant strategy in patients with MMs, provided that they are free from seizures.

Twenty-six patients who had undergone bilateral thermocapsulotomy were followed up 1 year after the procedure and after a mean of 13 years. Primary diagnoses were generalized anxiety disorder (N=13), panic disorder (N=8), and social phobia (N=5). Measures of psychiatric status included symptom rating scales and neuropsychological testing. Ratings were done by psychiatrists not involved in patient selection or postoperative treatment. A quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was conducted to search for common anatomic denominators. Seventeen of the 23 patients who were alive at long-term follow-up were followed up in person, and one was interviewed by telephone; the relatives of these 18 patients were interviewed. The reduction in anxiety ratings was significant both at 1-year and long-term follow-up. Seven patients, however, were rated as having substantial adverse symptoms; the most prominent adverse symptoms were apathy and dysexecutive behavior. Neuropsychological performance was significantly worse in the patients with adverse symptoms. No common anatomic denominator could be found in responders in the analysis of MRI scans. Thermocapsulotomy is an effective treatment for selected cases of nonobsessive anxiety but may carry a significant risk of adverse symptoms indicating impairment of frontal lobe functioning.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report to describe a hippocampal infarction associated with a drug overdose. A 64-year-old Japanese woman was brought to our emergency department after ingestion of an unknown dose of glyphosate surfactant herbicide in order to attempt suicide. On admission, she was assumed to be presenting with depression or psychiatric illness, however, sudden-onset memory deficit became apparent. The patient manifested delirium, confusion, and severe anxiety. In addition, short-term memory loss was prominent, with the patient forgetting her attempted suicide. Following an array of standard tests and a brain computed tomography scan (which only showed an old infraction), we performed a magnetic resonance imaging scan and neuropsychological evaluations. The brain magnetic resonance image revealed a small high-intensity lesion in the dorsal part of the left hippocampal body, and memory tests demonstrated severe short-term recall deficits. We diagnosed her with a left hippocampal infarction and administered a course of 75mg of clopidogrel. She gradually became less confused over the course of a week, and a follow-up memory test revealed partial improvement in some domains. No abnormalities were found on a follow-up brain scan. However, despite rehabilitation, memory impairments remain. It is important to note that had the symptom of short-term memory been absent or less severe, she might have been misdiagnosed with depression or another psychiatric illness. Although a computed tomography scan failed to detect hippocampal lesions, a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan clearly revealed a lesion within the left hippocampus. Therefore, in addition to assessments focusing on psychiatric illnesses that might be the root cause of an attempted suicide, organic factors should be considered along with radiological examination and precise memory assessments for diagnosing similar cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/1752-1947-8-219,PMC4088294,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Ketamine infusion (KI) has been shown to increase neuroplasticity as well as memory improvement and cervical sympathetic block (CSB) has been shown to improve cognitive function, reduce sympathetic overactivity, and improve other symptoms of PTSD. We want to report the efficacious use of a single intervention consisting of bilateral CSB technique with subanesthetic KI X5 in a Special Operations Forces patient, diagnosed with PTSD with comorbid TBI, evaluated during treatment and at 1-year follow-up. We postulated KI and CSB would have a synergistic effect. Our patient received KI starting at 0.5 mg/kg, which was escalated daily. KI was combined with right-sided ultrasound-guided CSB (C6 and C4 levels). This was followed the next day by left-sided CSB and KI. Patient's PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), suicidal ideation and other related factors by Concise Health Risk Tracking Self Report (CHRTSR). All measures were assessed prior to treatment, during treatment, and 394 days after. KI combined with CSB showed immediate and prolonged benefits 394 days later regarding the symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and cognitive deterioration (patient report). KI combined with CSB can markedly reduce symptoms of PTSD, psychiatric comorbidities, and cognitive dysfunction.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Heliyon,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14891,PMC10119561,Case report; Ketamine infusion; PTSD; Posttraumatic stress disorder; SGB; Stellate ganglion block; TBI; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,England,eng

Dental treatment is rarely associated with such an event. We report here on two middle-aged women, apparently healthy, who suffered from a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage following a dental treatment. On admission, high levels of arterial hypertension were found. It seems that trigeminal manipulation during dental treatment as well as increased serum levels of induced epinephrine mainly by stress and pain, and the small amounts absorbed from the site of local anesthesia might produce abrupt elevation of blood pressure, subsequent increase in cerebral blood flow and severe, even fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. The addition of catecholamines to local anesthetics should be considered.

A 48-year-old man presented with chronic refractory headaches and persistent disabling cognitive impairment after TBI. He was first treated with occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) implanted bilaterally to relieve headaches (8 years after the head trauma). Two years later, he was treated with a 6-week protocol combining repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered to multiple cortical sites (prefrontal cortex, language areas, and areas involved in visuo-spatial functions) and computerized cognitive training (CogT) (targeting memory, language, and visuo-spatial functions) to improve cognitive performance. Executive and cognitive functions (attention, ability to perform calculations, and verbal fluency) improved in association with pain relief after ONS (33-42% improvement) and then improved even more after the rTMS-CogT protocol with an additional improvement of 36-40% on apathy, depression, and anxiety, leading to a significant reduction in caregiver burden. The functional improvement persisted and even increased at 6 months after the end of the rTMS-CogT procedure (10 years after the onset of TBI and 2 years after ONS implantation).

A clinical case report].","Juiz-Fernández, A; Chavarría-Miranda, A; Prieto-González, A; Rodríguez-Osorio, X",Juiz-Fernández,"Psychiatric conditions are common in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. It can be extremely disabling, as it hinders the patient's integration into society. Emotional symptoms may occur during crises or can be chronic and not directly related to seizures. Some of the most common disorders are depression, followed by anxiety disorders and obsessive symptoms such as phobias. In the clinical case reported here, the patient suffers from drug-resistant focal epilepsy and psychiatric comorbidity (anxiety-depressive syndrome and phobias). In the pre-surgical evaluation, the origin of the seizures was established as the right mesial temporal region, and so surgery was performed. In check-ups, an improvement of both conditions was observed after surgery to treat her epilepsy. The activation of the amygdala and its interaction with different brain structures seem to play an important role in emotional learning and aversive stimuli, thereby conditioning (depending on its pattern of activation) the individual's ability to control their fear. There seems to be excessive activation in individuals with phobias. Surgical resection by anteromedial temporal lobectomy in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy is an effective treatment to achieve control over refractory seizures, and may also help to ease emotional symptoms, thus adding an extra benefit. A pre-surgical evaluation with a multidisciplinary approach can be used to predict post-operative neuropsychological change.",{},,Revista de neurologia,10.33588/rn.7510.2022145,PMC10280768,,Case Reports; English Abstract,Spain,spa

We present a new psychological intervention designed to reduce depressive complaints after stroke. This intervention was based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles and was shown feasible in a pilot study. In order to meet the specific needs of stroke patients (concerning both sensori-motor, cognitive, and behavioural problems), we incorporated motivational interviewing, grief resolution, and psycho-education. We emphasised for each session to take into account the cognitive deficits of the patients (i.e. be concrete, accessible, structured, specific, and repeat information). Moreover, we augmented the psychologist-administered therapy with the contribution of an occupational or movement therapist aimed at facilitating patients' goal-setting and attainment. The intervention consisted of 12 one-hour sessions with a psychologist and three or four one-hour sessions with an occupational or movement therapist. Currently, the effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. The proposed psychological treatment protocol is innovative, as it applies cognitive behavioural therapy in a stroke-specific manner; moreover, it supports goal attainment by incorporating occupational or movement therapy sessions.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Clinical rehabilitation,10.1177/0269215514559987,,Stroke; anxiety; cognitive behavioural therapy; depression; treatment protocol,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Over half of the patients who exhibit APH have pre-existing primary hypertension. Sustained blood pressure (BP) elevation increases the risk of myocardial ischemia, infarction, surgical site bleeding, or cerebral hemorrhage in these patients. Following surgery and anesthesia, increased sympathetic stimulation caused by a high level of circulating catecholamines can lead to APH. Some direct perioperative stimulants include pain, anxiety, hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypothermia, shivering, volume overload, and bladder distension. Nursing interventions are directed toward identifying and relieving the cause of APH. Antihypertensive drug therapy with vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors is used if initial nursing interventions are not effective. Vasodilators frequently used are hydralazine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin. Nicardipine has recently been introduced as an intravenous calcium channel blocker. Vasodilators are effective in BP reduction but may cause reflex tachycardia when used alone. Adrenergic inhibitors, such as esmolol and labetalol, block alpha and/or beta receptors to decrease heart rate and BP.

His medical history was significant for traumatic brain injury, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), major depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, and anxiety. Bing Neel syndrome is a rare central nervous system complication of WM. His wife reported an abrupt mental deterioration starting 5 years before his death, characterized by paranoia, depression, and insomnia. He had been a high-functioning university professor. His decline culminated with the loss of independence in his activities of daily living. At autopsy, it was found that he experienced blunt force injuries related to the fall, causing his death. A neuropathologic examination revealed a brisk and fulminant clonal CD20 + /immunoglobulin M+ lymphocytic infiltrate, involving all sampled regions of his brain, consistent with WM. This workup was critical to obtaining an accurate pathologic diagnosis of BNS and understanding his full clinical status before death. Although BNS was not the proximate cause of death, this diagnosis aided the death investigation as a causal factor in his suicidality and was vital to providing his family closure.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of forensic medicine and pathology,10.1097/PAF.0000000000000824,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In the pump interrogation and actual reservoir checks performed 6 h after the MRI scan, there was no significant difference between the expected reservoir volume and actual reservoir volume. Follow-up MRI performed to rule out posterior circulation infarction showed no structural lesions. The patient was eventually discharged without further neurologic or functional deterioration, with diagnosis of transient ischemia attack for initial symptoms of focal neurologic deficits. Although both ex vivo and in vivo studies have provided evidence that ITDAS devices are MRI-compatible, the pump is made of titanium and has ferromagnetic components. Since misdiagnosis of overinfusion could lead to mortality, early awareness of overinfusion of the intrathecal drug is needed to all clinicians in case of performing MRI in ITDAS implanted patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02176-x,PMC8020534,Case report; Intrathecal drug administration system; Magnetic resonance imaging; Morphine overdose,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The poor prognosis combined with intensive treatment necessitates the inclusion of complementary and supportive therapies that optimize quality of life and reduce treatment-related declines in health. Exercise therapy has been shown to be beneficial in other cancer populations, but no evidence is available for brain cancer survivors. Therefore, we report results from 2 preliminary cases. Methods Two female patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme and oligodendroglioma participated in a structured and supervised 12-week exercise program. The program consisted of two 1-hour resistance and aerobic exercise sessions per week and additional self-managed aerobic sessions. Outcome measures of strength, cardiovascular fitness, and several psychological indicators (depression, anxiety, and quality of life) were recorded at baseline, after 6 weeks and at the conclusion of the intervention. Results Exercise was well tolerated; both participants completed all 24 sessions and the home-based component with no adverse effects. Objective outcome measures displayed positive responses relating to reduced morbidity. Similar positive responses were found for psychological outcomes. Scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed clinically meaningful improvements in depression and total distress. Conclusion These findings provide initial evidence that, despite the difficulties associated with brain cancer treatment and survivorship, exercise may be safe and beneficial and should be considered in the overall management of patients with brain cancer.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Integrative cancer therapies,10.1177/1534735415600068,PMC5736053,anxiety; comprehensive cancer care; depression; exercise oncology; neuro-oncology,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe a patient presenting with the potentially devastating signs and symptoms of thalamic stroke, at least temporally related to spinal cord stimulator implantation. The etiology of the patient's affliction was subsequently revealed to be a conversion disorder. Case report A 37-year-old woman presented for spinal cord stimulation as treatment of her brachial plexopathy after failure of conservative therapy. Before implantation, she underwent a clinical interview with a psychologist and psychometric testing. No psychological pathology was detected. Trial and permanent implantation of the cervical stimulator lead and pulse generator were uneventful. Eleven days after receiving the permanent implant, the patient experienced right-sided hemicorporal numbness and burning dysesthesia. The patient was admitted, and a diagnosis of Dejerine-Roussy syndrome (thalamic stroke) was made. She was discharged, and her symptomatology waxed and waned over a period of weeks. The patient was subsequently admitted for psychiatric evaluation because of anxiety attacks. During her protracted admission, her psychiatrists strongly suspected a conversion disorder. The stimulator was removed, and the patient received supportive care only. Within 6 months, sensory symptoms and all motor deficits had completely resolved. Despite careful preoperative evaluation, latent psychosocial issues may limit the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation.

The study describes the exploration and successful cognitive behavioural treatment of a case of seizure phobia in a 26 year old woman with a 9 year history of epilepsy following a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The findings represent an important development in the much-neglected study of seizure fear. The case highlights some of the factors which may contribute to the genesis and maintenance of epilepsy-related psychopathologies and consequently has important implications for theoretical modelling in this area.

Oral myiasis occurs when soft tissues of the oral cavity are invaded by the larvae of flies. It is not a common disease for the reason that the oral cavity is not easily reachable for the fly to lay eggs. But it can cause pain, infection, uncomfortable feeling when the worms move, tissue destruction and/or even life-threatening hemorrhages. We reported a case of oral myiasis after cerebral infarction in a 78-year-old male patient from southern China (Guangdong Zhanjiang). As a result of cerebral infarction, he suffered from right hemiplegia, mobility and mental decline for about 3 mo. He had difficulty swallowing and was fed <i>via</i> a feeding tube. He mostly engaged in mouth breathing and had poor oral and dental hygiene. More than 20 live larvae were collected from the patient's oral cavity, which were localized in the maxillary gingiva, the mandibular gingiva and the tongue.

GFAP astrocytopathy can coexist with a variety of antibodies, which is known as overlap syndrome. Anti-NMDAR-positive encephalitis overlap syndrome has been reported; however, encephalitis overlap syndrome with both anti-NMDAR and sulfatide-IgG positivity has not been reported. The patient was a 50-year-old male who was drowsy and had chills and weak limbs for 6 months. His symptoms worsened after admission to our hospital with persistent high fever, dysphoria, gibberish, and disturbance of consciousness. Positive cerebrospinal fluid NMDA, GFAP antibodies, and serum sulfatide antibody IgG were positive. Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy with anti-NMDAR and sulfatide-IgG-positive encephalitis overlap syndrome. In addition to ventilator support and symptomatic supportive treatment, step-down therapy with methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d, halved every 3 days) and pulse therapy with human immunoglobulin (0.4 g/(kg d) for 5 days) were used. After 6 days of treatment, the patient condition did not improve, and the family signed up to give up the treatment and left the hospital. Patients with autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy may be positive for anti-NMDAR and sulfatide-IgG, and immunotherapy may be effective in patients with severe conditions. Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy with nonspecific symptoms is rarely reported and is easy to be missed and misdiagnosed. GFAP astrocytopathy should be considered in patients with fever, headache, disturbance of consciousness, convulsions, and central infections that do not respond to antibacterial and viral agents.

This case involves a 34-year-old woman presenting with a gradual onset of slurred speech. The initial CT scan of head did not indicate any intracranial pathology, and she was initially treated for an anxiety/conversion disorder. With progression of the pathology, the patient quickly developed a 'locked-in' syndrome, with preserved high cognitive function and vertical eye movement, but otherwise total loss of motor function. The diagnosis was confirmed with MRI/MR angiography studies, which indicated thrombosis of the proximal basilar artery.

Here, we describe clinical, neuroradiological and neurobiological findings of a 28-year-old male presenting with IgM NMDAR antibodies coincident with autoimmune encephalitis characterized by symptoms of bipolar disorder. After repeated steroid treatment, cognitive and psychiatric abnormalities improved and no NMDAR antibody was detectable. Using primary neuronal cultures, we demonstrate that patient's serum containing IgM NMDAR antibodies reduced the detection of NMDAR on neuronal cells and decreased cell survival. Although NMDAR encephalitis with IgG antibodies is increasingly recognized and diagnosed, atypical presentations with NMDAR antibodies with immunoglobulin subclasses other than IgG pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Further clinical and neurobiological studies are needed to study the pathophysiological relevance of IgM NMDAR antibodies.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Psychiatry research,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.09.035,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Ireland,eng

Large tumors also cause elevated intracranial pressure that may lead to a disturbance of consciousness. Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident that the cerebellum plays a substantial role in cognitive and affective processing. A 44-year-old female patient presented with a 1-month history of depression and flat affect. She had no cerebellar symptoms including no coordination dysfunction or dysarthria. Cognitive function tests revealed impairments in attention, execution, and processing speed. Hamilton Depression Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale indicated moderate-to-severe depression. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a 7-mm enhancing lesion in the culmen of the cerebellar vermis with surrounding edema. Technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion in the left frontal lobe. Although she was initially treated with corticosteroids for presumed sero-negative autoimmune encephalitis, her symptoms persisted. She then underwent cerebellar lesion resection. The histologic diagnosis was hemangioblastoma. The patient's symptoms dramatically improved within 1 week of resection, including improved batteries for cognitive function and depression. Complete regression of cerebellar edema and left frontal lobe hypoperfusion was observed on MR and SPECT images, respectively. This case reiterates the crucial influence of the cerebellum on cognitive and affective function. Moreover, cognitive dysfunction may be masked in cases with focal cerebellar symptoms or elevated intracranial pressure and, consequently, not adequately evaluated.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neurology,10.1212/WNL.0000000000207509,PMC10516281,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Our experience emphasises the fact that limbic encephalitis is not easy to identify as most patients initially present with psychiatric symptomatology than neurological symptoms. Furthermore, immunological and laboratory testing takes a rather long time to determine the diagnosis. What is more, few psychiatrists consider autoimmune nature of the neuropsychiatric presentation.

The progression of psychiatric symptoms led to a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder and treatment with antidepressants and anxiolytics. Due to cognitive and psychiatric symptoms, autoimmune encephalitis was considered, but no improvement was shown with treatment. Early onset dementia was suspected, and a brain PET scan revealed frontal lobe hypometabolism. An adverse effect of LNG-IUS was considered; after its removal, mood and cognitive function improvements were observed. This case report emphasizes the importance of considering organic causes of unexplained psychiatric manifestations and highlights the potential impact of hormonal interventions on mental health.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1266419,PMC10535084,adverse event; anxiety; contraception; depressive cognitive disorder; hormonal contraceptive; progestin-only contraceptive,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
28953839,Antidepressants and Hyponatremia in a patient with Colectomy - a Case Report.,"Seshadri, Madhavan; Thalitaya, Madhusudan Deepak; Simon, Tuno; Odelola, Catherine; Enow, Humphrey",Seshadri,"Antidepressants are routinely used by General Practitioners (GP) as well as Psychiatrists to treat Depression. They are tolerated well. However, in certain patient populations, they are associated with SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone Secretion) and Hyponatremia. Various research studies have shown that all antidepressants are associated with Hyponatremia. Hyponatremia as a side effect of antidepressant therapy is more commonly seen in old age, chronic Kidney disease and Hypothyroidism. Untreated Hyponatremia could lead to life threatening emergencies including Cerebral oedema, brain damage and coma. In this article, the authors discuss a 63 year old patient who suffered from Bipolar Disorder Type 2. He was treated with antidepressants (mainly Paroxetine) on and off for 30 years, without much side effects, until 2014. In July 2012, he underwent subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis as a management of adeno carcinoma of Colon. In April 2013, Paroxetine was stopped as he was well. He developed first episode of mania in July 2014. This was managed with Olanzapine. However, he soon developed a Depressive episode and severe Anxiety. He was restarted on Paroxetine and the dose was increased up to 50 mg along with Olanzapine 15 mg per day. As he did not improve, he was switched to Sertraline with which he developed Hyponatremia. Further to this, he was tried on Venlafaxine and Lofepramine and he developed Hyponatremia with both of them. Considering the severity of Depression, he was started on Mirtazapine and the dose was titrated to 45 mg. With this dose his serum Sodium levels were stable but his Depression persisted. Fluoxetine augmentation at this stage by the GP led to another episode of Hyponatremia. Hence, he was started on Aripiprazole 5 mg as an augmentation agent. His Depression improved reasonably (though he did not remit fully). Recently, he has been started on Vortioxetine and the dose has been titrated to 15 mg OD and in addition, he is on Mirtazapine 45 mg OD and Aripiprazole 5 mg OD. His Sodium levels have been stable and his Depression has improved. This is the first time we have come across a patient with colectomy developing severe Hyponatremia. In this article, we have discussed possible reasons for Hyponatremia following colectomy and the management strategies that could help.",{},,Psychiatria Danubina,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Croatia,eng

Indeed, there have been few cases of hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas with a cystic component. We report a rare case of subclinical acromegaly that presented as a cystic sellar lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A 34-year-old Caucasian female presented with arthralgias, diaphoresis, paresthesias, cognitive slowing, headaches, presyncope, anxiety, and depression. She underwent evaluation by multiple providers without a diagnosis. Her physical examination was reportedly normal without evidence to suggest acromegaly. While she was undergoing workup for multiple sclerosis, a brain MRI scan revealed a cystic sellar lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.9 cm approaching the optic chiasm. An insulin-like growth factor 1 level was incidentally screened months later and was elevated at 823 ng/mL (reference range is 69 to 227 ng/mL). A subsequent oral glucose tolerance test reported a growth hormone level of 7.5 ng/mL at its nadir (reference range is <1.0 ng/mL). Additional assessment of the pituitary axis reported normal levels of prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, cosyntropin stimulation test, and a normal 24-hour urinary free cortisol collection. The patient underwent transsphenoidal surgery and her pathology reported a somatroph tumor that stained positive for GH and alpha subunit. No postsurgical complications were noted and postoperative MRIs did not demonstrate evidence of tumor recurrence. Cystic pituitary adenomas can secret GH and may present with no classic clinical features of acromegaly. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough hormonal evaluation in patients who present with a cystic pituitary incidentaloma.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,AACE clinical case reports,10.4158/ACCR-2018-0245,PMC6876966,,Case Reports,United States,eng

Surgical methods with proven efficacy have been proposed for only a small group of psychiatric diseases, while in practice non-classical clinical situations are seen rather often. A 36-year-old man with a 18-year history of ""schizophrenia with a predominant obsessive-compulsive syndrome"" was referred to the Burdenko National Medical Research Center of Neurosurgery for consideration of neurosurgical treatment. Based on results of longitudinal independent evaluations of the patient in several specialized clinical centers the disease was considered resistant to medical therapy. Radiosurgical procedure was performed by means of Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion™ (Elekta AB; Stockholm, Sweden). Ventral portion of the anterior limb of internal capsule was targeted with two 4-mm isocenters on each side, with prescription dose at 50% isodose line of 80 Gy and a maximal dose of 160 Gy. No obvious complications or side effects were noted during 13-month follow-up after radiosurgery. Gradual clinical improvement was observed with 25% reduction of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score at 13 months after treatment. Similarly, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety and depression scores decreased by 24% and 58%, respectively. This is the first published case of radiosurgical treatment of a psychiatric disorder in Russia. It demonstrates the potential efficacy of Gamma Knife capsulotomy for non-classical forms of obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbid with schizophrenia.

Participants completed an 8-week headache diary and a battery of clinical questionnaires prior to each fNIRS session. <i>fNIRS:</i> Hemodynamic changes were recorded over the frontoparietal cortex during rest, finger tapping, and a graded working memory test. fNIRS was completed pre-rTMS, following rTMS (day 14), and at 1-month post-rTMS (day 45). For comparison, two healthy, sex-matched controls were scanned with fNIRS once daily for five consecutive days. <b>Results:</b> Clinical scores improved (headache severity, MoCA, HIT-6, PHQ-9, GAD-7, QOLIBRI, RPSQ, BCPSI) or remained stable (PCL-5, headache frequency) post-rTMS, for both participants. Participant 1 reported <i>moderate</i> symptom burden, and a fNIRS task-evoked hemodynamic response showing increased oxyhemoglobin was observed following a working memory task, as expected. Participant 2 exhibited a <i>high</i> symptom burden pre-treatment, with <i>abnormal</i> fNIRS hemodynamic response where oxyhemoglobin declined, in response to task. One month following rTMS treatment, participant 2 had a normal fNIRS hemodynamic response to task, corresponding to significant improvements in clinical outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This case study suggests fNIRS may be sensitive to physiological changes that accompany rTMS treatment.

With decreasing age, a child's ability to cooperate and mange an awake craniotomy becomes increasingly relevant. Preoperative screening is essential to identify the child who can undergo the procedure safely. <i>Case Description.</i> A 11-year-old female patient presented with a tumour in her right motor cortex, presumed to be a dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET). We had concerns regarding the feasibility of performing awake surgery in this patient as psychological testing revealed easy distractibility and an inability to follow commands repetitively. We devised a simulated surgical experience to assess her ability to manage such a procedure. During the simulated theatre experience, attempts were made to replicate the actual theatre experience as closely as possible. The patient was dressed in theatre attire and brought into the theatre on a theatre trolley. She was then transferred onto the theatre bed and positioned in the same manner as she would be for the actual surgery. Her head was placed on a horseshoe headrest, and she was made to lie in a semilateral position, as required for the surgery. A blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, nasal cannula with oxygen flow, and calf pumps were applied. She was then draped precisely as she would have been for the procedure. Theatre lighting was set as it would be for the surgical case. The application of the monitoring devices, nasal cannula, and draping was meant not only to prepare her for the procedure but to induce a mild degree of stress such that we could assess the child's coping skills and ability to undergo the procedure. The child performed well throughout the simulated run, and surgery was thus offered. An asleep-awake-asleep technique was planned and employed for surgical removal of the tumour. Cortical and subcortical mapping was used to identify the eloquent tissue. Throughout the procedure, the child was cooperative and anxiety free. Follow-up MRI revealed gross total removal of the lesion. A simulated theatre experience allowed us to accurately determine that this young patient, despite relative contraindications, was indeed eligible for awake surgery. We will continue to use this technique for all our young patients in assessing their eligibility for these procedures.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Case reports in anesthesiology,10.1155/2020/6902075,PMC7361895,,Case Reports,United States,eng

Furthermore, failure to incorporate timely detection and management of symptoms increases the risk of partially avoidable complications. A promising approach to overcome these pitfalls is telenursing, which entails proactive care delivery by a PD Nurse Specialist (PDNS) through telephone contacts. We hypothesized that adding telenursing to usual care could fill a gap in currently available services, including offering patients easy accessibility to a nurse with specific expertise in PD. We explored this hypothesis by prospectively assessing the effects of a telenursing intervention on motor and non-motor symptoms in a patient with PD. During a threemonth intervention period which comprised 13 telephone contacts, the patient reported a remarkable reduction in number of falls, from 99 falls per three months to 3 falls per three months; and a reduction in non-motor symptoms. The main working mechanism was presumably rather indirect and mediated via alleviation of anxiety, achieved by the individually tailored information and problem-solving strategies provided by the PDNS. Our observations should encourage large-scale evaluations to assess the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telenursing interventions in persons with PD.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Clinical parkinsonism & related disorders,10.1016/j.prdoa.2020.100070,PMC7437514,Health care delivery; Home care; Parkinsons disease; Telehealth; Telenursing,Case Reports,England,eng

Some of these factors are amenable to treatment, and clinicians can impact clients' likelihood of returning to work by intervening in various ways. Through case studies and a literature review on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions, we have outlined specific strategies and recommendations for interventions. Cognitive rehabilitation strategies that address attention, memory and executive deficits can improve clients' abilities to manage workplace tasks and demands.

Multiple regression analysis using a random-effects model determined the significance of each variable in the occurrence of AEs. 2,468 patients (aged 20 months to 98 years; 112 < or =17 years; 141 > or =66 years) received DROP for agitation (n = 1,357), pain (1,135), anxiety (99), vomiting (173), or other reasons (50). There were 945 pts considered high risk; 933 charts were reviewed (DROP mean dose 4.1 +/- 2.0 mg); of these, 50 patient visits did not meet the criteria for high risk. There were 622 pts with head trauma (401 with alcohol use), including 47 with computed tomography (CT) scans positive for brain injury, 64 with cocaine use, and 197 with recent or remote seizures (137 with alcohol use). Minor AEs such as transient hypotension occurred in 96 pts after DROP (73 with alcohol use); 20 received intravenous fluids, while an additional 28 pts (8 with alcohol use) received rescue medications for EPSEs. Six possible serious AEs occurred in pts with serious comorbidities; 2 cases of respiratory depression, 3 post-DROP seizures, and 1 cardiac arrest (resuscitated) 11 hours after DROP in a cocaine-intoxicated pt (normal QT interval). There was no significant difference among high-risk groups in the occurrence of AEs. The vast majority of pts who received DROP in the ED did not experience an AE. A few serious AEs were noted following DROP in patients with serious comorbidities; it is not clear that DROP was causative.",{},,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,10.1111/j.1553-2712.2002.tb01609.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A 45-year-old female after successful neuro-ophthalmic surgery of the meningioma, complained of severe pain and anxiety, difficulties with sleeping, attention and memory problems, as well as inability to continue working in her given profession. Neuropsychological testing showed lack of cognitive disturbances and post-operative depression. Two working hypotheses were tested to find neuromarkers of depression and anxiety. In line with the 'depression hypothesis' a frontal alpha asymmetry pattern was found in the patient, and in line with the 'anxiety' hypothesis an increased left temporal P1 wave in response to visual stimuli was found in ERPs. A specific alpha asymmetry neurofeedback protocol combined with an anodal tDCS was suggested. Twenty sessions of individually-tailored anodal tDCs/ neurofeedback protocol were performed. The QEEG frontal asymmetry pattern and the excessive temporal P1 wave were normalized after the intervention. The patient recovered from post-operative depression and returned to work after 20 sessions of the combined neurofeedback/tDCS protocol.

However, there is a notable paucity of psychological interventions which have been tested with adult BT patients. An acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based manualized program was developed for anxious and/or depressed BT patients. The preliminary efficacy of this program was initially tested using a proof-of-concept study design based on a case series of four clinically distressed BT patients. Three of the four participants no longer met criteria for anxiety and/or depressive disorders at post-therapy, and these effects were maintained at 3 months of follow-up. The fourth participant, who had a premorbid psychiatric history, experienced a stabilization of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Given the current dearth of studies which have tested psychological interventions for distressed BT survivors, these preliminary findings have promising clinical utility. However, the efficacy of psychological interventions tailored for clinically distressed BT patients needs to be further tested using larger-scale controlled trial designs.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,10.1007/s00520-015-2804-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

We describe a case of PRES that arose in the context of a psychiatric disorder. The patient was a 26-year-old woman with schizophrenia who was hospitalized upon falling into a catatonic stupor and then suffered acute anxiety leading to impulsive polydipsia and subsequent water intoxication. She lost consciousness, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a high density area, primarily affecting the cortex and subcortical white matter in areas in the occipital and parietal lobes, leading to the diagnosis. We did not treat the hyponatremia by means of aggressive sodium supplementation but rather balanced the extracellular fluid by continuous infusion of isotonic electrolyte replacement fluid. The patient's level of consciousness improved gradually, but a total 141 days passed before hospital discharge was appropriate. The prognosis for PRES is generally favorable, but irreversible neurological damage can occur. We believe, therefore, that brain magnetic resonance imaging should be performed promptly whenever PRES is suspected and that timely, appropriate treatment is of utmost importance. If PRES is observed in a psychiatric patient, it is important to investigate whether the condition might have been caused by water intoxication and to treat the condition accordingly.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,International medical case reports journal,10.2147/IMCRJ.S237430,PMC7150669,posterior reversible encephalopathy; schizophrenia; water intoxication,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

A subsequent SPECT demonstrated an increase in cerebral blood flow to normal levels, which coincided with improvement of agoraphobic symptoms and disappearance of visual distortions on further follow-up.

The acute phase of rehabilitation poses difficulties for amnestic individuals that may elicit classic PTA symptoms as well as premorbid PTSS, thereby activating maladaptive cognitions and an increase in agitation and arousal. Historically, explicit learning and memory strategies were considered non-efficacious with amnestic individuals until PTA resolves; therefore, rehabilitation therapies have utilized implicit learning in the initial phases of recovery. However, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which uses explicit learning and memory strategies based on cognitive, trauma, and neuropsychology lowers agitation and confusion for amnestic individuals with PTSS. In this paper, two case studies present preliminary evidence for effective implicit learning following a CBT intervention for individuals in PTA after a severe TBI receiving care. Notably, following a CBT intervention, agitation, confusion, and arousal were diminished despite having no recollection of the intervention. Thus, these cases suggest amnestic individuals in the acute recovery stage after severe TBI benefit from CBT to replace maladaptive attributions minimizing PTA and PTSS (e.g., confusion, arousal, and agitation) and improving motivation, participation, and recovery.",{},,Military medicine,10.1093/milmed/usy179,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on cTBS applied to manage NB after stroke. Our treatment has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in enhancing bladder and kidney function, improving the overall quality of life, and alleviating anxiety and depression symptoms in this patient. This case study concludes that the noninvasive neuromodulation approach exhibits significant potential in the clinical field when addressing this specific patient population.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.56993,PMC11050733,case report; continuous theta burst stimulation; neurogenic bladder; noninvasive neuromodulation; primary motor cortex; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng
38356258,Anesthetic Considerations for Patients with Locked-In Syndrome Undergoing Endoscopic Procedures.,"Barakat, Monique T; Banerjee, Subhas; Angelotti, Timothy",Barakat,"BACKGROUND Delivering safe anesthetic care to a patient unable to communicate easily and effectively with the anesthesia team presents many unique challenges. Communication may be limited by language, which can be resolved with translation services, or neurological conditions, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury, which are not easily remedied. In such patients, the inability to communicate effectively can lead to anxiety and negatively impact the patient-anesthesiologist relationship, especially when higher cognitive functions are preserved. CASE REPORT We present a case of a patient with locked-in syndrome (LIS), who presented to our endoscopy unit for a routine colonoscopy. The patient could only communicate with eye movements and blinking, thus limiting our ability to assess their pain or other needs in the perioperative period; however, she was otherwise cognitively intact. By utilizing the patient's home healthcare team and quickly adapting their unique communication methods during the perioperative period, we were able to provide an appropriate, safe anesthetic for this patient with LIS. CONCLUSIONS Many patients requiring an anesthetic are unable to effectively communicate due to language issues, hearing loss/mutism, neurological injury/stroke (aphasia), or developmental disabilities. The unique communication needs of this patient with LIS went beyond utilizing a translator and required the healthcare team to quickly learn a new communication method. We also discuss forms of intraoperative monitoring that can be used to differentiate consciousness from the anesthetized state in LIS patients, as well as making recommendations for future care of such patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942906,PMC10877638,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Patients may suffer changes in personality ranging from disinhibition to apathy. Beneficial effects of traumatic brain injury are rarely described. We report three cases of patients who sustained frontal traumatic brain injury, one of whose social phobia resolved and the other two of whom had an improvement in impulsive and antisocial behavior. In one case the brain injury may have caused disinhibition of an inhibited state; in the other cases disinhibition associated with impulsivity was replaced by a more restrained state.

Recognizing the particular form of catastrophic reaction is important both to determine proper behavioral management and to help patients accept the effects of the brain injury. Applying Kohutian theory and self psychology constructs, the authors present several case studies to show how the patients shared the same underlying experience of shame and anxiety over their injury-related impairments. These patients participated in an outpatient, milieu-oriented rehabilitation program intended to increase their independence at home and to facilitate their return to productive work. The rehabilitation therapist's role was to help patients move from a state of being unable to accept their deficits to one of setting and pursuing attainable goals.

Treatment with benzodiazepines failed; lorazepam therapy obscured our ability to do reliable neurological testing to follow his brain injury and nearly resulted in intubation of the patient secondary to respiratory suppression. Upon admission to hospital, the patient was first treated with intermittent, prophylactic doses of lorazepam for potential alcohol withdrawal based upon our institution's standard of care. His neurological examinations including a motor score of 6 (obeying commands) on his Glasgow Coma Scale testing, laboratory studies, and repeat CT head imaging remained stable. For lack of published literature in diagnosing symptoms of patients with a history of both alcohol withdrawal and traumatic brain injury, a diagnosis of agitation secondary to presumed alcohol withdrawal was made when the patient developed acute onset of tachycardia, confusion, and extreme anxiety with tremor and attempts to climb out of bed requiring him to be restrained. Additional lorazepam doses were administered following a hospital-approved protocol for titration of benzodiazepine therapy for alcohol withdrawal. The patient's mental status and respiratory function deteriorated with the frequent lorazepam dosing needed to control his agitation. Dexmedetomidine IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/h was then administered and was titrated ultimately to 1.5 mcg/kg/h. After 8 days of therapy with dexmedetomidine, the patient was transferred from the ICU to a step-down unit with an intact neurological examination and no evidence of alcohol withdrawal. Airway intubation was avoided during the patient's entire hospitalization. This case report highlights the intricate balance between the side effects of benzodiazepine sedation for treatment of agitation and the difficulties of monitoring the neurological status of non-intubated patients with traumatic brain injury. Given the large numbers of alcohol-dependent patients who suffer a traumatic brain injury and subsequently develop agitation and alcohol withdrawal in hospital, dexmedetomidine offers a novel strategy to facilitate sedation without neurological or respiratory depression. As this case report demonstrates, dexmedetomidine is an emerging treatment option for agitation in patients who require reliable, serial neurological testing to monitor the course of their traumatic brain injury.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-009-9315-8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The most well-known is cognitive impairment and depression in hypothyroid patients, as well as an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents. A separate, although a rare entity, is Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Unlike encephalopathy associated with other conditions, management in Hashimoto's encephalopathy highly responds to steroid treatment and may be associated with normal thyroid profile at presentation. Hashimoto's encephalopathy, while rare, may have been under-recognised since its clinical presentation overlaps several more common disorders, such as depression, seizures or anxiety. We present two cases of hypothyroidism with peculiar presentation. The first case has rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction, normal thyroid function at presentation, normal MRI finding and responds to steroid treatment. The second case has a subacute progressive neurological deterioration with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone titre at presentation. Both these cases are known hypothyroidism on regular thyroxin replacement therapy with elevated anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. We conclude that Hashimoto's encephalopathy can present with a wide spectrum of neurological illnesses in the setting of hypothyroidism. Thyroid status may vary from hypothyroid, normothyroid to even hyperthyroid. This condition usually has an abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) background and usually responds to high dose steroids.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr.01.2010.2630,PMC3027635,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A myriad of evidence demonstrates that clinically significant depression can often follow a stroke. However, less is known about the extent to which anxiety disorders present after these experiences, and in particular, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with panic attacks. To our knowledge, the association between transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and PTSD with panic attacks has not been described in the literature. Here we describe a patient with depression and PTSD with panic attacks following a transient ischemic attack. Many non-psychiatric physicians learn about post-stroke depression so they are equipped to screen for it. However, to many physicians, PTSD with panic attacks usually conjures the image of an individual who experienced either trauma or rape. Therefore, it is important to increase the awareness of such complications after TIAs. Increased awareness of these TIA sequelae has important implications for detection by non-psychiatric healthcare providers. Furthermore, prompt recognition and treatment has important implications for patient quality of life.",{},,International journal of psychiatry in medicine,10.2190/8672-8623-8460-7K45,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This is partly because of concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria. In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study. Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure. The stimulation was well tolerated and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2014.09.010,,Brain injuries; Case report; Depression; Rehabilitation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Two case studies are provided to illustrate the implementation of the programme, as a step toward larger scale testing of the programme's feasibility. A manualised adapted CBT treatment manual was used to deliver CBT in a standardised manner to two clients, one with severe and one with moderate TBI. Outcome was evaluated using a single-subject design with repeated measures of anxiety, mood and coping style at pre- and post-CBT. The two clients demonstrated positive treatment response on either a measure of anxiety or a continuous measure of distress. Although neither demonstrated a clinically significant change according to the primary outcome measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), they showed significant change in at least one corroborated measure of anxiety.

28290971,Delayed Diagnosis of TSH-Secreting Adenoma Attributed to Worsening Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in a Military Veteran Because of Provider Anchoring Bias.,"Daya, Shyam K; Paulus, Andrew O; Braxton, Ernest E; Vroman, Penny J; Mathis, Derek A; Lin, Ryan; True, Mark W",Daya,"Anchoring bias occurs when clinicians hold on to previously known information about a patient, with failure to consider the full realm of possibilities to explain new findings. We present a case of delayed diagnosis of thyroid-stimulating-hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma), a rare disorder, in a military veteran whose symptoms were misconstrued as being caused from worsening of his prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anchoring bias in this case led to 2-year delay in the correct diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic results are presented. We report a case of a 44-year-old retired male Army soldier with a prior diagnosis of PTSD who was evaluated for new symptoms including headaches, blurry vision, palpitations, and anxiety. These symptoms were considered by multiple services as worsening of his PTSD, with acknowledgment of normal thyroid hormone levels from 2 years prior, but with no levels at the time of the new presentation. Attempts to treat with standard PTSD therapies were unsuccessful. When thyroid hormone levels were eventually rechecked 2 years later, he was found to have an inappropriately normal level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (1.9 mcIU/mL) in the setting of elevated free thyroxine (2.30 pg/mL) and free triiodothyronine (5.8 ng/dL). With magnetic resonance imaging revealing a 1.4-cm pituitary macroadenoma, he was diagnosed with a TSHoma. A trial of octreotide, a somatostatin analog, was attempted to shrink the tumor size. However, because of the patient's intolerance of this medication, he underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery as definitive treatment. Pathologic analysis of his tumor was consistent with TSHoma. On various follow-up intervals, he had normalization of thyroid function tests, no evidence of residual tumor on 6-month postoperative imaging, and reported improvement in his symptoms. This case highlights the details of a rare diagnosis of TSHoma, which has an estimated 1 to 2 cases per million in the general population and an unknown prevalence in the military population, in a veteran who had symptoms that were presumed to be worsening PTSD. While understandable to attribute new symptoms to pre-existing diagnoses such as PTSD, clinicians should consider the possibility of alternative diagnoses and perform the routine workup when indicated.",{},,Military medicine,10.7205/MILMED-D-16-00241,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

6599230,Role of the visceral brain in body equilibrium.,"Hinoki, M",Hinoki,"A series of examinations were carried out to determine whether the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus and the amygdaloid nucleus, participates in the production of disequilibrium of the eyes and the body and to clarify the conditions which induce disequilibrium. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's hippocampus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in this part of the brain, through which dysfunction of equilibrium center in the brain stem is eventually brought about. This dysfunction leads to disequilibrium of the eyes and the body. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for neurotic vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that in a certain group of traumatized patients who suffer from vertigo of psychosomatic origin, there are two etiological factors: functional linkage between the temporal cortex and the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus in regard to a memory or a conditioned reflex relevant to vertigo, over-excitation of the adrenergic components involved in the brain connecting the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and equilibrium centers in the brain stem. These two etiological factors induce disequilibrium by a trigger-and-target relationship in which the former acts as a trigger and the latter as a target. The cerebellum is not an essential factor in producing vertigo of psychosomatic origin, but it enhances vertigo of this type through activation of the adrenergic components, particularly those in the hippocampus. Thus, in patients with both vertigo of psychosomatic origin and cerebellar symptoms recovery from vertigo tends to be delayed. Over-stimulation of the rabbit's amygdaloid nucleus, particularly its medial portion and the habenular nucleus induces over-excitation of adrenergic components involved in these parts of the brain. These animals develop disequilibrium of the eyes in response to an olfactory stimulus, such as extract of garlic. On the basis of these results, equilibrium tests for olfactory vertigo were devised. Using these equilibrium tests we noted that traumatized patients who suffered from vertigo due to inhalation of garlic vapor showed hyper-reactivity to adrenaline and developed disequilibrium of the eyes and the body when given a subcutaneous injection of this drug. These findings indicate that olfactory vertigo is induced by a mechanism in which olfactory stimulation affects the above adrenergic components, causing disequilibrium of the eyes and the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",{},,Acta oto-laryngologica.

Besides, the scores of Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale showed a significant reduction. However, the superficial sensory of the alar and nasolabial groove on the left side still decreased mildly when compared with the right side.

38303088,"Outcome of severe COVID-19: spotlight on fatigue, fatigability, multidomain complaints and pattern of cognitive deficits in a case series without prior brain dysfunction and without COVID-19-related stroke and/or cardiac arrest.","Beaud, Valérie; Crottaz-Herbette, Sonia; Dunet, Vincent; Knebel, Jean-François; Bart, Pierre-Alexandre; Clarke, Stephanie",Beaud,"Population-wide surveys and large-scale investigations highlighted the presence of cognitive deficits in the acute and postacute stages of severe COVID-19; a few studies documented their occurrence in cases without prior or COVID-19-related brain damage. The evolution of cognitive deficits in the latter population and their relationship to the post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome are poorly understood. We report the outcome at 12 months after severe COVID-19 involving an intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation in six (five Caucasian and one Asian) patients (age range: 53-71 years, mean age 61.7 ± 6.5 years) without history of prior brain dysfunction and without stroke and/or cardiac arrest during or after COVID-19. All patients reported pervading mental and physical fatigue as well as numerous multidomain complaints, which impacted everyday life. Individual patients described mental fatigability, apathy, and/or anxiety. Standardized neuropsychological tests revealed isolated symptoms of cognitive dysfunction or performance at the lower limit of the norm in the attentional, executive, and/or working memory domains in four of the six patients. Somatic scales documented dyspnoea, muscle weakness, olfactory disorder, and/or minor sleep problems in some, but not all, patients. Fatigue, fatigability, multidomain complaints, cognitive difficulties, or dysfunction, as well as isolated neurobehavioral and/or psychiatric and/or somatic symptoms, tend to occur in the aftermath of severe COVID-19 and persist at 12 months, even in the absence of prior and/or COVID-19-related brain damage. This clinical situation, which impacts everyday life, calls for a detailed investigation of patients' complaints, its neural underpinning, and an elaboration of specific rehabilitation programs.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04300-6,PMC10835993,Cognitive impairment; Everyday living impact; Fatigability; Fatigue; Mental effort; Multidomain complaints; Severe COVID-19,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report the case of a 30 year-old male patient who presented with total insomnia followed by episodes of psychomotor restlessness resembling anxiety attacks. Twenty days later, he developed refractory convulsive status epilepticus with admission to Intensive Care Unit. He progressed to a state of reduced alertness and responsiveness, presenting periods of agitation with abnormal dyskinetic movements, periods of autonomic instability and central hypoventilation. Workup revealed antibodies against N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Immunotherapy treatment led to a very significant improvement with the patient presenting only slight frontal lobe dysfunction after one year of recovery. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis first presenting with total insomnia. Our aim is to alert that anti-NMDAR encephalitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of FI, especially in sporadic cases. Distinguishing the two conditions is very important as, contrarily to the fatal disclosure of FI, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is potentially reversible with adequate treatment even after severe and prolonged disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2013.10.034,,Autoimmune encephalitis; Immunotherapy; NMDAR encephalitis; Sporadic fatal insomnia; Total insomnia; Video-EEG monitoring,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
26889799,"Can Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia also treat fatigue, pain, and mood symptoms in individuals with traumatic brain injury? - A multiple case report.","Lu, William; Krellman, Jason W; Dijkers, Marcel P",Lu,"Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often develop sleep disorders post-injury. The most common one is insomnia, which can exacerbate other post-injury symptoms, including fatigue, impaired cognition, depression, anxiety, and pain. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is a manualized treatment that effectively treats insomnia with secondary effects on cognition, mood, and pain in various populations. This paper reviews the use of CBT-I for three participants with TBI of different severities. Pre- and post-treatment assessments of insomnia, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain were conducted. Mood was further assessed at follow-up. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) scores derived from the research literature were used to establish clinically meaningful symptom improvement on self-report questionnaires. The reduction in insomnia severity scores for all three participants were not large enough to be considered a clinically significant improvement following CBT-I, although trends toward improvement were observed. However, all participants showed clinically significant reductions in anxiety at post-treatment; the effects persisted for 2 participants at follow-up. Reductions in depression symptoms were observed for 2 participants at post-treatment, and treatment effects persisted for 1 participant at follow-up. One participant endorsed clinically significant improvements in fatigue and pain severity. We conclude that CBT-I may provide secondary benefits for symptoms commonly experienced by individuals with TBI, especially mood disturbances.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-151296,,Insomnia; case study; cognitive behavioral therapy; traumatic brain injury,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Netherlands,eng
1801454,"[Illness, anxiety and the physician. An example from neurology and neurorehabilitation].","Barolin, G S",Barolin,"There are rationally treatable fears arising from the acute situation (especially in rehabilitation patients) as well as the irrational anxieties of the mainly endogenous depressive. In the condition which we have come to call ""concomitant depression"", especially in neuro-rehabilitation, we can find both types of fear and anxiety, often in the same patient with mutual overlapping. In dealing with the fears of the incurably ill patient it is essential to know the phase-related progression in order to give empathy and help in entering the further phases at the appropriate times. It is important to know the ""typical anxieties of the elderly"" and to take them into account in concomitant psychotherapy, whereby group therapy has proved to be especially useful. On the other hand, the anxieties of the doctors themselves have to be dealt with, which opens a wide field for psychodynamic supervision and the Balint-groups. Apart from psychodynamic components there should however be a distinctly defined teaching program for the health profession, as well. On the therapeutic sector, we have to mention the organismic therapies, which have a good anxiolytic quality (therapy by hypnoid states and/or relaxation). Anxiety is by no means the only known contra-productive psychodynamic factor, but it is a point of onset for a desirable integrative approach in medicine, as a counterbalance against present tendencies towards over-specialisation, which at time can be counter-productive and detrimental to the patient. To achieve this, psychotherapy has to leave its ivory tower in order to radiate into all medical disciplines. It is not our task to eradicate anxiety in its pathological overflow by therapy; but to recognize and acknowledge it as an existing human dimension, thereby preventing it from turning into counter-productive moxiousness. Essential in this process are self-reflexion, empathy, training and systematic application of therapeutic techniques in efficient combination.",{},,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Austria,ger

Imaging generally reveals a lentiform collection with diffusion restriction on diffusion weighted image. We present an interesting case in which a patient with EDA presented with three weeks of depression with suicidal ideations. The patient displayed no notable infectious signs and the imaging was suggestive of chronic subdural hematoma (SDH) rather than EDA. The patient is a 57-year-old man with past medical history significant for epilepsy and left hemiplegia secondary to remote traumatic brain injury who presented with a three-week history of depression, anxiety, and active suicidal ideation, resulting in psychiatric admission to an outside hospital. He had undergone three previous craniotomies for SDH many years ago and had no significant psychiatric history. Magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with subacute right SDH. On presentation, patient was at neurologic baseline and was afebrile with unremarkable labs. Operative findings demonstrated frank purulence in the epidural space. The patient was treated with antibiotics and both depression and suicidal ideations resolved postoperative day 5. EDA can present in atypical ways, especially in patients who have undergone previous cranial procedures. Depression is one possible atypical presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/sni.sni_52_18,PMC5926216,Depression; epidural abscess; subdural empyema; suicidal ideations,Case Reports,United States,eng

The patient was akinetic with mutism, and clonic perseveration induced in the upper limbs was evident while she was examined. Heart attack, massive stroke, or intracranial bleed were ruled out, and an electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform activity. Despite a normal CT, a magnetic resonance scan was ordered and showed bilateral acute paramedian thalamogeniculate infarction arising from occlusion of the artery of Percheron. Bilateral thalamic infarcts can cause sudden onset of akinetic mutism with clonic perseveration, which may be confused with coma and seizures due to life threatening conditions such as a massive stroke. Thorough clinical assessment and early use of MRI scanning will assist physicians with a more accurate diagnosis of older adults with this kind of presentation.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Aging clinical and experimental research,10.1007/BF03337758,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng

Antidepressants, frequently prescribed for various conditions in older adults, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, significantly contribute to this risk. The elderly are particularly vulnerable due to multiple comorbidities, cognitive decline, medication interactions, polypharmacy, and chronic kidney disease. This case underscores the critical importance of considering serotonin syndrome as a potential diagnosis in patients using serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, especially within vulnerable populations. Here, we present the case of an 89-year-old female who presented with altered mental status and a hypertensive emergency. Following a thorough examination and exclusion of alternative causes of acute encephalopathy, serotonin syndrome induced by the use of venlafaxine and oxycodone was diagnosed.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.57403,PMC11062574,altered mental state; chronic kidney insufficiency; opioid use; serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; serotonin syndrome (ss),Case Reports,United States,eng

The patient was treated with bilateral stereotactic lesions in the frontal white matter superior to the orbito-medial cortex. She had a remarkable improvement in her obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which was sustained up to 3 years of follow up. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed 18 days after surgery demonstrated an obvious reduction of metabolism in the caudate head, anterior cingulate and orbital, medial and lateral prefrontal cortices and the thalamus. At 1 year postsurgery, metabolic rate was still reduced in the anterior cingulate gyrus, caudate and thalamus compared with preoperative baseline. The patient demonstrated no long-term cognitive effects of the surgery. This case supports some of the cortical-subcortical circuit dysfunction models of OCD and argues for the further evaluation of neurosurgery for the treatment of a severe and intractable disorder.",{},,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,10.1080/0004867010060519,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Not uncommonly, it is used to control excessive respiratory secretions in palliative patients. Patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers who administer these may experience a benign, although worrying, mydriasis should they inadvertently rub their eye after handling the patch. A 46-year-old staff nurse working in a stroke ward presented with sudden-onset unilateral enlarged pupil. To rule out any intracranial pathology, the stroke team requested an urgent head computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed no abnormality. Upon ophthalmology review, nonreactive dilated left pupil was noted. Examination was otherwise unremarkable with no focal neurology findings. Following further history, she recalled applying a hyoscine patch to a patient in the morning. Two days later, her left pupil returned to normal size. This unique presentation of pharmacological mydriasis reinforces the importance of a detailed targeted history to avoid unnecessary investigations and anxiety, as well as the importance of informing patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers of this peculiar side-effect.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Seminars in ophthalmology,10.3109/08820538.2013.874484,,Anisocoria; anticholinergic; antimuscarinic; pupil dilatation; scopolamine,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
