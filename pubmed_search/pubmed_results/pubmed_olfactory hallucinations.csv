35261469,Phantosmia and dysgeusia as the first presentation of glioblastoma.,"Kokash, Atef; Carlson, John Emil",Kokash,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and has an extremely poor prognosis. It is rare for a high-grade glioma, or any brain tumor, to have an initial presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms. We present a rare case of a healthy 70-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of phantosmia and dysgeusia with magnetic resonance imaging findings of a brain mass confirmed via brain biopsy to be glioblastoma. Through a rare presentation, we aim to elucidate the importance of recognizing the association of phantosmia and dysgeusia to seizure auras and the critical need for diagnostic imaging to rule out organic causes such as infection and neoplasms.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Proceedings (Baylor University.

Three weeks after receiving the J&J COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old veteran started smelling a burning odor in the absence of an identifiable source. At presentation to the clinic, his general and neurological examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalogram were all unremarkable. The episodes persisted for nearly 2 years (21 months postvaccination). This is the only case of phantosmia reported after the use of the J&J COVID-19 vaccine and aligns with the literature that reports 1 case of phantosmia and 2 cases of hyposmia following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.

It is well differentiated with a slow-growing pattern and is composed of a combination of neoplastic ganglion and glial cells. Anaplastic ganglioglioma (AGG) is an extremely rare malignant variant of ganglioglioma, which is not included in the new WHO classification; however, the term is used to talk about gangliogliomas with data of malignancy. AGGs usually occur in children and young adults and are associated with high recurrence and mortality. The authors describe the case of a 62-year-old woman with AGG. She presented with cacosmia, vertigo, nausea, and focal-onset seizures with secondary generalization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an intra-axial lesion in the left temporal lobe. She underwent microsurgical resection guided by electrocorticography (ECoG), and a diagnosis of AGG based on microscopic morphology and immunohistochemical analysis was obtained. She was discharged a few days after surgery with subtotal resection of the lesion, no additional neurological deficit, and adequate seizure control. AGG is a very rare and poorly studied entity. It is currently a controversial term used to refer to gangliogliomas with signs of malignancy. It occurs mainly in children and young adults with temporal lobe epilepsy. Total resection is the best prognostic factor, given the unknown efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In our case, the patient was an adult woman with a subtotal resection followed by concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, obtaining a mean survival similar to that reported in the literature, so it can be thought that there is a benefit obtained with chemotherapy and radiotherapy despite having performed a subtotal resection of the lesion. Further studies are needed to establish clear diagnostic criteria for AGG, and a multicenter database of AGGs is necessary for a better understanding of the pathology and to offer the best treatment and prognosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.45862,PMC10597542,anaplastic ganglioglioma; aphasia; focal-onset seizures; ganglioglioma; glio-neural tumor,Case Reports,United States,eng

We encountered this situation in a 70-year-old woman with an unruptured aneurysm at the bifurcation of the internal carotid and posterior communicating artery. We were able to achieve epileptic control by craniotomy clipping and medial temporal lesionectomy. According to our knowledge, previous reports are limited to cases of large middle cerebral artery aneurysms compressing the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and this is apparently the first report of a case where olfactory hallucinations occurred from direct stimulation of the entorhinal cortex by an internal carotid and posterior communicating artery bifurcation aneurysm. We examined the pathophysiology underlying the development of olfactory hallucinations. We found craniotomy clipping and focal resection to be useful from the standpoint of seizure control.

Various treatments have been proposed, including wrapping, clipping with or without cortical resection, and coil embolization, but there is no consensus on the best approach. We present a case of a 69-year-old female who experienced olfactory hallucinations caused by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm and was treated with clipping without cortical resection, with a positive outcome. According to our knowledge, there has been only one report of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm presenting with olfactory hallucinations has been reported, where clipping and cortical resection were performed. This is the first report of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm with olfactory hallucinations that was effectively treated with clipping alone. There have been a few similar reports of large middle cerebral artery aneurysms, most of which are believed to be caused by entorhinal cortex compression. Although a definitive treatment protocol for this condition remains elusive, we suggest that elimination of the pulsatile compressive stress exerted on the cerebral cortex through surgical clipping or coil embolization is crucial for achieving efficacious seizure management.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_173_2023,PMC10159313,Clipping; Epilepsy; IC PC aneurysm; Olfactory hallucination; Unraptured aneurysm,Case Reports,United States,eng

Furthermore, atypical correlations between clinical phenotypes and autoantibody profiles could occur in rare cases. Here, we report the rare case of a young adult man attending due to new-onset seizures and a history of memory loss, autonomic disturbances, headache, behavioral changes, and visual and olfactory hallucinations. The patient was subjected to a complete diagnostic approach that included a comprehensive laboratory workup, neuropsychological testing, electroencephalogram, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, brain MRI, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan that revealed a functional and structural compromise of the bilateral medial temporal lobes. Together with the clinical manifestations of the patient, these findings were compatible with the diagnosis of autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE). Strikingly, further analysis of the CSF showed autoantibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. We found very few cases of the co-occurrence of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies and nonparaneoplastic ALE in the literature, especially in male patients.

Initial assessment led to the diagnosis acute on chronic liver failure exacerbated by infection leading to encephalopathy. The patient was admitted and successfully treated with antibiotics, Lactulose and Rifaximin. Gastroscopy showed varices without bleeding stigmata and Propranolol 20 mg was initiated as primary prophylaxis. Upon follow-up, the patient was clinically stable but had developed visual and auditory hallucinations which raised the suspicion that HE was not the cause.

Among the various presentation suggestive of panhypopituitarism, psychosis, and features of schizophrenia is very rarely seen. In the majority of cases, neurosurgical intervention for the excision of tumor is considered a standard treatment modality but conservative management with dopamine agonist and steroids have also been shown to provide an optimal level of care also improving the quality of level of patient. A 42-year-old Asian male presented with a history of talking to self, delusion of persecution, over talkativeness, hallucination, increased suspiciousness, and history of lost and found in the streets where he was working as a migrant worker. The patient was initially managed in line of schizophrenia with the antipsychotics drug of choice. On further assessment there was no improvement of psychiatric symptoms but they further deteriorated with additional neuropsychiatric symptoms; hence, MRI brain was carried out. Following which, the diagnosis of pituitary macroadenoma was confirmed and further more hormonal analysis was done, which showed findings suggestive of panhypopituitarism. The patient was then managed conservatively with dopamine agonist and steroids, which showed rapid improvement of psychiatric symptoms with a massive reduction in the size of the pituitary macroadenoma. With the incidence of 100 per million cases pituitary adenomas are considered locally invading with the characteristic compression of the surrounding structure, presenting as visual hallucinations, olfactory hallucinations, episodes of losing time, apathy, and features suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and symptoms secondary to hormonal imbalance such as hypothyroidism. Psychiatric symptomatic presentations are considered a very rare presentation in cases of pituitary macroadenoma. Also, psychiatric features and symptoms of psychosis are associated with prolcatinomas through idiopathic mechanism and the basic casualty has not been established. Surgical intervention such as trans-sphenoidal resection of the mass can be undertaken in case where mass effects is present but long-term remission and prognosis is found not to be fruitful. Conservative treatment with dopamine agonist such as cabergoline and steroids also plays a meaningful role in abrupt management in such cases. Pituitary macroadenoma presenting as a patient of schizophrenia is noted very rarely in medical literature; hence, investigations in view of neurosurgical diagnosis in cases presenting as psychosis should be considered for ideal holistic management. Conservative management can also be a breakthrough treatment modality in complete recovery of pituitary macroadenoma.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),10.1097/MS9.0000000000001413,PMC10718332,case report; pituitary macroadenoma; prolactinoma; schizophrenia,Case Reports,England,eng

Breakthrough mania secondary to brain neoplasm in a bipolar patient stabilized on medication is an extremely rare phenomena which has not been previously reported. The clinical course of a bipolar subject stabilized on valproate who developed mania secondary to a right temporal lobe astrocytoma is described. Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), baseline electroencephalogram (EEG), and neuropsychiatric evaluations were used to examine the relationship between the patient's brain mass and behavioral disturbances. Symptoms were those that accompanied prior episodes of mania. In addition, signs of temporal lobe dysfunction were evident including periods of detachment, déjà vu experiences, and olfactory hallucinations. In the context of mania, depersonalization was initially attributed to bipolar symptoms. Only several months later, when olfactory hallucinations and alterations in consciousness became evident, was a temporal lobe lesion suspected. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities responded to a combination of surgical intervention, radiation therapy, and topiramate, however the tumor was advanced and invasive at diagnosis resulting in a poor prognosis.

Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) is a secondary immunological form associated with increased thyroid antibodies, such as antithyroid peroxidase antibodies and shows a good response to corticosteroids. We present the case of a 41-year-old woman suffering from a schizophreniform syndrome. Starting at the age of 35, she developed psychotic exacerbations with formal thought disorder, acoustic hallucinations, cenesthopathic experiences, and loss of ego boundaries. At the same time, she began to suffer from chronic sexual delusions and olfactory hallucinations, which did not respond to neuroleptic medication. Her levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were slightly increased, and the blood-brain barrier was disturbed. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed intermittent generalized slowing, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) depicted mild temporolateral atrophy. High-dose corticosteroid treatment led to convincing improvement of attentional performance and the disappearance of delusions and olfactory hallucinations. SREAT can mimic typical symptoms of schizophreniform syndromes. The increased titer of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in combination with the EEG slowing, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and the cMRI alterations were the basis for suspecting an immunological cause in our patient. Chronic delusions, olfactory hallucinations, and cognitive deficits were successfully treated with corticosteroids. The occurrence of secondary immunological forms of schizophreniform syndromes demonstrates the need for innovative immunosuppressive treatment options.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00064,PMC5399039,Hashimoto encephalopathy; corticosteroids; schizophrenia; steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis; thyroid peroxidase; thyroiditis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
