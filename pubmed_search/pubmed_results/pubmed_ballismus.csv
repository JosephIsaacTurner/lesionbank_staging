34248493,Non-ketotic Hyperglycemia Chorea-Ballismus and Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Dong, Mingming; E, Jian-Yu; Zhang, Liyang; Teng, Weiyu; Tian, Li",Dong,"Non-ketotic hyperglycemia chorea-ballismus (NKH-CB) is a rare metabolical syndrome secondary to the hyperglycemic condition, which is characterized by a triad of acute or subacute hemichorea-hemiballismus, hyperglycemic state, and unique abnormalities limited to the striatum on neuroimaging. Several related case studies on this disorder have been reported previously, but NKH-CB had never been associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Herein, we report an uncommon case of NKH-CB and ICH that occurred simultaneously in one patient, which provides a challenge for clinicians in making a correct diagnosis. An 88-year-old woman with a long-term history of poor-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, who presented with a sudden-onset headache, restlessness, severe bilateral choreiform and ballistic movements, elevated levels of glucose and osmolality in the serum, an increased white blood cell count, and two-type hyperdense signs on CT imaging, was finally diagnosed with NKH-CB and ICH. Despite administrated active treatments, the patient's clinical status did not improve and ultimately passed away. This case is reported to remind clinicians to consider the possibility of NKH-CB when patients present sudden-onset choreiform and ballistic movements. It is also the first entity with two-type hyperdense signs on CT imaging simultaneously, which helps us distinguish NKH-CB from ICH more intuitively.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Frontiers in neuroscience,10.3389/fnins.2021.690761,PMC8260933,case report; diabetic striatopathy; differential diagnosis; hyperdense signs on neuroimaging; intracerebral hemorrhage; metabolical syndrome; non-ketotic hyperglycemia chorea-ballismus,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
38050508,Acute Caudate Nucleus Stroke Presenting As Hemiballismus.,"Babici, Denis; Mohamed, Ali A; Mattner, Olivia; Demiraj, Francis; Hammond, Thomas",Babici,"Hemiballismus is defined as irregular, involuntary, large-amplitude flinging movements by the limbs, confined to one side of the body. Hemichorea refers to a state of excessive and irregularly timed, non-repetitive and randomly distributed, spontaneous, involuntary, and abrupt movements. It is widely believed that hemiballismus and chorea are suggestive of a lesion to the basal ganglia and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, there are other etiologies that may influence the clinical presentation. Patients may present with certain common clinical features corresponding to the affected area of the brain. For example, infarctions of the motor cortex present with hemiplegia or paralysis of one side of the body. Similarly, infarctions involving the language areas of the brain present with aphasia and are detrimental to speech production or comprehension and the ability to read and write. Typically, acute-onset hemichorea is suggestive of a lesion in the STN. Herein, we present a rare case of acute hemiballismus and hemichorea following infarction of the left caudate nucleus, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) imaging modalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48209,PMC10693717,basal ganglia infarction; basal ganglia stroke; chorea and hemiballismus; haloperidol; subthalamic nucleus,Case Reports,United States,eng
26942135,Cortical Hemiballism: A Case of Hemiballismus Associated with Parietal Lobe Infarct.,"Shrestha, Pragya; Adhikari, Janak; Poudel, Dilli; Pathak, Ranjan; Karmacharya, Paras",Shrestha,"Hemiballismus is characterized by involuntary, irregular, large amplitude, and violent flinging movements of limbs. Stroke (middle and posterior cerebral artery) remains the most common etiology with 2/3 being lacunar. Lesions outside the substantia niagra (STN) can cause hemiballism, and only a minority by STN lesions, unlike the classical belief. Compared to those arising from STN, cortical hemiballismus is usually less severe with a good prognosis. A 61-year-old man presented with sudden onset involuntary flinging movements of his right upper extremity accompanied by numbness and tingling. Past medical history was significant for stroke 2 years back with no residual deficits. Vitals signs were blood pressure of 165/84 mm Hg, and heart rate - 82 beats/min. Irregular, arrhythmic, jerky flinging movement, and decreased sensation to light touch in right upper extremity was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed acute posterior left parietal lobe infarction. He was treated with aspirin and atorvastatin. Thrombolytic therapy was offered but declined. The movements resolved spontaneously over the next 2 days. No further episodes occurred at 3-month follow-up. Lesions affecting various areas outside the STN can cause hemiballism and usually carries a good prognosis with spontaneous resolution. Acute thrombolytic therapy may be considered on an individual basis. Treatment with antipsychotics can be useful for severe and recurring symptoms.",{},,North American journal of medical sciences,10.4103/1947-2714.172850,PMC4755084,Antipsychotics; hemiballism; hemiballismus; infarction; parietal lobe; stroke; subthalamic,Case Reports,India,eng

The movements had lasted two minutes and the deviation resolved spontaneously after 30 minutes. She had a history of similar movements five days earlier. During her stay in the emergency center, she experienced the same movements three times. A CT scan without contrast showed a small lesion in the left putamen. Four vessel color Doppler sonography showed a small atheroma plaque in the proximal part of the left internal carotid artery with stenosis less than ten percent. The repeated CT scans revealed progression of the hypodense lesion and the patient developed hemiparesis. In this case, ballismus movements were a cardinal sign for a future stroke and her problem can be considered a recurrent transient ischemic attack or a stroke in evolution.",{},,Annals of Saudi medicine,10.5144/0256-4947.2012.01.7.1515,PMC6078588,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Saudi Arabia,eng
36762000,Hypoglycemic Encephalopathy Manifesting with Cortical Hemichorea-Hemiballismus Syndrome: A Case Report.,"Pasini, Francesco; Karantzoulis, Aristotelis; Fanella, Gaia; Brovelli, Francesco; Iacobucci, Davide; Aprea, Vittoria; Storti, Benedetta; Santangelo, Francesco; Canonico, Francesco; Remida, Paolo; Ferrarese, Carlo; Brighina, Laura",Pasini,"Hyper-/hypoglycemic states are rare but well-established causes of hyperkinetic movements, including chorea and ballismus, usually associated with brain lesions in the basal ganglia. We report a case of hemichorea-hemiballismus (HCHB) syndrome that developed after a severe hypoglycemic episode in a 71-year-old man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Uncommonly, brain MRI showed contralateral cortical-subcortical T2 and T2-FLAIR-hyperintense frontoparietal lesions, with cingulate gyrus involved, while the basal ganglia were unaffected. In patients with hypoglycemic encephalopathy associated with cortical lesions, the long-term prognosis is usually poor. Nevertheless, in our patient, the dyskinesias and the cerebral lesions progressively regressed by achieving good glycemic control. After four and 12 months, the patient's neurological examination was normal. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of hypoglycemic etiology of cortical HCHB syndrome, supporting recent theories that cortical circuitries may independently contribute to the pathogenesis of chorea and ballismus. This is also the first report of cingulate gyrus involvement in hypoglycemic encephalopathy. Finally, this case may indicate that a subset of patients with cortical lesions due to hypoglycemia could present a good clinical outcome, likely depending on the size of the lesions and the duration and severity of the hypoglycemic episode.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000528880,PMC9906039,Hemiballismus; Hemichorea; Hemichorea-hemiballismus syndrome; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic encephalopathy,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

In this paper, we present two patients, who had involuntary movements and were diagnosed as having ballismus-chorea associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia. While one of the patients was not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, the other one did not administer insulin therapy for a long time which was prescribed. The patients were investigated by cranial imaging and biochemical tests. The symptoms improved in one of them within hours, however, it took days to improve for the other one. This clinical situation, which is thought to be caused by hyperglycemia, cerebral ischemia and failure of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and which probably improves with regulation of blood glucose levels, should be kept in mind by emergency physicians, because it can be the first presentation of type 2 diabetes mellitus.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Noro psikiyatri arsivi,10.4274/npa.y6468,PMC5363433,Ballismus; Chorea; Nonketotic hyperglycemia,Case Reports,Turkey,eng
38046771,Driving Under the Influence: An Unusual Case of Basal Ganglia Stroke Misdiagnosed as Intoxication.,"Butt, Faiza; Durrani, Kulsoom; Khan, Muhammad N; Waheed, Abdul",Butt,"Traditionally, strokes are characterized by negative symptoms, including contralateral hemiparesis, facial paralysis, and sensory loss in the upper face and upper extremities. Strokes rarely cause movement disorders such as ballismus, a severe chorea characterized by brief, sudden dance-like movements. Early identification of non-traditional stroke symptoms and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease is vital in providing timely treatment and improving patient outcomes. Our case highlights an uncommon complication of stroke and the need to use advanced imaging modalities, including MRI, to identify brain lesions when other testing is negative. This report adds to the body of literature highlighting ballismus, a rare presentation of stroke, and the lessons learned from managing this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48097,PMC10691168,ballismus; hemiballismus; negative symptoms; positive symptoms; residual hemiparesis; stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

Chorea and ballismus are hyperkinetic movements affecting the side contralateral to the striatal hyperintensity on imaging. This presentation is a manifestation of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus most commonly reported in elderly eastern Asian women. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it is reversible with optimal glycemic control. The patient described in this case is a Caucasian male in his mid-50s who presented to the emergency department with speech disturbance. Only after a detailed neurologic examination and MRI head in the setting of non-ketotic hyperglycemia the diagnosis of non-ketotic hyperglycemia hemichorea-hemiballismus was deduced.

Besides the hyperkinesias, two patients had parkinsonism, and one had cerebral Whipple's disease. In two, the movement disorder preceded other evidence of AIDS; in three others, the diagnosis of AIDS was not considered until there was a movement disorder.

Of these 33 cases, 4 cases were examined by the authors and 29 cases were obtained from the literature. Cerebrovascular disease was present in 27 cases and the localization of the lesion was examined with CT. Of these 10 cases had lesions in the subthalamus, while 17 cases had lesions outside the subthalamus. In 6 cases, the location of the lesion was not recognized on CT. In cases with lesions outside the subthalamus, 11 cases had lesions in the putamen, 10 cases had lesions in the caudate. Therefore the lesion were largely located in the striatum. Typical hemiballismus was seen in 16 cases. In this group, 6 cases had lesions in the subthalamus, 5 cases had lesions in the putamen, and 3 cases had lesions in the caudate. Hemiballismus accompanied by hemichorea was seen in 17 cases. In this group, while 9 cases had hemichorea with ballismus, and 5 out of 9 cases had lesions in the caudate, 4 cases had lesions in the putamen. Thus, all lesions were located in the striatum. Eight out of 17 cases had hemiballismus with chorea. In these 8 cases, 4 cases had lesions in the subthalamus, these were 2 cases in the putamen, and 2 cases had lesions in the caudate. When all cases were examined in terms of clinical manifestations, 10 cases were considered to have lesions in the caudate and 7 out of 10 cases involved chorea.

23185174,Pure hemi-chorea resulting from an acute phase of contralateral thalamic lacunar infarction: a case report.,"Takahashi, Teruyuki; Kanamori, Hideaki; Shigehara, Rihiro; Takahashi, Sachiko Nonaka; Tamura, Masato; Takasu, Toshiaki; Murakami, Marohito",Takahashi,"Thalamic lesions give rise to a variety of clinical syndromes such as pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, and rarely involuntary movements including chorea. Generally and classically, lacunar infarction in the subthalamic nucleus has been regarded as the lesion mainly responsible for hemi-chorea and hemi-ballismus, on the basis of previous anatomical studies. This report describes the case of an 81-year-old man who developed sudden-onset pure hemi-chorea in the right limbs resulting from an acute phase of left thalamic lacunar infarction detected on a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) in an MRI study. The patient had no other neurological symptoms such as ataxic hemiparesis and sensory disturbance. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study using the (99m)Tc-ECD Patlak plot method demonstrated significant perfusional asymmetry between the right and left thalami (p = 0.0035), consistent with the left thalamic lesion on DWI. It is speculated that this perfusional asymmetry, in particular the hypoperfusion in the left thalamus, detected by SPECT might play the most important role in the contralateral pure hemi-chorea as a rare neurological manifestation in this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000345227,PMC3506042,DWI; Diffusion-weighted image; Pure hemi-chorea; SPECT; Single-photon emission computed tomography; Thalamic lacunar infarction,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng
11448303,Ballistic-choreic movements as the presenting feature of renal cancer.,"Kujawa, K A; Niemi, V R; Tomasi, M A; Mayer, N W; Cochran, E; Goetz, C G",Kujawa,"The paraneoplastic syndromes can involve multiple areas of the central nervous system and result in a variety of neurological symptoms. To our knowledge, severe, rapidly progressive, and drug-resistant ballistic-choreic movements have not been previously described as the presenting feature of renal cell carcinoma. A previously healthy 55-year-old man developed limb ballismus and involuntary choreic movements of his face over several weeks. Extensive laboratory, diagnostic, and radiographic studies failed to reveal a cause, until an abnormality on a chest x-ray film prompted a search for a primary neoplasm and a final diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. High doses of medications traditionally used to treat choreic disorders had no effect on the abnormal movements. A biopsy specimen of the basal ganglia showed focal encephalitic changes but no malignant neoplasm. Whereas prior cases of paraneoplastic syndromes with chorea have been reported in other forms of cancer, our case was significant because, to our knowledge, renal cell carcinoma has not been previously reported in association with this syndrome. Furthermore, the chorea was categorically resistant to pharmacological treatment, and the movement disorder was the initial and only focal neurological feature of the primary illness.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.58.7.1133,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Such patients usually receive symptomatic therapy with limited effect. We report the case of an acute stroke patient with HB who was successfully treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension and ischemic coronary heart disease presented in the emergency room 85 minutes after sudden onset of involuntary coarse flinging movements of the left arm and leg. Neurological investigation revealed oromandibular dyskinesia; left blepharospasm; dyskinetic movements of the head and neck; dysarthria; and forceful, jerky, irregular, flinging, large-amplitude involuntary movements involving his left arm and left leg. Initial brain computed tomography showed only mild confluent periventricular hypodensities in the vicinity of the frontal horns. The calculated National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 1, for dysarthria. The sudden onset of HB, however, suggested an acute stroke and we decided to treat the patient with intravenous rtPA. Thrombolytic therapy with rtPA began 200 minutes after symptom onset, and after the patient's increased arterial blood pressure was resolved. Follow-up examination performed 12 hours after therapy revealed only mild dysarthria; mild ataxia of the left arm, and ataxic gait. Delayed brain computed tomography did not indicate recent ischemia, although a fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging sequence revealed high signal intensity lesions in the vicinity of the right putamen and left cerebellar hemisphere. After 1 month, a follow-up examination revealed only mild dysarthria and mild ataxia of the left arm. Acute stroke patients with low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, including patients with HB, should be considered as candidates for thrombolytic treatment.",{},,The neurologist,10.1097/NRL.0b013e31821a25c4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A few days earlier he had undergone general anesthesia prior to a dental procedure. There was trouble in waking the patient afterwards. The movements lasted a few days. MRI of the brain revealed ischemic lesions areas in T2-weighted images localized in the region of globus pallidus bilaterally. EEG was abnormal, and showed slowed background activity with slow waves in left temporal lobe. He was treated with haloperidol, clonazepam and vasoactive medications. In spite of administered treatment, hemiballic movements reappeared occasionally. Due to increased frequency of the movements the patient was hospitalized again two years later.

24421947,Classic neuroimaging findings of nonketotic hyperglycemia on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging with absence of typical movement disorder symptoms (hemichorea-hemiballism).,"Hansford, Barry G; Albert, Dara; Yang, Edward",Hansford,"While there are broad differential diagnoses for either the clinical finding of hemichorea-hemiballism or the imaging finding of lateralizing/asymmetric basal ganglia lesions (hyperdense on computed tomography, hyperintense on T1 magnetic resonance imaging), the presence of both findings is highly suggestive of nonketotic hyperglycemia. We present an unusual case of a patient with vague stroke-like complaints and imaging findings notable for lateralizing basal ganglia lesions. Laboratory analysis revealed nonketotic hyperglycemia and neurologic exam failed to elicit any findings of movement disorder. As far as we know, this is the first published case of a patient with typical neuroimaging manifestations of nonketotic hyperglycemia without associated hemichorea-hemiballism (a disorder of abnormal movements comprised of more proximal, higher amplitude movements-ballismus and lower amplitude, more distal movements-chorea).
