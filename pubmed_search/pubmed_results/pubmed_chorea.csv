NIHSS was 0/42. Neurological examination revealed chorea-like movements over the left limbs, especially the foot. No other neurological signs were present. CT perfusion showed right cortical hypoperfusion due to right M2 occlusion, basal-ganglia perfusion was normal. Brain MRI revealed a small focus of restricted diffusion in the right insula, sparing basal ganglia. Based on the neuroimaging features and clinical correlation, despite the NIHSS score, we decided to treat the patient with alteplase, after iv-thrombolysis hyperkinetic movements ceased completely. Brain-MRI performed 72 h after symptom onset confirmed a confined insular ischemic lesion without the involvement of deep gray matter structures. Hyperkinetic movement disorders, such as hemichorea hemiballismus, are rare presentations of stroke, basal ganglia are mainly involved even if the insular cortex has been described too. Clinical decision on whether to treat ischemic stroke does not include movement disorders.

24008760,Cortical hemichorea-hemiballism.,"Hwang, Kyoung Jin; Hong, Il Ki; Ahn, Tae-Beom; Yi, Sang Hun; Lee, Dokyung; Kim, Deog Yoon",Hwang,"Hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) was infrequently related to cortical lesions such as tumor or infarction. Although functional derangement of the basal ganglia (BG) or the thalamus (Th) was suggested, pathomechanism of HCHB secondary to cortical lesions remains uncertain. We recruited the patients with HCHB secondary to cerebrovascular diseases, excluding other causes such as hyperglycemia. All the patients were studied with brain magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Those with only cortical abnormalities in neuroimaging studies were sorted out as the cases of cortical HCHB. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis of SPECT was performed to investigate the pathomechanism of cortical HCHB. Ten patients (three males and seven females) were included in our study. Six patients had acute BG lesions with SPECT abnormalities, and one had old BG lesions with abnormal SPECT. Three patients were classified as cortical HCHB with lesions only in the frontal and parietal cortices in MRI and SPECT. SPM analysis revealed additional hypoperfusion in frontal areas, leaving BG and Th free of any perfusion abnormalities. Although cortical HCHB was strictly defined by MRI and SPECT, cortical HCHB was not uncommon (30 %). Further analysis showed intertwined networks among the frontal and parietal lobes for cortical HCHB. Cortical dysfunction is important in the pathogenesis of cortical HCHB even without significant involvement of BG and Th.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-013-7096-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A 58-year-old male patient who suffers from untreated high blood pressure, type II obesity, smokes 6 packs of cigarettes per year and has a moderate intake of alcohol is presented. The patient's recent history began three days before he appeared at the Emergency Department. His symptoms were ceaseless, involuntary movements in his left arm and foot during day and night with no restriction of voluntary movements. Physical examination and laboratory tests revealed no other findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hyperintensity in the right posterolateral thalamic region consistent with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Symptomatic therapy was indicated and his underlying conditions were addressed.

Hemichorea refers to a state of excessive and irregularly timed, non-repetitive and randomly distributed, spontaneous, involuntary, and abrupt movements. It is widely believed that hemiballismus and chorea are suggestive of a lesion to the basal ganglia and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, there are other etiologies that may influence the clinical presentation. Patients may present with certain common clinical features corresponding to the affected area of the brain. For example, infarctions of the motor cortex present with hemiplegia or paralysis of one side of the body. Similarly, infarctions involving the language areas of the brain present with aphasia and are detrimental to speech production or comprehension and the ability to read and write. Typically, acute-onset hemichorea is suggestive of a lesion in the STN. Herein, we present a rare case of acute hemiballismus and hemichorea following infarction of the left caudate nucleus, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) imaging modalities.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.48209,PMC10693717,basal ganglia infarction; basal ganglia stroke; chorea and hemiballismus; haloperidol; subthalamic nucleus,Case Reports,United States,eng

The pathophysiology is not fully elucidated but may involve hyperviscosity, ischemia, and alterations in basal ganglia neurotransmitters. We present a case of a 64-year-old Asian female patient with longstanding poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus who developed abrupt-onset right-sided hemichorea-hemiballismus. Laboratory results showed hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis. Neuroimaging revealed left putaminal hyperdensity on computed tomography and T1 hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging. With insulin therapy and tetrabenazine, her movements improved but persisted at 1-month follow-up. This case illustrates the typical features of diabetic striatopathy, including acute choreiform movements contralateral to neuroimaging abnormalities in the setting of nonketotic hyperglycemia. While neuroleptics may provide symptomatic relief, prompt glycemic control is critical given the risk of recurrence despite imaging normalization. Diabetic striatopathy should be recognized as a rare disorder that can occur with poorly controlled diabetes. Further study of its pathophysiological mechanisms is needed to better guide management. Maintaining tight glycemic control is essential to prevent recurrence of this debilitating movement disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-023-04332-y,PMC10929169,Acute choreiform movements; Diabetic striatopathy; Hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballismus; Neurotransmitter alterations; Nonketotic hyperglycemia; Putaminal hyperdensity; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

A 72-year-old woman presented with complaints of involuntary movements of the muscles of the left side of the face and mild weakness of the right limbs. Her symptoms had started suddenly 1 d earlier. After admission to the hospital, the involuntary movements spread to involve the left limbs also. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left thalamic infarction.

She is presently symptom free and on treatment for prevention of secondary stroke. We review the literature on the occurrence of ipsilateral hemichorea following thalamic infarction and discuss the possible pathomechanisms of this unusual presentation.

Both patients were treated at an inpatient rehabilitation center and made a significant recovery in both function and activities of daily living. Although hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome has known pharmacological treatments, little has been reported on the effectiveness of acute rehabilitation on managing and treating this syndrome. The first case involves a 44-year-old Hispanic male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anxiety, and depression who presented with continuous, uncontrollable, unilateral movements 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed lesions in the basal ganglia, confirming the diagnosis of hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome. The patient was started on antipsychotic medications and antihyperglycemic medications controlling glucose levels, but continued to have hemiballismus symptoms. The second case involves a 78-year-old Haitian female with past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension who presented with weakness and continuous, involuntary movements in her upper and lower extremities 1 month following a hospital admission for hyperglycemia and encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were positive for bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia, establishing a diagnosis of hemiballismus-hemichorea syndrome. After a 2-week stay at an acute rehabilitation center, both patients made a significant recovery in function and activities of daily living.

Uncommonly, brain MRI showed contralateral cortical-subcortical T2 and T2-FLAIR-hyperintense frontoparietal lesions, with cingulate gyrus involved, while the basal ganglia were unaffected. In patients with hypoglycemic encephalopathy associated with cortical lesions, the long-term prognosis is usually poor. Nevertheless, in our patient, the dyskinesias and the cerebral lesions progressively regressed by achieving good glycemic control.

We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL. The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL. No treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psychotropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT.

Herein, we report a 68-year-old man with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who experienced the progressive involuntary movement of the right upper and lower limbs for 10 days. We initially considered this patient as an AIS with hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia and adjacent area because his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images, as well as slight T1-hyperintensity around T1-hypointensity. However, his symptoms worsen persistently, which was inconsistent with neuroimaging findings. Further computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an extensive hyper-density and focal low-density in the left striatum, suggesting the diagnosis of DS and AIS. His symptoms were in complete remission after 2 months of glucose control. However, striatal hyperintensity on T1 images was significantly increased compared to the initial images, which disappeared 18 months later. Additionally, DWI hyperintensity on infarction lesions disappeared, while softening lesions and gliosis were observed on the follow-up MRI images. Therefore, we finally diagnosed the patient as DS complicated with AIS. This report highlights that DS and AIS could occur simultaneously in the striatum after hyperglycemia, which is easily misdiagnosed as AIS with hemorrhage and requires clinicians to pay more attention to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in neuroscience,10.3389/fnins.2022.877479,PMC9315246,acute ischemic stroke; chorea; diabetic striatopathy; hyperglycemia; involuntary movement,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

A 32-year-old man visited the emergency room due to dysarthria and right hemiparesis that occurred approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes before the visit. A brain magnetic resonance image confirmed a diffusion restriction lesion in the left pons. The patient was initially diagnosed with acute infarction at the left pons and began to receive medical treatment with an antiplatelet agent and statin with admission. Approximately 14 hours after the onset of the initial stroke symptoms, the patient complained of involuntary movement in the right arm for the first time. Intermittent, irregular involuntary movements were observed in the distal part of the right arm. This symptom was unpredictable and random, and a similar symptom was not observed in other parts of the patient's body. Clinically, post-stroke monochorea was suspected. The symptom improved from day 5 without specific medical treatment for chorea. The monochorea caused by the pontine lesion in this case was triggered by the direct lesions of the corticospinal tract, and its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. However, abnormal movements can occur due to inadequate downstream activation or inhibition of the corticospinal tract, which is induced by functional abnormalities of the motor cortex. This case suggests that further investigation is needed on the mechanisms of direct corticospinal tract lesions for chorea.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000032660,PMC9857559,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In this fast-paced environment, the primary focus is appropriate triage, rapid stabilization, diagnosis, and acute intervention for life-threatening conditions such as cerebral vascular accident (CVA). However, this approach may result in subtle or atypical neurologic signs and symptoms being overlooked. Often, these oversights are innocuous in terms of their influence on overall patient outcomes.

These unusual manifestations may be fleeting as they often either resolve with intervention or are overshadowed by progressive clinical decline. If such findings are recognized, they can at a minimum provide fascinating insights into neuroanatomic function. At a maximum, early recognition can influence immediate treatments and long-term outcomes. We report three ED patient presentations that shed light on functional neuroanatomical pathways and, in one case, significantly affected a patient's immediate algorithmic care. Two such cases involved acute middle cerebral artery distribution ischemic strokes, which typically present with focal contralateral sensorimotor and potential language deficits. Such events less commonly initially present with involuntary motor movements (dyskinesias). Failure to recognize these less common ictal signs may delay appropriate ED intervention or yield etiologic misdiagnoses. A third case involved a loss of consciousness ictal event secondary to a frontotemporal lobe tumor. This case presented with aphasic stroke-like symptoms along with new acute orofacial dyskinesias.

Patient 1: An 82-year-old woman presented with a 1-mo history of involuntary movement of the left extremity, which was consistent with hemichorea. Her diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed an acute ischemic stroke that predominantly affected the right temporal cortex, and magnetic resonance angiography of the head showed significant stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment with 2.5 mg of olanzapine per day was initiated. When she was discharged from the hospital, her symptoms appeared to have improved compared with those previously observed. Twenty-seven days after the first admission, she was readmitted due to acute ischemic stroke. Computed tomography perfusion showed marked hypoperfusion in the right MCA territory. An emergency transfemoral cerebral angiogram was performed and showed severe stenosis in the M1 segment of the right MCA. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was successfully performed, abnormal movements or other neurologic problems did not occur. Patient 2: A 76-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a 7-d history of right-upper-sided involuntary movements.

31890704,Neuroradiological Evolution of Glycaemic Hemichorea-Hemiballism and the Possible Role of Brain Hypoperfusion.,"Marinelli, Lucio; Maggi, Davide; Trompetto, Carlo; Renzetti, Paolo",Marinelli,"Lateralized involuntary movements consistent with hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear following the development of contralateral haemorrhagic or ischaemic lesions of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). This condition is called vascular HCHB, but the same symptoms can be caused by a completely different striatal lesion. Glycaemic HCHB may occur in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia: basal ganglia hyperdensity is seen on brain CT, while increased T1 signal intensity and reduced susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and gradient-echo sequences (T2*-GRE) are detected on MRI. An 83-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia was admitted for ischaemic stroke presenting with dysarthria and mild left hemiparesis. No involuntary movements were reported at admission. The emergent brain CT scan was negative for vascular acute lesions, while a mild bilateral hyperdensity of the striata was detectable. Involuntary movements on the left side of the body, consistent with HCHB, appeared 27 days later. The alterations on brain CT completely disappeared after 3 months. On brain MRI, the T1 signal alterations resolved after 10 months, while SWI and T2*-GRE sequences showed persisting alterations after 2 years. Detailed brain imaging demonstrated evolution of striatal alterations of glycaemic HCHB before the appearance of involuntary movements and during the following 2 years. The association between ischaemic stroke and glycaemic HCHB favours the hypothesis that chronic hyperglycaemia more likely determines striatal alterations and the clinical picture of HCHB when vascular hypoperfusion also occurs. Hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia accompanied by typical neuroradiological features consisting of striatal alterations detectable on brain CT and MRI, often bilaterally.Unusually, striatal alterations can be detected before the appearance of involuntary movements and are fully reversible on brain CT and T1-MRI sequences.Brain hypoperfusion may facilitate the appearance of typical HCHB in patients with chronic hyperglycaemia.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,10.12890/2019_001257,PMC6886634,Hemichorea; athetosis; hemiballism; hyperglycemia; hypoperfusion,Case Reports,Italy,eng

It is associated with chorea and other movement disorders. Seizures are still rare. Various autoantibodies are associated with the development of basal ganglia encephalitis. These autoantibodies are against dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Another paraneoplastic antibody known as anti-recoverin antibodies (Abs) is also associated with basal ganglia encephalitis. We report a case of a 45-year-old male who presented in this hospital with a history of cognitive dysfunction and slowness of activities for eight days and faciobrachial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed lesions in the putamen and caudate nucleus. Infection and antibody screening were negative.

Neurological deficits following surgical procedures for epilepsy are not uncommon, but most are relatively minor and transient. The authors investigated the neuroimaging patterns of cerebral tissue insults in patients suffering neurological deficits directly related to procedures performed to evaluate and treat intractable epilepsy. They attempted to discern potential secondary vascular insults from the not unexpected tissue loss that can be associated with various epilepsy procedures. The authors prospectively assessed 7 consecutive patients who underwent either the invasive electrocortigraphic monitoring or surgical resection of epileptic foci. All had some degree of neurological deficit postoperatively. The authors evaluated for tissue injury type with postoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance brain imaging. They also review pertinent medical literature addressing potential complications of epilepsy surgery. Three patients had primarily ischemic tissue injuries, 2 had tissue loss with minor bleeding, and 1 transient deficit appeared to reflect the amount of tissue removed. Another patient had choreiform movements and gait ataxia 1 week after the procedure, but no follow-up neuroimaging was available. The primary ischemic insults appeared to be related to vascular traction or compression or possibly vasospasm. The tissue loss/hemorrhagic insults were presumably related to tissue loss, with seepage of blood or bleeding from a resected cavernous hemangioma. No patients died, but 1 was left with a persistent, moderately severe neurological deficit. It is important to distinguish the not unexpected neurological deficits associated with inadvertent trauma to normal brain tissue during procedures associated with epilepsy surgery from vascular insults. Postoperative neuroimaging can be useful in this endeavor.",{},,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, in some cases, pneumocephalus presents with headache, encephalopathy, or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. Here, we present a case of iatrogenic tension pneumocephalus following endoscopic sinus surgery, presenting as abnormal involuntary movements resembling a movement disorder with choreiform movements. A 67-year-old previously healthy male presented with new onset chorea and dystonia associated with headache, encephalopathy, and postural instability 4 days after undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. Computed tomography showed prominent intraventricular pneumocephalus causing enlargement of the anterior horns of both lateral ventricles with lateral displacement of the basal ganglia nuclei and a bony defect in the skull base. Neurosurgical correction of the cranial defect provided complete symptomatic resolution. Pneumocephalus as a result of an iatrogenic injury of the skull base manifesting as an acute movement disorder is a rare complication of a nasal sinus procedure. We speculate that compression of the caudate nucleus and striatum resulted in decreased pallidothalamic inhibition and thalamocortical disinhibition leading to the development of a hyperkinetic movement disorder.

The information on the pathogenesis and treatment options for this condition is largely unknown. An 82-year-old female with no neurological deficits underwent a clipping for a giant middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. Immediately after surgery, she presented with hemichorea-hemiballismus (HC-HB) on the left side. Postoperative angiograms and single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated the hyperperfusion in the right frontal cortex and the decreased perfusion in the basal ganglia, indicating that the abrupt hemodynamic changes due to the obliteration of the giant aneurysm caused the dysfunction of the frontal cortical and subcortical pathway and the basal ganglia. Administration of tiapride hydrochloride was dramatically effective in controlling the HC-HB until the hyperperfusion resolved. Single-photon emission computed tomography obtained 8 weeks after surgery revealed that the cerebral blood flow had been normalized in the right frontal cortex. The relative hypoperfusion of the right basal ganglia was also resolved. Then tiapride hydrochloride was discontinued without a relapse of HC-HB. This case appears consistent with the theory that the connecting fibers responsible for the development of HC-HB are also located in the frontal lobe. The treatment of giant aneurysms involving the M1 portion can cause abrupt hemodynamic changes in both frontal cortex and the basal ganglia, which can potentially induce postoperative movement disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/2152-7806.157444,PMC4443400,Aneurysm; chorea; clipping; giant aneurysm; hyperperfusion; single-photon emission computed tomography,Case Reports,United States,eng

Because even the neurologic consultant may not be alert to the possibility of psychiatric symptoms alone heralding CNS pathology, the decision to augment the clinical impression with neuroradiologic or other brain imaging adjuncts (and to choose among them) may rest solely with the psychiatrist.

38064410,Resolving the Dance: A Case Study on Non-Ketotic Hyperglycemic Hemichorea-Hemiballismus in a Patient with Long-Standing Type 2 Diabetes.,"Winbush, Angelina; Mahler, Stewart; Braun, Melanie; Thapa, Kriti",Winbush,"BACKGROUND Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) is a rare complication of diabetes, which is mainly described in case reports. This condition occurs more commonly in older women and is known to be associated with T1 hyperintensity basal ganglia lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pathophysiology of non-ketotic hyperglycemic HCHB is not well defined, although a combination of regional metabolic failure and ischemia due to hyperglycemia is suspected to occur. Treatment entails tight blood glucose control, although antipsychotic medications such as risperidone may be helpful in refractory cases. CASE REPORT We describe a case of a middle-aged man with long-standing type 2 diabetes who experienced 3 weeks of progressive unilateral arm, leg, and face choreiform movements. Laboratory testing performed just prior to symptom onset was notable for a hemoglobin A1C of >15% and a serum blood glucose of 566 mg/dl. MRI revealed diffuse T1 hyperintensity in the left lentiform nucleus. Our patient's insulin regimen was adjusted, resulting in improvement in average serum glucose (A1C of 9.4%). However, his symptoms did not improve significantly. A trial of benzodiazepine was attempted, without success. When risperidone was started, the patient experienced resolution of symptoms. Recurrence of non-ketotic hyperglycemic HCHB while off risperidone has not occurred to date. CONCLUSIONS Non-ketotic hyperglycemic HCHB is a rare but important diagnosis to consider in patients with hyperglycemia and new-onset choreiform movements. Patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes may be affected, especially when glycemic control worsens. When tight blood glucose control does not resolve symptoms, a short course of antipsychotic agents may provide relief.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.941443,PMC10721340,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

An 83-year-old female patient with diabetes mellitus presenting with severe and refractory involuntary movement after hypoglycaemic therapy was referred to an outpatient neurosurgery department for further intervention. Laboratory, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) neuroimaging and physical examinations were performed. After a diagnosis of HC-HB was confirmed, the patient received hypoglycaemic therapy and haloperidol; however, there was no significant improvement. Brain MRI T1-weighted images and CT scans showed high signal intensity involving the bilateral putamen nucleus.

Although neglect has been observed following damage to a variety of brain structures, to date no reports exist of neglect phenomena arising from Huntington's Disease (HD). However, reports in the animal and human literature suggest that neglect is possible following damage to a primary site for Huntington's pathology, the basal ganglia. Here we present a patient (BG) with genetically proven HD who, in the context of the mild intellectual, executive and attentional impairments associated with the disorder, showed a remarkably severe and stable neglect for left space. MRI and electrophysiological results make it unlikely that the spatial bias could be accounted for by basic sensory loss. In addition, behavioural investigation indicated that, although BG's neglect operated in a very striking manner along body-centred co-ordinates (missing almost all information presented to her left), more general limitations in visual attention were apparent to the left-side of information presented entirely to the right of the body midline. Further evidence is presented showing that the neglect was manifest on tactile and auditory tasks as well as those presented in the visual domain. The presence of neglect in HD in this case is novel and somewhat puzzling, particularly as flourodeoyglucose positron emission tomography revealed bilateral caudate hypoperfusion. Reducing the statistical threshold on this analysis revealed a potential frontal hypometabolism that was more marked in the right than left hemisphere. However, as this was only apparent at a threshold below that normally considered acceptable (due to the resulting number of false positives), this possible account of the neglect must be viewed very cautiously.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.9.3.261.15559,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report a case of hemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) in a patient with diabetes. Clinical assessment of the patient was performed, along with laboratory tests and brain imaging. The patient was a 50-year-old man with newly detected diabetes with persistent involuntary movement of the right upper and lower limbs for few weeks. The involuntary movement was nonrhythmic, nonpatterned, purposeless, and often jerky with variable amplitude and frequency, sometimes wild and flailing in the form of hemichorea with a ballistic component (HCHB). He had a history of poor compliance to prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. At presentation, although he was hemodynamically stable, random capillary blood glucose level was 18 mmol/L and glycated hemoglobin A1 level was 15.1% (141.5 mmol/mol). Clinical examination did not reveal any focal deficit or positive Babinski sign. There was a hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia region in T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which was iso-to-hyperintense in T2-weighted image and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence. There was no restriction of diffusion on the diffusion-weighted image or blooming on gradient echo sequences, indicating absence of infarction or hemorrhage. Control of hyperglycemia resulted in disappearance of the involuntary movement within 1 month. While there are many differential diagnoses for HCHB, the clinical scenario suggests hyperglycemia as the underlying cause in this patient. This case reiterates that multiple central nervous system manifestations may be attributable to diabetes.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,AACE clinical case reports,10.1016/j.aace.2020.11.032,PMC8074690,"CNS, central nervous system; DM, diabetes mellitus; DWI, diffusion-weighted imaging; HCHB, hemichorea-hemiballism; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; diabetes; hemichorea-hemiballism; involuntary movement",Case Reports,United States,eng

It can be a significant symptom in various neurologic diseases, including metabolic, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative conditions. The neural foundation that underlies the genesis of chorea appears to be fairly diverse, even though its pathophysiology is frequently associated with the malfunctioning of inhibitory circuits within the basal ganglia. Movement disorders such as tremors, myoclonus, ataxia, chorea, and Parkinsonism may arise due to renal dysfunction or complications from management like renal transplant and hemodialysis. Uremic encephalopathy is a rare but potentially life-threatening neurological complication of chronic kidney disease. We present a case of a 50-year-old male with a known history of chronic kidney disease and chronic alcoholism, who exhibited abnormal movements resembling chorea upon presentation. Initially suspected as alcohol withdrawal-related chorea, further evaluation revealed concurrent rising creatinine levels, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. Hemodialysis was initiated, resulting in a significant improvement in choreoathetoid movements. This case implies the importance of considering uremic encephalopathy in the differential diagnosis of movement disorders in patients with underlying kidney dysfunction, even in the context of chronic alcoholism.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.47387,PMC10659565,alcohol withdrawal; case report; chronic kidney disease (ckd); encephalopathy; movement disorder,Case Reports,United States,eng

38433438,A 78-Year-Old Woman with Sudden Onset of Left-Sided Hemiballismus.,"Israelyan, Arman; Ludlow, John; Pyatka, Nataliya; Durant, Edward J",Israelyan,"BACKGROUND Hemiballismus is the most severe form of chorea and is a hyperkinetic disorder characterized by involuntary, high-amplitude movements of the ipsilateral arm and leg, due to lesions of the contralateral side of the central nervous system. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes and nonketotic hyperglycemia are predominant etiologies of hemiballismus. Case reports highlighting hemiballismus associated with temporal and parietal lobe infarcts have been published, although research of frontal lobe involvement is limited. CASE REPORT A 78-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with sudden-onset left-sided hemiballismus. On examination, she was alert, oriented to self and time, and able to follow commands. Her neurologic examination was notable for left-sided hemiballismus, described by the provider as periodic, uncontrolled, and involving a ""flinging"" motion of the left upper and lower extremities, sparing the face. She was treated with benzodiazepines in the Emergency Department and administered intravenous levetiracetam. Computed tomography of the head without contrast revealed an old left basal ganglia lacunar infarct. The patient was then admitted to the inpatient service, where magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an acute punctate left superior frontal gyrus cortical infarct. Outpatient electroencephalogram revealed right anterior hemisphere dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS We describe a patient with left-sided sudden onset hemiballismus with an acute infarct of the ipsilateral superior frontal gyrus. This case highlights that brain lesions separate from the basal ganglia can induce hemiballismus, particularly within the frontal lobe, which warrants further research into precentral sulcus functioning and its role in modulating motor activity.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.941840,PMC10926233,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Postoperative single photon emission computed tomography with technetium-99m-hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime revealed a global low-perfusion area in the right cerebral hemisphere. Right carotid angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the trunk of the right middle cerebral artery. The cerebral blood flow in the right cerebral hemisphere had probably already decreased to nearly the critical level and was reduced further by the left SDH, inducing the left-sided hemichorea due to dysfunction of the right cerebral hemisphere.

Most reports show an association between chorea and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies in SLE patients. The objective of this study was to describe the association of aPL antibodies with lupus chorea and its possible role in the pathogenesis of chorea. We made a retrospective review of all cases of lupus chorea between 1989 and 2007 in a tertiary care center in Mexico City. We found 7 episodes of chorea in 5 patients with SLE. In 2 patients (3 episodes), chorea was associated with cerebral ischemia; one of these cases had positive anticardiolipin (aCL) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, whereas the other was diagnosed as having vascular lipohyalinosis as the probable cause of cerebral ischemia. In 3 patients (4 episodes), an immune-mediated mechanism was suspected; these cases had negative aPL at the onset of chorea, but IgM aCL antibodies became positive later. In most episodes, chorea seems to be immunologically mediated and was associated with a later appearance of IgM aCL antibodies. Chorea in patients with lupus may also be caused by cerebral ischemia, and in some cases, it may be associated with IgG aCL antibodies.",{},,Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,10.1097/RHU.0b013e31820e7c8d,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The pathogenesis of this movement disorder involves the gabaergic and enkephalinergic neurons of the striatal matrice which mainly projects on the external globus pallidus. A destruction of the striatal neurons of the indirect striato-thalamo-cortical ways may reduce their inhibitory out flow on normal inhibited thalamic and cortical structures and then create abnormal choreiform movements. The scarcity of this phenomenon can be explained by: 1) the repartition of the enkephalinergic local circuit neurons which represent but one third of the motor striatal neuronal population; 2) the type of vascularisation which often involves larger territories in the striatum and the globus pallidus or the anterior limb of the internal capsule. These abnormal movements are often transient because of the regulation of accessory striato-nigro-striatal, cortico-striato-nigro-thalamo-cortical and cortico-luysin circuits.

Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is usually associated with neurological manifestations, such as hemichorea, focal epileptic seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral facial paralysis. This report describes a 59-year-old woman presenting with hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis due to newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, as well as a temporary episode of central facial paralysis, which regressed within a few days after medical treatment and metabolic correction. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old patient with hypertension and a family history of diabetes mellitus presented with polyuro-polydipsic syndrome and signs of metabolic ketoacidosis, with an elevated anion gap, compatible with newly discovered type 1 diabetes mellitus. Six hours after admission, we noted the abrupt onset of left central facial paralysis, with no brain damage shown on magnetic resonance imaging. Initially, the diagnosis was transient ischemic attack. After a second, normal cerebral magnetic resonance image on the fourth day, and clinical improvement on the fifth day after metabolic correction by insulin therapy and rehydration, the diagnosis of a regressive central facial paralysis was retained. CONCLUSIONS Central facial paralysis in diabetic ketoacidosis is a rare neuroendocrine entity. The pathophysiological mechanisms that can explain the occurrence of central facial paralysis are not yet described and require further investigation. This report highlights the importance of diagnosis, early management of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, and reversibility of central facial paralysis after treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.942425,PMC11334088,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

10525389,Hemiballismus and brain metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.,"Ziainia, T; Resnik, E",Ziainia,"Brain metastases from cervical carcinoma are rare. Accompanying symptoms depend on the location of the metastatic lesions. Hemiballismus refers to a rare movement disorder characterized by involuntary, large amplitude movements of the limbs of one side of the body. The area of the brain controlling the limb movement is in the subthalamic nucleus of the contralateral side. In contrast, the usual location of brain metastases from cervical cancer is in the frontal and parietal parenchyma. There have been reported cases of hemiballismus secondary to metastatic carcinoma of the breast, lung, and gall bladder. This is the first reported case of putative cervical cancer metastases associated with hemiballismus. A 38-year-old Caucasian female was diagnosed with FIGO stage II-B poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Para-aortic lymph nodes were positive for metastatic disease. The patient was treated by radiation with hydroxyurea chemosensitization. Four months after the initial diagnosis she presented with acute onset of hemiballismus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed a solitary lesion in the left cerebral peduncle extending into the inferior aspect of the left basal ganglia complex. The lesion was inaccessible to biopsy or excision. Palliative radiation therapy to the brain was unsuccessful and the patient expired 1 year following primary presentation. Treatment of hemiballismus is directed to its underlying causes. Some brain metastases from cervical cancer may be palliated or even cured by surgical resection and radiation therapy. Although not conclusive, it appears that hemiballismus in a setting of metastatic cervical cancer has a poor prognosis and little benefit from irradiation.",{},,Gynecologic oncology,10.1006/gyno.1999.5551,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Staged angioplasty is reportedly an effective strategy to avoid cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. We encountered a case of internal carotid artery stenosis with a rare clinical presentation of limb shaking that was successfully improved by staged angioplasty. To our knowledge, there are no reported cases of limb shaking treated with staged angioplasty.A 76-year-old woman presented with continuous chorea in her left lower limb and shoulder. Medical examination revealed a tiny cerebral infarction in the right corona radiata and severe right internal carotid artery stenosis. Angiography showed near occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Staged angioplasty was performed to avoid the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. The first angioplasty resulted in an expanded diameter of 2.5 mm and was followed by definitive carotid artery stenting using a closed-cell stent 3.5 weeks later. Limb shaking improved in a stepwise manner along with an improvement in internal carotid artery stenosis and distal flow state with no signs of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. Patients with internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion presenting with limb shaking have been suggested to have impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, which is also thought to be a risk factor for cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. The stepwise improvement in limb shaking observed in this case supports the idea that the pathophysiology of limb shaking is related to cerebral haemodynamic impairment. Measures to prevent cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, including staged angioplasty, should be actively considered in patients with limb shaking because the symptoms themselves suggest severe hypoperfusion.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The neuroradiology journal,10.1177/19714009211036690,PMC9130620,Carotid stenosis; hyperperfusion syndrome; limb shaking; staged angioplasty,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report a case of a 79 year-old female patient who presented to the ED with a 12 h history of a left sided hemichoreoathetosis. Laboratory results revealed pronounced nonketotic hyperglycemia [27 mmol/L (486 mg/dL); HbA1c 140 mmol/mol (15 %)] and brain MRI showed bilateral T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia, more noticeable on the right side. One week before she had been admitted with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack consisting in left hemiparesthesia, also with nonketotic hyperglycemia [38.9 mmol/L (700 mg/dL)] and was discharged home with partial correction of her metabolic disturbance. The movement disorder did not improve with adequate glycemic control so haloperidol was started. Six weeks later she was seen on an outpatient basis. She still had minimal residual involuntary movements of the left arm and leg. Laboratory exams revealed a well controlled diabetes mellitus [glycemia 6.0 mmol/L (109 mg/dL), HbA1c 57 mmol/mol (7.4 %)]. In conclusion, the syndrome of dyskinesia associated to hyperglycemia and hyperintensity in the basal ganglia on T1 - weighted MR images is a rare, intriguing and yet incompletely understood complication of diabetes mellitus. The increasing number of reported cases may help to better understand its peculiarities such as the existence of a clear clinical radiological dissociation and to unveil pathophysiological aspects.

In previous case studies, imaging findings have been in the basal ganglia as hyperintense lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or hyperdensities on computerized tomography (CT). This case is unique due to abnormal findings in the MRI T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in areas not previously reported-the thalamus and midbrain/pons. As in other NKH cases, the patient improved both clinically and radiologically.

Clinical history and examination yielded multiple differential diagnoses including deposition and metabolic disorders, autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis involving basal ganglia, and neurodegenerative disorders with chorea and cognitive impairment. However, magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of paramagnetic substance deposition, which came out to be manganese after laboratory investigations. History, clinical examinations, and investigation results pointed towards a diagnosis of acquired hypermanganesemia due to over-ingestion of manganese containing substance (i.e., black tea). He was treated symptomatically and with chelation therapy (calcium disodium edetate). At the sixth month of follow-up, complete resolution of chorea, dysarthria and partial amelioration of rigidity were observed. His cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities improved.

We report a case of neuro-Behçet's disease in a 67-year-old woman with depression and chorea that occurred 22 years after the onset of intestinal Behçet's disease. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequence demonstrated lesions more clearly than did T2-weighted MRI. Some of the lesions appeared as small ring-like foci, i.e. low-intensity spots rimmed with remarkable hyperintense signals, in the periventricular white matter and basal ganglia. A review of the literature revealed that the onset of chorea in cases of Behçet's disease varied from the time of onset of Behçet's disease to 31 years after onset of the disease. Psychiatric manifestations have often been associated with neuro-Behçet's disease. In the present patient, treatment with prednisolone resolved the chorea, suggesting that the chorea was caused by an autoimmune mechanism. It seems likely that the long-term development of vasculitis in patients with Behçet's disease results in the formation of these particular brain lesions on FLAIR MR images. Chorea should be taken into consideration as one of the manifestations of Behçet's disease, even many years after remission of the disease.","DictElement({'Year': '2004', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2004,Clinical rheumatology,10.1007/s10067-004-0897-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

Recently de Courten-Meyers and colleagues reported that occluding the middle cerebral artery of markedly hyperglycemic cats was associated with 5-fold more frequent and 25-fold more extensive hemorrhage into infarcts than in normoglycemic animals. Hemorrhage associated with hyperglycemia in cats was much more pronounced with reperfusion than with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. We describe two patients with a unique presentation of diffuse hemorrhagic infarction of the caudate and lentiform nuclei associated with initially marked hyperglycemia and the subsequent development of hemichorea. We hypothesize that the marked hyperglycemia due to poor control of diabetes contributed to the hemorrhagic change of the caudate and lenticular nuclei. Because the hemorrhage in hyperglycemic cats was more pronounced in the setting of reperfusion, hemorrhagic risk associated with hyperglycemia should be investigated, particularly in ongoing thrombolytic treatment trials for acute ischemic stroke. We encourage other acute stroke investigators to prospectively look at the risk of brain hemorrhage in stroke patients with marked hyperglycemia.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.26.3.484,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Following the disappearance of the characteristic T1 hyperintensity at 3 months after onset, an MRI demonstrated T2* hypointensity and atrophic changes in the contralateral striatum, suggesting irreversible neuronal loss and some vascular proliferation. The electrophysiological examination using transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed significantly shorter cortical silent periods (CSPs) on the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), possibly in relation to cortical hyperexcitability. We have applied 10 daily sessions of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the contralateral M1 to reduce the hyperexcitability.

Despite promising results, this treatment brings a completely new spectrum of adverse events, distinct from those experienced with small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Neurologic immune-related adverse events may be serious and potentially life-threatening complications requiring immediate immunosuppressive therapy. Only a few cases of immune-related encephalitis induced by checkpoint inhibitors have been described and the data regarding the management of this serious adverse event are limited. We report the case of a 63-year-old white man with metastatic renal cancer who developed severe chorea-like dyskinesia during nivolumab therapy. The findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging and flow cytometry of cerebrospinal fluid, and the positivity of anti-paraneoplastic antigen Ma2 immunoglobuline G class autoantibodies were consistent with a diagnosis of immune-related encephalitis. High-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy was started immediately, with no signs of improvement, even when infliximab was added. Our patient refused further hospitalization and was discharged. Three weeks later, he presented with signs of severe urosepsis. Despite intensive treatment, he died 4 days after admission. The management of less frequent immune-related adverse events has not been fully established and more information is required to provide uniform recommendations. Immune-related encephalitis is a severe and potentially fatal complication requiring immediate hospital admission and extensive immunosuppressive therapy.

Here we report a 55-year-old female, from Sri Lanka, who presented with involuntary movements of the left upper and lower limbs. Her past medical history included diabetes mellitus and she was on warfarin 5 mg daily for a mechanical mitral and tricuspid valve replacement. The random blood sugar on admission was 462 mg/dL and the last INR was 3.03. While hemiballismus has multiple etiologies, intracranial hemorrhage would be the main differential in a patient on anticoagulation. Other differentials include drug-induced dyskinesia, metabolic abnormalities, and autoimmune etiologies. Hemiballismus in the presence of high blood glucose should always raise the suspicion of diabetic striatopathy. The non-contrast computed tomography of the brain showed hyperdensity in the right-side caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, and globus pallidus which is a characteristic of diabetic striatopathy but could have been mistaken for an intracranial hemorrhage. The involuntary movements improved with glucose control and treatment with clonazepam and tetrabenazine. This case highlights the potential for misdiagnosis of diabetic striatopathy as an intracranial hemorrhage in a patient on warfarin, which can lead to delays in appropriate management and erroneous omission of warfarin. Early recognition and treatment of diabetic striatopathy can lead to significant improvement in the quality of life.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,SAGE open medical case reports,10.1177/2050313X231222203,PMC10768625,Hemichorea-hemiballismus; diabetic striatopathy; involuntary movements of limbs,Case Reports,England,eng

We present a case of DS mimicking an acute stroke, outline a few uncommon/atypical features, and report for the first time the parenchymal transcranial sonography (pTCS) findings. <i>Case Report</i>: An 86-year-old man, treated for insulin-dependent diabetes, presented at an emergency department because of the occurrence of isolated choreo-athetotic movements in his left limbs with fluctuations in the location, frequency, and duration. The blood glucose level was 569 mg/dL. Both urgent and follow-up brain computed tomography (CT) were negative for recent lesions whereas pTCS revealed hyperechogenicity in the right lenticular nucleus. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T1-weighted hyperintensity in the right putamen with negative diffusion-weighted imaging. The symptoms were responsive to glucose control and haloperidol administration, although they persisted during sleep. <i>Conclusions</i>: Unlike previously described cases characterized by hemichorea and/or hemiballism, our patient presented with a stroke-like onset of unilateral irregular choreo-athetotic movements. Notably, based on CT alone, it would not have been possible to distinguish DS from a stroke. In this scenario, the pTCS hyperechogenicity of the right lenticular nucleus helped to hypothesize a metabolic disorder, which was subsequently confirmed by MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",10.3390/diagnostics12112838,PMC9689337,diabetic striatopathy; differential diagnosis; emergency; metabolic dysfunction; neuroimaging,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

In this article, we describe a diagnostic challenge in the ED in which a patient presents with hyperkinetic movements that are initially diagnosed as hemichorea-hemiballismus (HCHB) but are subsequently found to be limb-shaking syndrome with important therapeutic opportunities. Following a diagnosis of left carotid obstruction, the patient underwent left carotid endarterectomy 5 days after admission. Six months after surgery, the patient had no further symptoms, and an ultrasound scan and magnetic resonance angiography have confirmed no restenosis. Limb shaking is an uncommon form of transient ischemic attack that should be recognized and differentiated from conditions such as focal motor seizures. Recognition will almost invariably indicate carotid artery occlusion, and timely treatment may not only abolish the attacks in patients but also reduce their risk of stroke. HCHB represents a spectrum of hyperkinetic movement disorders varying in the severity of choreic and/or ballistic movements.

Diagnostic agreement was present in all but five cases. Statistical analyses of data from the Halstead Battery supported the clinical analyses in terms of indicating both the presence and, to a lesser degree, the location of organic impairment.

A further case is reported in the present paper. The definition of bilateral ballism is discussed, its movements described and the differences from chorea outlined. The most important difference from hemiballism is in the pathological substrate where, in most bilateral cases, diffuse lesions have been reported on both sides of the basal ganglia, without preferential involvement of the subthalamic nucleus. In our case, a fronto-temporal infarction was found. In the cases reported to date, the outcome had varied from death to complete recovery, partly depending on the aetiology, which is most frequently vascular.

The disease commonly affects individuals of Asian descent, females, and the elderly. Patients usually present with hemiballism-hemichorea caused by nonketotic hyperglycemia. Hemiballism-hemichorea is defined as involuntary continuous random appearing movement involving one side of the body. This movement disorder may develop secondary to stroke, diabetic striatopathy, neoplasm, infection, Wilson's disease, and thyrotoxicosis. Despite being rare, prompt recognition of a hyperglycemia-induced hemiballism-hemichorea is essential because the symptoms are reversible with correction of hyperglycemia. Diagnosis is possible based on blood analysis and neuroimaging findings. Laboratory tests reveal raised blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels which indicate poorly controlled diabetes. Neuroimaging provides suggestive findings of diabetic striatopathy which are hyperattenuation on computed tomography and hyperintensity on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the basal ganglia.

Our patient was a 66-year-old female with diabetes mellitus who suddenly developed right hemichorea, mild muscle weakness of the right upper extremity, ideational apraxia, and acalculia. Her blood glucose was 600 mg/dL, and HbA1c was 13.3%. After the patient underwent head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a new cerebral infarction was observed in the left frontal lobe, and treatment was started with edaravone and cilostazol. At the same time, insulin treatment was also started for hyperglycemia. The acalculia and ideational apraxia improved approximately 1 week after treatment initiated, and the hemichorea also decreased. ECD-SPECT was performed on admission, and it was observed that blood flow was decreased in the left frontal lobe and striatum, but increased in the thalamus; two weeks later on follow-up ECD-SPECT, blood flow had increased slightly in the left forebrain and striatum, while it had decreased slightly in the thalamus. This suggests that the cause of hemichorea was related to ischemia. When the activity of the pallidum is impaired, it is presumed that the inhibitory activity towards the thalamus weakens and the thalamic cells become over-excited, causing chorea.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,10.1016/j.jcma.2013.12.004,,ECD-SPECT; cerebral infarction; diabetes mellitus; hemichorea; regional cerebral blood flow,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

The ballistic movement is sometimes so violent that progressive exhaustion results. The authors report two such cases, which were successfully treated by chronic thalamic stimulation. The lesions responsible for the ballistic movement in these patients were located near the subthalamic nucleus and in the putamen, respectively. The thalamic nucleus ventrolateralis and nucleus ventralis intermedius were stimulated with 0.2 to 0.3 msec pulses at 50 to 150 Hz and 4 to 7 V continuously during the day. Several weeks later, complete control of the hemiballismus was achieved during stimulation. The improvement was clearly not attributable to spontaneous recovery, because ballistic movement reappeared after termination of the stimulation. The stimulation has remained effective for more than 16 months in both cases without any serious complications.

Cortical laminar necrosis and polymicrocavitation in the cortex and basal ganglia are combined with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Microscopically, Alzheimer type II astrocytes and cytoplasmic glycogen granules are characteristic. Recent neuroradiological observations in patients with liver failure have shown a specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance with a hyperintense T1 signal in the pallidum, putamen, and, rarely, mesencephalon. Using clues from a similar MR appearance in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition as well as animals given parenteral manganese, and the knowledge that manganese is cleared by the hepatobiliary system, deposition of manganese in the brain is postulated in patients with CAHD.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed lesions at lower left and right cerebellar hemisphere, one of them thalamus - mesencephalic suggesting an opportunistic infection or an HIV associated encephalopathy. Lumbar puncture, brain biopsy and successive neuroimaging were not conclusive for one disease and despite the use of directed therapy for cerebral toxoplasmosis, meningeal tuberculosis, anti-retrovirals and sedative medication, after over 6 weeks of hospitalization pallidotomy was performed. After 5 months of oral and surgical treatment the patient showed clinical, immunological and radiological recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,IDCases,10.1016/j.idcr.2016.08.002,PMC4995393,HIV; Hemiballismus; Pallidotomy,Journal Article; Case Reports,Netherlands,eng
38347980,Characterization of Diabetic Striatopathy With Repeated Follow-Up Using Multiple Imaging Studies.,"Nishimura, Ayumi; Kado, Tomonobu; Tobe, Kazuyuki",Nishimura,"Diabetic striatopathy is a rare condition with a prevalence of less than one in 100,000. Herein, we report a case of diabetic striatopathy exacerbated by hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, with repeated follow-up with multiple imaging studies. This case suggested that putamen neuronal loss and dysfunction, gliosis, and ischemia are associated with diabetic striatopathy pathophysiology. In addition, striatal hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI images was more pronounced after symptom remission when evaluated several times over a short period. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that even if MRI findings are normal in the very early stages of the onset of diabetic striatopathy, repeating MRIs at intervals may reveal typical findings.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.52223,PMC10861287,diabetes mellitus; diabetic chorea; diabetic striatopathy; hyperglycemic non-ketotic hemiballism; hyperglycemic non-ketotic hemichorea; neuroimaging,Case Reports,United States,eng

Here, we report a case of DS with relapsed hemichorea-hemiballism attacks even during euglycemic period, and the MRI changes by volumetric analysis. A 69-year-old diabetic female suffered from a relapsed episode of hemichorea-hemiballism during her euglycemic period after the treatment of hyperglycemia. To investigate the serial MRI changes in a case with diabetic striatopathy who had clinical hemichorea-hemiballism syndrome. Semi-quantitative volumetric analyses from T1 images of these brain MRIs were obtained during the disease course. Besides, the negative finding of the first brain MRI during her first hospital admission, three afterward MRI examinations disclosed a waxing-and-waning mode of volume change from high-signal T1 images in left striatum. The clinical symptoms paralleled with the neuroimage changes in striatum. The MR signal volume changes were valuable for the clinical course of the hemichorea-hemiballism caused by diabetic striatopathy LESSONS:: Serial MR images for the diabetic striatopathy presented as a key pathognomonic relationship with the clinical hemichorea-hemiballism syndrome, assessed by our simplied volumetric analysis.

12072824,[Sub-cortico-frontal encephalopathy and choreic movements related to recombinant interferon-alpha 2b].,"Moulignier, A; Allo, S; Singer, B; Monge-Strauss, M F; Zittoun, R; Gout, O",Moulignier,"Interferon (IFN)-alpha is associated with central nervous system (CNS) side effects such as depression and suicide ideation, somnolence, confusion, drowsiness, psychomotor slowing, memory impairment and visual disorientation. More severe complications are uncommon and include frank paranoia, dementia, coma, seizures and neuropathy. With the increasing long-term and extensive use of interferon (IFN)-alpha several new neurologic adverse effects have been recognized. We report on two patients who developed severe subcortico-frontal impairment, associated in one case with choreic movements, after a long-term treatment with IFN-alpha 2b for hematologic malignancies. Our patients rapidly and completely recovered from their cognitive and motor symptoms after the discontinuation of the drug. The same neurologic symptoms reappeared when we attempted to reintroduce lower doses of IFN-alpha in one case. Although little is known regarding IFN-alpha actions in the CNS, several possible mechanisms may underlie its neurotoxicity and might result from complex direct and indirect effects involving brain vasculature, neuroendocrine system, neurotoxic secondary cytokines'release and neurotransmitters.",{},,Revue neurologique,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre
18441498,[Choreic involuntary movement that occurred during therapy for diabetes mellitus].,"Ogawa, Katsuhiko; Suzuki, Yutaka; Kamei, Satoshi; Mizutani, Tomohiko",Ogawa,"A 73-year-old woman was admitted with dry mouth, polyposia, polyuria, hyperglycemia (611 mg/dl) and positive urine ketone bodies. Blood glucose levels decreased gradually after initiation of insulin injections. The patient was discharged, but developed involuntary movement of the right extremities on the following day. At that time, her blood glucose levels were 54 mg/dl. Four days later, she was admitted to our Neurology Ward because the movement worsened. On admission, choreic involuntary movements were severe in the right extremities and slight in the left extremities. Urine ketone bodies were negative, but HbA1c had elevated to 11.7%. Although a brain CT did not detect any abnormal density areas, we suspected that the patient had cerebral infarction of the basal ganglia or the parietal lobe on the left side, or of the subthalamic nucleus on the right side because choreic involuntary movements were more prominent on the right side. Anti-platelet therapy was performed, but the involuntary movements persisted. A T1-weighted image of brain MRI, performed on the 4th day after hospitalization, detected abnormal high intensity areas in the bilateral putamens. The abnormal area in the left putamen was more prominent. This MRI finding was consistent with that of diabetic chorea-ballism. Surface electromyography demonstrated the simultaneous appearance of grouping discharges in the biceps and triceps muscles of the right arm. We diagnosed the patient as having diabetic chorea based on the MRI findings, and discontinued anti-platelet therapy. MRI should be performed as soon as possible in diabetic patients with acute-onset chorea-ballism which occurs on one side or predominantly on one side in order to differentiate diabetic chorea-ballism from cerebral infarction.",{},,Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.
