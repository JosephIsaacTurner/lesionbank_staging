This had followed an initial episode of transient drowsiness which lasted 24 hours. On examination, there was some evidence of visual memory and frontal lobe deficits. A brain CT scan showed bilateral thalamic infarcts and a brain SPECT scan showed bilateral hypoperfusion of the frontal lobes. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of thalamic infarction associated with acute-onset cyclical affective psychosis with clinical and neurophysiological features of frontal lobe syndrome. The case also highlights the possible role of thalamo-frontal circuits in the pathogenesis of the Kleine-Levin syndrome.",{},,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,10.1192/bjp.163.1.113,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

33823819,An autopsy-proven case of Corticobasal degeneration heralded by Pontine infarction.,"Yoo, Dallah; Park, Sung-Hye; Yu, Sungwook; Ahn, Tae-Beom",Yoo,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by insidious progression with poorly-delineated long latent period. Antecedent clinical insult could rarely unmask latent neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an autopsy-proven case of corticobasal degeneration which was preceded by a lacunar infarction. A 58-year-old man presented with acute ataxia associated with a lacunar infarction in the right paramedian pons. His ataxia persisted with additional progressive gait difficulty and left arm clumsiness. Six months later, a follow-up neurological examination showed asymmetrical bradykinesia, apraxia, dystonic posturing, postural instability, and mild ataxia of the left limbs. Cognitive examination revealed frontal executive dysfunction and visuospatial difficulties. Dopamine transporter imaging scan demonstrated bilateral reduced uptakes in mid-to-posterior putamen, more prominent on the right side. Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, asymmetric limb dystonia, and ideomotor apraxia became more conspicuous, while limb ataxia gradually vanished. The patient became unable to walk without assistance after 1 year, and died 4 years after the symptom onset. Autopsy findings showed frontoparietal cortical atrophy, ballooned neurons, and phosphorylated tau-positive astrocytic plaques and neuropil threads with gliosis and neuronal loss, confirming the corticobasal degeneration. The case illustrates that precedent clinical events such as stroke might tip a patient with subclinical CBS into overt clinical manifestations.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-021-02178-9,PMC8022434,Autopsy; Case report; Corticobasal degeneration; Stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

26998574,Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis: A Review and Neuropsychological Case Study.,"Loughan, Ashlee R; Allen, Aislyn; Perna, Robert; Malkin, Mark G",Loughan,"Anti-N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) Encephalitis is an autoimmune-mediated encephalitis, which may be associated with a tumor, which occurs when antibodies bind central NMDA receptors. Although typically diagnosed in women, approximately 20% of cases have been males. Due to the challenges with identification, imaging, and diverse symptom presentation, this syndrome is often misdiagnosed. Accurate diagnosis may provide an opportunity for introduction of disease-modifying therapies, which may alter disease trajectory. Moreover, neuropsychology has yet to fully clarify the pattern of impairments expected with this disorder. This manuscript reviews a single case study of a 42-year-old male diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis. Neuropsychological evaluation was completed subsequent to diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Ongoing patient complaints, approximately six months post diagnosis, included reduced sustained attention, poor word retrieval, and daily forgetfulness. Adaptive skills were improved following rehabilitation. Direct testing revealed mildly impaired sustained attention, processing speed, oral word fluency, and executive functioning. All other cognitive domains were within estimated premorbid range, low average to average. Neuropsychological deficits were consistent with mild frontal brain dysfunction and continued recovery. This case illustrates the need for medical and psychological practitioners to understand NMDAR encephalitis, its symptom presentation, and related neuropsychological impact; particularly with the potential for misdiagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1080/13854046.2015.1132772,,Anti-N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Encephalitis; Autoimmune-mediated encephalitis.; Cognition; Executive dysfunction,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng
24868121,Executive and language control in the multilingual brain.,"Kong, Anthony Pak-Hin; Abutalebi, Jubin; Lam, Karen Sze-Yan; Weekes, Brendan",Kong,"Neuroimaging studies suggest that the neural network involved in language control may not be specific to bi-/multilingualism but is part of a domain-general executive control system. We report a trilingual case of a Cantonese (L1), English (L2), and Mandarin (L3) speaker, Dr. T, who sustained a brain injury at the age of 77 causing lesions in the left frontal lobe and in the left temporo-parietal areas resulting in fluent aphasia. Dr. T's executive functions were impaired according to a modified version of the Stroop color-word test and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance was characterized by frequent perseveration errors. Dr. T demonstrated pathological language switching and mixing across her three languages. Code switching in Cantonese was more prominent in discourse production than confrontation naming. Our case suggests that voluntary control of spoken word production in trilingual speakers shares neural substrata in the frontobasal ganglia system with domain-general executive control mechanisms. One prediction is that lesions to such a system would give rise to both pathological switching and impairments of executive functions in trilingual speakers.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2014/527951,PMC4020527,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng
26567227,Conservative vs. Surgical Management of Post-Traumatic Epidural Hematoma: A Case and Review of Literature.,"Maugeri, Rosario; Anderson, David Greg; Graziano, Francesca; Meccio, Flavia; Visocchi, Massimiliano; Iacopino, Domenico Gerardo",Maugeri,"Trauma is the leading cause of death in people younger than 45 years and head injury is the main cause of trauma mortality. Although epidural hematomas are relatively uncommon (less than 1% of all patients with head injuries and fewer than 10% of those who are comatose), they should always be considered in evaluation of a serious head injury. Patients with epidural hematomas who meet surgical criteria and receive prompt surgical intervention can have an excellent prognosis, presumably owing to limited underlying primary brain damage from the traumatic event. The decision to perform a surgery in a patient with a traumatic extraaxial hematoma is dependent on several factors (neurological status, size of hematoma, age of patients, CT findings) but also may depend on the judgement of the treating neurosurgeon. A 30-year old man arrived at our Emergency Department after a traumatic brain injury. General examination revealed severe headache, no motor or sensory disturbances, and no clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. A CT scan documented a significant left fronto-parietal epidural hematoma, which was considered suitable for surgical evacuation. The patient refused surgery. Following CT scan revealed a minimal increase in the size of the hematoma and of midline shift. The neurologic examination maintained stable and the patient continued to refuse the surgical treatment. Next follow up CT scans demonstrated a progressive resorption of hematoma. We report an unusual case of a remarkable epidural hematoma managed conservatively with a favorable clinical outcome. This case report is intended to rather add to the growing knowledge regarding the best management for this serious and acute pathology.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/ajcr.895231,PMC4652627,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

The patient clinically presented a cerebellar and dysexecutive syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a contrast enhancing ponto-mesencephalic lesion with a volume of 4.8cm<sup>3</sup>. Neuropsychological tests showed pronounced executive dysfunctions, reduced visuoconstructive skills, attentional deficits, echolalia, and non-fluent speech production. After cortisone and plasmapheresis, the cerebellar syndrome improved but manual fine motor skills and executive dysfunctions persisted. After three months, symptoms remitted except for a slight gait imbalance. After six months, neuropsychological tests were normal except for a moderate attention deficit. MRI revealed a clear regression of the ponto-mesencephalic lesion to a volume of 2.4cm<sup>3</sup> without contrast enhancement.

Long-term cognitive recovery after PCI is not well described. However, the adult brain is remarkably plastic, capable of adapting and remodeling. We describe a 43-year-old right-handed woman who complained of black spots in both eyes, headaches, photophobia, and a feeling she would faint. Initial neurological exam and a CT scan were normal; she was diagnosed with ocular migraine. A second neurological exam a week later showed left superior quadrantopsia; an MRI scan suggested right occipito-temporal infarct. In subsequent months, the patient complained of fatigue, quadrantanopsia, memory problems, and topographical disorientation. The patient participated in multi-modality treatment, and in self-directed arts projects and physical activities. Six years later, she reported noticeable improvements in cognition and daily functioning, which were documented on neurocognitive testing. Comparison between initial and subsequent MRIs using FreeSurfer 5.3 identified neuroplastic brain changes in areas serving similar functions to the areas injured from the stroke.

25520275,Cognitive and affective disturbances following focal brainstem lesions: a review and report of three cases.,"D'aes, Tine; Mariën, Peter",D'aes,"Although insights in cerebellar neurocognition and affect are continuously growing, little is known about the role of the brainstem in cognitive and behavioural processing. In this paper, it is hypothesized that the brainstem is an inherent functional part of the cerebellocerebral network subserving cognition and affect, and that isolated brainstem damage may cause a constellation of symptoms closely resembling the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) following cerebellar pathology. In order to investigate these premises, the available literature on cognitive and affective disturbances following brainstem lesions was critically reviewed starting from the pioneer descriptions in the 1950s till June 2012. Three personal cases were added to a study group of 75 cases with isolated vascular brainstem damage. In a cohort of 30 patients that allowed construction of anatomoclinical correlations in a reliable way, a range of cognitive and behavioural symptoms, typically associated with impairment of cortical or limbic areas, were identified. Executive dysfunction, attentional deficits and a decline in general intellectual capacity represent the most common cognitive findings, but memory, visuospatial skills, language and praxis may be impaired as well. Almost half of the cases presented with behavioural or affective changes. Analysis of SPECT findings indicates that functional suppression of frontal, parietal and to a lesser extent also the temporal areas are common phenomena after isolated brainstem stroke. As reflected by diaschisis affecting the cerebellocerebral network, a loss of excitatory input from the brainstem to the cerebellum and cerebrum may induce disruption of several cortical regions as well as emotional control centres resulting in and a constellation of symptoms closely resembling the CCAS. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying brainstem-induced cognitive and affective disturbances is discussed.",{},,"Cerebellum (London, England)",10.1007/s12311-014-0626-8,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng
26674610,Locked-In Syndrome: Case Report and Discussion of Decisional Capacity.,"Maiser, Samuel; Kabir, Ashish; Sabsevitz, David; Peltier, Wendy",Maiser,"Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurologic disorder rendering an individual quadriplegic and anarthric with preserved self-awareness and normal if not near-normal cognition. A lesion to the ventral pons causes the classic form of LIS, and patients can typically interact with their environment with eye/eyelid movements. LIS patients may live for years with preserved quality of life (QoL) and cognitive function, but with severe disability. However, medical providers and family often underestimate the patient's QoL, and choose less aggressive care. Prompt assessment of decisionality in LIS patients is challenging, but it must be done to allow these patients to participate in their care. We present the case of a 54-year-old man with LIS. The medical team recommended comfort measures, but the family advocated involving the patient in goals of care discussions. The patient was determined to be decisional during the acute hospitalization, and he elected for life-prolonging care. This case emphasizes the importance of unbiased shared decision making, but also the importance of utilizing a practical framework to assess the decision-making capacity in these patients. We provide a suggested approach to determining decision-making capacity in similar cases or conditions.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of pain and symptom management,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2015.10.021,,Stroke; decision-making capacity; ethics; neuropsychology; surrogate,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The neurologic examination has served as the primary monitor for secondary brain injury in patients admitted to the neurocritical care unit. However, the International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring in Neurocritical Care concluded that frequent bedside examinations are not sufficient to detect and prevent secondary brain injury and that integration of multimodality monitoring with advanced informatics tools will most likely enhance our assessments compared to the clinical examinations alone. This article reviews the invasive and noninvasive technologies used to monitor focal and global neurophysiologic cerebral alterations.

FL damage can lead to executive dysfunction by influencing frontal-subcortical circuits (dorsolateral, orbitofrontal, ventromedial). Damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can lead to deterioration in EF, whereas damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) can lead to personality changes with the characteristic of disinhibition and irritability. In addition, damage to the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) can result in decreased spontaneity. Neuropsychological tests are important components in the assessment of EF including goal-directed behavior, decision-making, risk assessment, making plans for the future, setting of priorities and order of our actions. Clinical conditions affecting frontal-subcortical connections outside of the FL can also lead to executive dysfunctions and frontal lobe syndrome (FLS). This case report is about an adolescent patient diagnosed as FLS. The clinical symptoms, assessment and treatment processes of this case are discussed in this report. The case is a 15-year-old boy that was admitted to our clinic with behavioral problems, which began after a car accident three years ago. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain indicated hyperintense signal increase in periventricular deep white matter that is associated with traumatic brain damage. Neuropsychological tests results (Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Serial Digit Learning Test, Line Orientation Test, Verbal Memory Processes Scale) have demonstrated impairment in cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, setting priority, inappropriate response inhibition, sustained attention, planning, problem solving, organization skills and subcortical memory functions. We thought that cognitive and behavioral symptoms of this case were associated with the dysfunctions of frontal-subcortical circuits, independent of an obvious frontal lesion.

This paper studied whether late cranioplasty improves a specific pattern of cognitive functions. A case series of five TBI patients with craniectomy undergoing late cranioplasty (median interval time: 14 months, range: 12-36). Longitudinal neuropsychological and brain MRI assessments 1 week before cranioplasty and 3 months later. After cranioplasty, mean score of the verbal fluency test improved compared to pre-cranioplasty (p = 0.02). Similarly, significant improvements after cranioplasty were observed in other tests scores exploring executive functions, such as working memory (p = 0.03) and speed of attention (p = 0.04), independently from the size and site of cranioplasty. The cognitive improvement induced by cranioplasty, even when performed after a long interval from craniectomy, may be due to the restoration of physiological cerebrospinal fluid circulation which, in turn, allows an efficient brain volume transmission signal circulation. The restoration of this essential way of signal communication seems to affect large-scale neuronal networks responsible for the executive functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.844857,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

Mapping of executive functions is particularly challenging because of their complex nature, with only a handful of reports published so far. Here, we propose the recording of neural activity directly from the surface of the brain using electrocorticography to map executive functions and demonstrate its feasibility and potential utility. To track a neural signature of executive function, we recorded neural activity using electrocorticography during awake surgery from the frontal cortex of three patients judged to have an appearance of diffuse low-grade glioma. Based on existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence from healthy participants for the recruitment of areas associated with executive function with increased task demands, we employed a task difficulty manipulation in two counting tasks performed intraoperatively. Following surgery, the data were extracted and analyzed offline to identify increases in broadband high-gamma power with increased task difficulty, equivalent to fMRI findings, as a signature of activity related to executive function. All three patients performed the tasks well. Data were recorded from five electrode strips, resulting in data from 15 channels overall. Eleven out of the 15 channels (73.3%) showed significant increases in high-gamma power with increased task difficulty, 26.6% of the channels (4/15) showed no change in power, and none of the channels showed power decrease.

21414330,Implicit attitudes in prosopagnosia.,"Knutson, Kristine M; DeTucci, Karen A; Grafman, Jordan",Knutson,"We studied a male with acquired prosopagnosia using a battery of Implicit Association Tests (IATs) to investigate whether observing faces varying by social category would activate the patient's implicit social biases. We also asked him to categorize faces explicitly by race, gender, and political party. The patient, G.B., was marginally slower to categorize black compared to white faces. He showed congruency effects in the race and celebrity IATs, but not in the gender or political IATs. These results indicate that G.B. possesses an implicit social sensitivity to certain facial stimuli despite an inability to overtly recognize familiar faces. The results demonstrate that social biases can be retrieved based on facial stimuli via pathways bypassing the fusiform gyri. Thus the IAT effect can be added to the list of covert recognition effects found in prosopagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.03.009,PMC3100369,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

To evaluate the utility of currently proposed clinical criteria for CTE and suggest improvements. We describe two well-characterized patients referred for evaluation of CTE and apply the four major proposed criteria for CTE. These criteria were further assessed in a cohort of patients referred to a neurobehavior clinic with or without a history of TBI. Without a CTE biomarker, the current criteria were of limited utility when applied to the two patient and the Neurobehavior cohort. Six items were extracted as potentially improving the clinical diagnosis of CTE: length of exposure to head impacts, a progressive course, specific psychiatric symptoms, frontal-executive dysfunction, parkinsonism and tremors, and targeted findings on neuroimaging. The prevention and neurorehabilitation of CTE depends on clinical diagnosis, but, without a biomarker, the clinical diagnosis of CTE remains difficult. This report suggests that clinical criteria for CTE may be greatly improved with emphasis on several critical historical and clinical correlates of CTE.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-182452,,Chronic traumatic encephalopathy; dementia; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

While still very important, advances in neuroimaging have expanded our armamentarium of cognitive evaluations to include assessments of findings in nonstroke anatomic distributions of disease. These efforts support comprehensive assessments of large-scale cerebral networks in cognitive neurology. A thorough and focused mental status examination is essential for the evaluation of patients with cognitive symptoms.

Neuropsychological assessments were administered before and after the surgery to analyse how the brain functions in the presence of two frontal gliomas that affect both hemispheres and reacts to a bilateral resection, which can brutally compromise the neuronal connectivity, progressively established during the infiltrating process. We showed that both the tumor infiltration and their bilateral resection did not lead to a ""frontal syndrome"" or a ""dysexecutive syndrome"" predicted by the localization models. However, a subtle fragility was observed in fine-grain language, memory and emotional skills.

The captain, together with a physician aboard and the next of kin, decided not to detour to north African or south European airports, but to continue flying to Frankfurt, Germany (final destination; remaining flight time 4 h), where an efficient transfer infrastructure and an advanced medical standard were presumed. At the hospital, the patient was successfully treated by means of catheter-based mechanical thrombus extraction. The patient was free of neurological deficits at discharge.

JL had severely impaired written word recognition but he was remarkably accurate in number tasks, albeit slower than normal. This suggests LvOT activation is necessary for efficient but not for accurate number decisions. Here we investigated how JL made accurate number decisions using fMRI; we compared JL's brain activation to that in healthy controls and in two patients with frontal lobe damage who, like JL, made slow but accurate responses in number tasks. For semantic relative to perceptual decisions on numbers, JL did not activate the left occipito-temporal area that was involved in all other subjects. However, JL had significantly increased activation in a left posterior middle temporal region. In addition, during semantic and perceptual decisions on numbers, JL showed increased activation in: (1) the right occipito-temporal cortex, (2) right caudate, and (3) bilateral frontal regions. These effects were unique to JL and cannot be explained in terms of abnormally long response times because they were not observed in the other patients who made slow but accurate number decisions. Together these results show that although the LvOT usually contributes to efficient number processing, activation in this region is not essential for accurate performance because (i) perceptual processing of numbers can be supported by right occipital, right caudate, and bilateral frontal activation and (ii) semantic processing of numbers can be supported by increased left posterior middle temporal activation associated with hand actions.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2011.588179,PMC3396380,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

29635584,Olfactory Testing Informs the Decision Process to Obtain Advanced Neuroimaging in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Shih, Robert; Xydakis, Michael",Shih,"The purpose of this article is to examine the usefulness of olfactory testing as a tool for the evaluation or stratification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Olfactory dysfunction is more likely to be overlooked by both the patient and the provider, especially in the acute setting, in contrast to deficits in other senses like vision or hearing. This is a retrospective clinical analysis (case series) of eight active duty service members referred to ear, nose, and throat clinic at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center during a 2-yr period between March 2014 and March 2016 for subspecialist evaluation of suspected olfactory impairment after an exposure to closed head trauma. Advanced neuroimaging revealed evidence of frontal lobe injury in all eight patients, which was subtle and subcentimeter in half of the cases, best demonstrated with high-resolution imaging in the coronal plane. In this article, we discuss the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and brain pathology in both TBI and non-TBI settings. We then provide our recommendation for an orbit magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the inferior frontal lobes and olfactory bulbs in patients with unexplained anosmia.",{},,Military medicine,10.1093/milmed/usx178,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

TBI is a heterogeneous disorder that could be associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The clinical complexity of TBI patients requires a specialized and integrated approach that involves several rehabilitation experts (Mazzucchi in La riabilitazione neuropsicologica, Elsevier-Masson, Milan, 2012). SaM method (SaMM) (Risoli in La riabilitazione spaziale, Carocci Faber, Rome, 2013) is a new rehabilitation approach based on ""embodied cognition"" theory (Gallese and Lakoff in Cogn Neuropsychol 22(3):455-479, 2005) and has the aim to improve spatial abilities through structured body exercises. The patient was a 35-year-old male who had TBI 9 months before. The patient was evaluated, before and after the treatment, with neuropsychological tests (Rey Test copy and reproduction, Elithorn Test, Trail Making Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), Lawton Index for IADL, level of cognitive functioning, and a qualitative process-oriented assessment with SaMM exercises. The patient was treated with SaMM for 4 months, three times a week. Several of the executed assessments showed an improvement after SaMM treatment. The patient also reported amelioration in some daily activities such as swimming and using phone and money. Further investigations are necessary, but the SaMM appeared to be a useful complementary restitutive approach for TBI patients.",{},,Cognitive processing,10.1007/s10339-015-0676-y,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

The present research aimed to study neglect in situations where attentional resources are limited due to multitasking. We examined two patients more than 3 years after a right-hemispheric stroke. Both had received neuropsychological rehabilitation for left neglect and did not show any impairment in standard tests. We used a dual-task paradigm combining a peripheral target detection task with a central shape recognition task. Peripheral targets could appear in left/right positions but also in lower/upper positions. In patient #1, dual-task condition exacerbated left neglect and extinction. Patient #2 did not show any sign of neglect along the horizontal axis, but omitted half of the lower targets when they were presented simultaneously with upper targets under dual-task condition. This behavior reflects altitudinal extinction as the detection of single targets appearing either in upper or lower position was preserved. The present findings show that dual-tasking is a sensitive tool for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of spatial attention deficits, which are often overlooked by standard methods, especially in chronic stage.

We report a patient with TBI who demonstrated problematic behavior in situations of risk and complexity after cerebral injury from a traffic accident. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was used to reveal his deficits in the decision-making process. To examine underlying deficits of the network of brain areas, we examined T1-weighted structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tc-ECD SPECT in this patient. The patient showed abnormality in IGT. DTI-MRI results showed a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fasciculus between the brain stem and cortical regions via the thalamus. He showed significant decrease in gray matter volumes in the bilateral insular cortex, hypothalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex, possibly reflecting Wallerian degeneration secondary to the fasciculus abnormalities. SPECT showed significant blood flow decrease in the broad cortical areas including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VM). Our study showed that the patient had dysfunctional decision-making process. Microstructural abnormality in the fasciculus, likely from the traffic accident, caused reduced afferent feedback to the brain, resulting in less efficient decision-making. Our findings support the somatic-marker hypothesis (SMH), where somatic feedback to the brain influences the decision-making process.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2013.11.005,,Decision-maiking process; Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Somatic-marker hypothesis; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); Voxel-based morphometry (VBM),Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The first case is an asymptomatic 65-year-old woman who presented with an AComA aneurysm, and the pre-procedure high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an AComA aneurysm compressed the left optic nerve and the chiasma with a size of 8.3 × 9.2 mm. She suffered a sudden onset of left eye visual loss and the temporal hemianopia of the right eye after endovascular embolization. She had a light sensation of the left eye and minor enlargement of the visual field in the right eye at the six-month follow-up. The second case is a symptomatic 55-year-old woman suffering a visual loss in the left eye and inferior nasal quadrantanopsia in her right eye. Pre-operative high-resolution MRI found an AComA aneurysm compressing the left part of the chiasma with a size of 7.1 × 8.3 mm. Her visual symptoms improved after surgical clipping. High-resolution MRI could depict the anatomic relationship between the AComA aneurysm and the surrounding optic pathways. Endovascular treatment of an AComA aneurysm may result in visual deterioration due to the mass effect or ischemia after the procedure.

24499376,Losing control of your languages: a case study.,"Calabria, Marco; Marne, Paula; Romero-Pinel, Lucía; Juncadella, Montserrat; Costa, Albert",Calabria,"Bilingual speakers are usually quite good at restricting their lexicalization output to the desired language while preventing all sorts of language intrusions from the language not in use. However, brain damage can affect these abilities of language control, leading to striking and flagrant linguistic behaviours, such as pathological language mixing (pLM) and pathological switching (pLS). In this paper we report the performance of a Catalan-Spanish bilingual individual (R.R.T.) who, due to a neuroinflammatory disease and subcortical lesions, shows pLS. We tested R.R.T. in several tasks of language production and control, such as picture naming (objects and actions), word translation, blocked naming, and language switching task. R.R.T. was also tested in executive control (EC) tasks, such as task switching and a flanker task. We found several interesting results. First, cross-language intrusions were present much more frequently when R.R.T. was asked to speak in her first (and dominant) language (Catalan) than when she was asked to do so in the nondominant language (Spanish). Second, the results provide evidence suggesting that damage to certain subcortical structures may lead to problems in controlling the language output during verbalization in bilingual speakers. Third, we observed that R.R.T. seemed to show more difficulties in language control with verbs. Fourth, R.R.T. showed impaired performance compared to controls in both task switching and a flanker task. The results are discussed in relation to other findings of pLM and pLS in published single-case reports and in relation to EC deficits.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643294.2013.879443,,Bilingualism; Neuroinflammatory and progressive disease.; Pathological language switching,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks. With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area. As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.

24438798,Atypical cerebral language dominance in a right-handed patient: An anatomoclinical study.,"De Witte, Elke; Van Hecke, Wim; Dua, Guido; De Surgeloose, Didier; Moens, Maarten; Mariën, Peter",De Witte,"Approximately 97% of the right-handers has left hemisphere language dominance. Within the language dominant hemisphere Broca's area is of crucial importance for a variety of linguistic functions. As a result, tumour resection in and around Broca's area is controversial. However, studies showed that by means of Direct Electrical Stimulation (DES) tumour resection in this region can be safely performed. We report unexpected anatomoclinical findings in a right-handed patient who underwent tumour resection in the left prefrontal lobe. Language functions in this right-handed patient were extensively examined in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phase by means of a standardised battery of neurolinguistic and neurocognitive tests. Results obtained in the pre- and postoperative phase are compared. In addition, intraoperative DES findings and postoperative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) results are reported. Tumour resection near Broca's area was safely performed since no positive language sites were found during intraoperative DES. Since no linguistic deficits occurred in the pre-, intra-, or postoperative phase, atypical language dominance was suspected. Neuropsychological investigations, however, disclosed permanent executive dysfunction. Postoperative fMRI and DTI confirmed right cerebral language dominance as well as a crossed cerebro-cerebellar functional link with the left cerebellar hemisphere. Atypical right hemisphere language dominance in this right-handed patient is reflected by: (1) the total absence of language problems in the pre-, intra- and postoperative phase, (2) absence of positive stimulation sites during DES, (3) a clearly more pronounced arcuate fasciculus in the right cerebral hemisphere (DTI), (4) a crossed functional connection between the right cerebrum and the left cerebellum (fMRI). Two hypothetical explanations for the pattern of crossed cerebral language dominance are put forward: (1) preoperative brain plasticity mechanisms inducing a shift of language functions to the right hemisphere or (2) right hemisphere language dominance as a maturational variant. This case with atypical cerebral language dominance shows that although DES is the 'gold standard' to identify eloquent language regions and their pathways, fMRI and DTI are important adjuncts to guide surgery, to identify language lateralisation and to study anatomoclinical correlations.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2013.11.014,,Atypical language dominance; Awake craniotomy; Broca's area; Crossed dominance; Direct Electrical Stimulation; Language mapping; fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Netherlands,eng

However, current cognitive intervention programs directed to favor the training of specific domains individually have shown controversial results. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neuropsychological rehabilitation program directed to favor training of attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning together in a patient with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)-associated DAI. A 26-year-old Hispanic woman with a recent history of a severe TBI attended our center complaining of memory problems, dysarthria, and difficulty in planning. A comprehensive cognitive assessment revealed dysfunction in sustained, selective, and divided attention, alterations in memory, planning, and organization of executive behavior, as well as impairment of visuospatial cognitive functions. The patient underwent a 24-week neuropsychological rehabilitation program directed to favor attention, memory, visuospatial abilities, and executive functioning together. After the cognitive intervention, we observed a better patient's performance in tasks requiring sustained, selective, and divided attention, improvement of encoding and retrieval memory problems, use of spatial relationships, planning, and organization of behavior skills. We also observed generalization effects on other domains, such as learning, mental flexibility, inhibition functions, and language. In conclusion, our results suggest that neuropsychological rehabilitation programs favoring multiple domains together are useful in reestablishing cognitive deficits in patients with severe DAI.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of medical case reports,10.1186/s13256-020-02591-7,PMC7847025,Cognitive impairment; Cognitive rehabilitation; Diffuse axonal injury; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In particular, the functional contribution of subcortical regions to PM is still unknown. This study was aimed at investigating the role of the medial subdivision of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (mMDT) in PM, with particular focus on the processes that are mediated by the projections from/to this structure. We analysed the performance of a patient (OG) with a right-sided lesion involving the mMDT in a series of PM tasks that varied for focality (i.e., overlapping of processes for the PM and ongoing tasks) and emotional valence of the stimuli, comparing the patient's performance with that of a control group. We found that the mMDT damage led to deficits in PM that were modulated by focality and emotional valence. OG indeed showed: a greater cost in the ongoing performance when a non-focal PM task was added; a slowing down in retrieving the intentions, in particular when these were associated with focal PM cues; an abnormal performance in the task with positive PM cues. Our findings provide evidence of a contribution of mMDT to PM and suggest a modulation of prefrontal-dependent strategic monitoring and a possible interaction with the limbic structures in the integration of emotion and PM processes. They also give support to the still controversial idea that connections with the perirhinal cortex mediate familiarity-based recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1111/jnp.12154,,emotion; focality; mediodorsal thalamus; prospective memory; recognition,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The client developed seizures following an episode of mycoplasma encephalitis at the age of 7. The client underwent a left temporal lobectomy involving resection of the left mesial temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, and part of the brain stem 6 years prior to the current evaluation, in an attempt to address the frequency of the seizures. The surgery was extensive, including neocortical resection extending posterior to the vein of Labbe along the inferior temporal gyrus. The lobectomy reportedly successfully eliminated the seizures and the need for anti-seizure medications, but no neurological or neuropsychological follow-up occurred until 2009 when he was referred by his academic program for an evaluation of learning disabilities. Results of the neuropsychological evaluation indicated significant expressive language functioning deficits, with generally better-preserved receptive language. However, compared to a pre-surgical neuropsychological evaluation there was evidence for subtle to mild improvement in several aspects of cognitive functioning, likely due to seizure elimination and discontinuation of the anti-seizure medication. Nonetheless, his deficits resulted in significant functional impact on his academic abilities, thus implications for academic intervention were discussed.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,The Clinical neuropsychologist,10.1080/13854046.2010.486008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

There is much overlap between neurocognitive disorders due to frontotemporal dementia and other subcortical dementia. A less known diagnosis, cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), should also be considered. <i>Case History</i>. A 29-year-old female presented with ataxia and left-sided weakness. CSF showed oligoclonal bands, and MRI showed multiple white matter lesions with some atrophy. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). At age 35, she developed frontal lobe symptoms and executive dysfunction; she was diagnosed with MS with bipolar disorder. Neuropsychological evaluation at that time showed significant deficits in multiple cognitive domains. Subsequent MRI showed progressive frontotemporal atrophy, and FDG-PET uncovered hypometabolism in the frontotemporal lobes and cerebellum. At age 38, her behavior worsened with aggression, and she was started on olanzapine. She responded well with decreased agitation and improved motivation and attention. Compared with previous scans, most recent MRI and FDG-PET showed interval increase in cerebellar atrophy with increase in hypometabolism in the cerebellum, respectively. Based on cerebellar, affective, and subcortical cognitive examination findings, our diagnosis is probable CCAS.

We report this phenomenon in a 33 yr-old, right-handed man (JG) in association with the extension in the right thalamus of a previously small, bilateral thalamic lesion. JG presented with a dense amnesia for autobiographical material more than a few years old, with some sparing of recent memories. Furthermore, he was completely unable to recognise famous people or world events. Many other aspects of semantic knowledge were intact and there was no evidence of general intellectual impairment, executive dysfunction or loss of visual imagery. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute lesion in the right thalamus and two small, symmetrical, bilateral non-acute thalamic lesions. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment indicated a stable pattern of impaired retrograde and spared anterograde memory over 18 months and psychiatric assessments yielded no evidence of confabulation, malingering or other symptoms to suggest psychogenic amnesia. JG's profile indicates that the division of declarative memory into just two categories - episodic and semantic - is inadequate. Rather, his case adds to the growing body evidence to suggest that world knowledge pertaining to people and events is stored or accessed similarly to autobiographical information and differently from other types of more general factual knowledge. We hypothesize that the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and immediately surrounding regions comprise the central processing mechanism referred to by McClelland (Revue Neurologique, 150 (1994) 570) and Markowitsch (Brain Research Review, 21 (1995) 117) as responsible for inducing and co-ordinating the recall of these sorts of cortically stored memory engrams.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00041-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

19637100,Acquired personality traits of autism following damage to the medial prefrontal cortex.,"Umeda, Satoshi; Mimura, Masaru; Kato, Motoichiro",Umeda,"Recent neuroimaging studies on ""theory of mind"" have demonstrated that the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved when subjects are engaged in various kinds of mentalising tasks. Although a large number of neuroimaging studies have been published, a relatively small amount of neuropsychological evidence supports involvement of the medial PFC in theory of mind reasoning. We recruited two neurological cases with damage to the medial PFC and initially performed the standard neuropsychological assessments for intelligence, memory, and executive functions. To examine theory of mind performance in these two cases, four kinds of standard and advanced tests for theory of mind were used, including first- and second-order false belief tests, the strange stories test, and the faux pas recognition test. Both patients were also requested to complete the questionnaire for the autism-spectrum quotient. Neither case showed impairment on standard theory of mind tests and only mild impairments were seen on advanced theory of mind tests. This pattern of results is basically consistent with previous studies. The most interesting finding was that both cases showed personality changes after surgical operations, leading to characteristics of autism showing a lack of social interaction in everyday life. We discuss herein the possible roles of the medial PFC and emphasize the importance of using multiple approaches to understand the mechanisms of theory of mind and medial prefrontal functions.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Social neuroscience,10.1080/17470910902990584,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Brain imaging may play a pivotal role in determining the etiology as it did for the case presented here. A new case of central nervous system (CNS) SLE is presented along with an analysis of 33 comparable cases from the scientific literature. A 70-year-old female with subacute cutaneous lupus presented to a university-based geropsychiatry program after 1 year of benign visual hallucinations and several months of shuffling gait, recurrent falls, and forgetfulness. These symptoms were highly suggestive of Lewy body dementia; however, the patient's history of basal ganglia infarct, cognitive testing demonstrating inattention and executive dysfunction, and follow-up brain imaging, which did not reveal acute findings, aligned with cerebral pathology previously attributed to vasculitis and supported the diagnosis of subcortical dementia due to SLE-CNS vasculitis. Oral prednisone 20 mg daily resolved her symptoms. Over the next 19 months, her prednisone was tapered completely and her symptoms did not return. A systematic literature search identified 33 comparable cases. An analysis of previously published cases suggests that extending the duration of the prednisone taper beyond 1 year may decrease the risk of later occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms in this patient population.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,10.1177/0891988720901788,,Lewy body dementia; case report; lymphocytic angiitis; psychosis; systemic lupus erythematosus; vasculitis,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

HE has been previously discussed as a differential diagnosis for rapid progressive dementia. However, most of these patients suffered from additional neurological symptoms, like ataxia or seizures. Here, we present the case of a 59-year-old female patient suffering rapid onset dementia with salient frontal executive dysfunction. She developed rapid onset symptoms, including apathy, verbal depletion up to a stuporous state, severe working memory deficits, evidence of primitive reflexes, disturbed Luria's three-step test, and micturition disorder. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid was normal. The serum analyses showed increased antithyroid (antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin) antibodies. In the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, supratentorial deep and peripheral white matter lesions were found; the electroencephalography showed intermittent slowing, and the [<sup>18</sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) depicted medial and superior dorsolateral frontal hypometabolism. Several different psychopharmacological therapeutic approaches with various neuroleptics, antidepressants, and high doses of lorazepam were unsuccessful. Due to the organic alterations, including increased antithyroid antibodies, HE was suspected. Against expectations, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids proved to be ineffective and was associated with worsening symptoms. However, escalated treatment with plasmapheresis over 5 days led to significant improvement in all reported symptoms and in psychometric testing. The neuropsychological improvement was stable over a 6-month follow-up period, and the FDG-PET normalized. This case report reveals that (1) HE can mimic rapid onset dementia with predominantly frontal dysfunction; (2) this syndrome can be successfully treated in the context of HE; and (3) plasmapheresis can be effective in such a disease constellation. The detection of the immunological causes of rapid onset dementia and other psychiatric syndromes is important because it opens opportunities for new, innovative immunosuppressive treatment options.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00212,PMC5662557,Hashimoto’s encephalopathy; SREAT; frontotemporal dementia; plasmapheresis; thyroid,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

MS is considered a type of ""subcortical dementia"" in which cognitive and behavioral abnormalities resemble those observed in patients with a frontal lobe syndrome. The Bicycle Drawing Test is employed for the neuropsychological assessment of cognitive impairment specifically that of mechanical reasoning and visuographic functioning. It also provides clues concerning the patient's organizational skills which are subserved by the frontal lobes. Extracerebral pulsed applications of picotesla flux intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been shown to improve cognitive functions in patients with MS. I present three patients with long standing symptoms of MS who, on the initial baseline, pretreatment Bicycle Drawing Test, exhibited cognitive impairment manifested by omissions of essential details and deficient organizational skills. All patients demonstrated progressive improvement in their performance during treatment with EMFs lasting from 6-18 months. The improvement in cognitive functions, which occurred during the initial phases of the treatment, was striking for the changes in organizational skills reflecting frontal lobe functions. These findings demonstrate that progressive recovery of cognitive functions in MS patients are observed over time through continued administration of picotesla flux intensity EMFs. It is believed that the beneficial cognitive effects of these EMFs are related to increased synaptic neurotransmission and that the progressive cognitive improvement noted in these patients is associated with slow recovery of synaptic functions in monoaminergic neurons of the frontal lobe or its projections from subcortical areas.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459708988463,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In neurological clinics, the state of impairment of executive functions goes unnoticed in the examinations and interviews carried out. For this reason, the objective of this study was to describe the executive function of a 59-year-old adult neurocancer patient. This study is novel in integrating and demonstrating biological effects and outcomes in performance evaluated by a neuropsychological instrument and psychological interviews. For this purpose, pre- and post-evaluations were carried out of neurological and neuropsychological functioning through neuroimaging techniques (iRM, spectroscopy, electroencephalography), hospital medical history, psychological interviews, and the Wisconsin Card Classification Test (WCST). There was evidence of deterioration in executive performance, as evidenced by the increase in perseverative scores, failure to maintain one's attitude, and an inability to learn in relation to clinical samples. This information coincides with the evolution of neuroimaging over time. Our case shows that the presence of the tumor is associated with alterations in executive functions that are not very evident in clinical interviews or are explicit in neuropsychological evaluations.

Three criteria were manipulated to make relevant and irrelevant tools (size, rigidity, shape). LBD patients selected a greater number of irrelevant tools and had more difficulties to solve the task compared to RBD patients and controls. All participants committed more errors for selecting relevant tools based on rigidity and shape than size. In some LBD patients, the difficulties persisted even in the 2-Choice condition. Our findings confirm that tool use disorders result from impaired technical reasoning, leading patients to meet difficulties in selecting tools based on their physical properties.

(99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion mostly in the ipsilateral striatum, dorsolateral, and orbitofrontal cortex. This case study adds pathological generosity to the range of behavioral changes that may result from discrete unilateral lesions of the lenticular nucleus and nearby pathways. In our particular case, post-stroke pathological generosity was not ascribable to disinhibition, apathy, mania, or depression. Because pathological generosity may lead to significant distress and financial burden upon patients and their families, it may warrant further consideration as a potential type of impulse control disorder.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2013.826681,,Basal ganglia; Frontal lobe syndrome; Generosity; Impulse control disorder; Stroke,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Computed tomography of the head and brain single photon emission tomography with IMP was also carried out. Her performance on neuropsychologic testing was within the normal range, except for the gambling task. Computed tomography of the head showed low-density areas in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, basal forebrain, and right ventromedial caudate.

Words from three categories, action verbs, nouns with strong visual associations and nouns with both strong action and visual associations, were presented in a lexical decision task. The stimulus categories were matched for word length and frequency. In both patients, responses to action verbs were slowed and/or less accurate compared with the other word categories. This was so even in the patient with a minor lesion in the motor, pre-motor and somatosensory areas of the hand representation. Control subjects did not show category differences when tested with the same stimulus materials. These results are consistent with the view that the cortical areas involved in the programming of body movements, even those in the hemisphere not dominant for language, specifically contribute to and are necessary for the processing of words referring to such movements. As an alternative, the affected brain areas may be of particular relevance for the processing of words from the lexical category of verbs.

Twenty neurologically intact controls also provided normative scores on the IGT. Patient A and patient B had high scores for apathy and low depressive symptoms scores. Patient A had relatively intact performance on standard executive function tests, but patient B had significant impairments. Both patients were significantly impaired on the IGT.

This has resulted in decreasing referrals for surgical management under the guise of ""evidence-based"" medicine. The conclusions drawn from a study can only be as good as the selected end points. COSS did not consider important end points such as the effects of long-term cerebral ischemia or recurrent debilitating transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). However, the study is often quoted as ""proof"" that EC-IC bypass has no role in the treatment of these patients. A middle-aged patient presented to a primary neurologist with left-sided weakness and 2 months of personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed small watershed infarcts in the right hemisphere. An angiogram showed right carotid occlusion. Perfusion scans confirmed hypoperfusion. The patient was managed medically. Without any further clinical stroke events, the patient progressed to complete hemispheric infarction on MRI over the next 5 months. The public perception of the results of large randomized clinical trials is significantly altered by their ubiquitous dissemination and broad generalization without adequate understanding of the details. Careful assessment of the methodology and end points of a trial are essential when applying the results for evidence-based medicine to individual patients.

To investigate the possible consequences of such lesions on social cognition, we tested a selected patient, MVG, a 44-year-old man with a focal caudate nucleus (CN) lesion following stroke. In the aftermath of this stroke, MVG shows loss of empathy and difficulties recognizing emotions in others. The dual aims of this study were first, to evaluate the implications of CN on ToM and recognition of emotion, and second, to discuss these results as a consequence of a disconnection of the sub-cortical orbito-frontal (OF) loop due to caudate damage. We performed a complete neuropsychological assessment of MVG, as well as different tasks evaluating social cognition, such as the Faux-Pas Test and the Reading the Eyes in the Mind Test. No deficits were found in the neuropsychological tests. However, on tasks assessing social cognition, MVG showed impairments in the ""warm"" or ""affective"" part of ToM as well as in the ability to recognize negative emotions (i.e., sadness and fear). These results indicate that damage to the head of the left CN can lead to impairment of ToM and emotion recognition. Furthermore, the data shows that, in MVG, such impairment appears to be due to a disconnection of the sub-cortical OF circuit resulting from damage to the CN. Neuro-imaging data tends to confirm this hypothesis by bringing out a hypo-perfusion in both, the territory of his left CN and prefrontal (i.e., ventromedial) brain areas.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.01.004,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Unfortunately, these tests were never designed to assess the neurobehavioral symptoms of these patients and are poor at doing this. Neuropsychologists typically spend relatively little time with brain-damaged patients because they often rely on questionnaires that are completed by the patient rather than take a comprehensive face-to-face clinical history and assistants who administer neuropsychological tests. The ecological validity of the neuropsychological tests that are administered to these patients is frequently ignored. As a consequence, neuropsychologists often base their predictions about whether these patients can work, return to school, or function independently in the community on the patient's quantitative test scores that were never designed for this purpose and have little ecological validity. Although patients with frontal-lobe damage may not show any cognitive deficits when they are administered standardized neuropsychological tests in an office setting, particularly when the anterior and ventral areas of their frontal lobes are damaged, they frequently exhibit cognitive difficulties, neurobehavioral symptoms, and executive dysfunction in unstructured real-world settings. Because standardized neuropsychological tests are generally poor at assessing these problems and symptoms, neuropsychologists may not be aware that a patient has these symptoms if they rely solely on their neuropsychological test results-particularly if they have never observed these patients function in real-world settings or interviewed the significant others of these patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Applied neuropsychology.

Both cases had a very poor prognosis and end-of-life discussions were commenced by the treating team in the acute phase. Despite the severity of their conditions, in neither case were end-of-life discussions well tolerated by the family in the weeks following admission. We suggest that LIS patients and their families, who have chosen to persist with full medical management after diagnosis of LIS, should be provided with sufficient time to adjust to the catastrophic changes that have occurred before further end-of-life discussions are pursued. Education and support are likely to be highly beneficial in the acute period post stroke as they allow the patient and family to develop a realistic understanding of the likely outcomes of their decisions.",{},,Internal medicine journal,10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.01957.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

16532698,[A case of left dorsomedial thalamic infarction with unilateral schizophrenia-like auditory hallucinations].,"Yoshida, Yukihiro; Abe, Koji; Yoshizawa, Kikuko",Yoshida,"We report a case of a right-handed, 73-year-old woman with auditory hallucinations lateralized to the right ear. A brain MRI revealed a small infarction in the left dorsomedial nucleus (DM) of the thalamus. The patient did not have either psychiatric or neurological prior history, and had otherwise been treated for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia for 10 years. Two months prior to admission, she had become forgetful, and had lost her wallet several times. She concurrently began to experience auditory hallucinations in which she heard the voices of her acquaintances, or ""the gods"". She frequently monologized and wandered about outside following the contents of the hallucinations. Therefore, she was admitted to our institution. On admission, no apparent abnormalities were revealed by physical examinations or blood analyses. She was alert and had no aphasic symptoms. Except for memory disturbances, no neurological symptoms, including no hearing loss, were found. A brain MRI showed a small localized infarction in the left DM, but EEG findings were normal. The patient had prominent anterograde memory deficits: she hardly remembered what she had done the very same day, or the names of the doctor and hospital. She also demonstrated a retrograde amnesia of the past decade or two: she showed difficulty recalling either personal history or social events that occurred during this era. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) revealed a total IQ of 75 (verbal IQ 77; performance IQ 77). The verbal hallucinations continued with frequent occurrence even after admission. They included voices telling her about misfortunes, such as death or sickness, of her relatives. These turned into threats and commands, such as ""I'm gonna kill ya. I attack you from behind. You, do not eat!"" In addition, she occasionally experienced ""third person auditory hallucination"", in which several men were discussing the plan to kill her. As is characteristic of this type of case, the hallucinations always appeared in only her right ear. They did not occur in the other modalities (e.g. as a visual one). She was convinced that the hallucinations were real and looked frightened while they were happening. Whereas the anterograde amnesia continued for 6 months after admission, the retrograde amnesia gradually improved within 2 or 3 months after admission, although a partial amnesia on the past decade eventually turned out to persistent. On the other hand, the hallucinations did not ameliorate satisfactorily with risperidone (3-6 mg/day), but on augmentation with olanzapine (5-20 mg/day), they lessened gradually and almost disappeared within 6 months. She also slowly developed symptoms similar to those of frontal lobe syndrome, i.e., aspontaneity and apathy. In conclusion, our case indicates the importance of DM on memory function. It is noteworthy that schizophrenia-like hallucinations developed in the case. Localized neuronal deficits evoked by infarction in the left DM probably caused the schizophrenia-like hallucinations; the lateralization phenomenon further indicates the involvement of specific neuronal mechanisms in the mediation of the hallucinations. According to the knowledge of the functional anatomy of the DM and the lateralization phenomenon of auditory hallucinations, it is possible that the neuronal loop, comprised of the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, designated as ""basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits"", in addition to the left temporal cortex, plays an important role in the development of the hallucinations in this case.

21807010,Numbers and time doubly dissociate.,"Cappelletti, Marinella; Freeman, Elliot D; Cipolotti, Lisa",Cappelletti,"The magnitude dimensions of number, time and space have been suggested to share some common magnitude processing, which may imply symmetric interaction among dimensions. Here we challenge these suggestions by presenting a double dissociation between two neuropsychological patients with left (JT) and right (CB) parietal lesions and selective impairment of number and time processing respectively. Both patients showed an influence of task-irrelevant number stimuli on time but not space processing. In JT otherwise preserved time processing was severely impaired in the mere presence of task-irrelevant numbers, which themselves could not be processed accurately. In CB, impaired temporal estimation was influenced by preserved number processing: small numbers made (already grossly underestimated) time intervals appear even shorter relative to large numbers. However, numerical estimation was not influenced by time in healthy controls and in both patients. This new double dissociation between number and time processing and the asymmetric interaction of number on time: (1) provides further support to the hypothesis of a partly shared magnitude system among dimensions, instead of the proposal of a single, fully shared system or of independent magnitude systems which would not explain dissociations or interactions among dimensions; (2) may be explained in terms of a stable hierarchy of dimensions, with numbers being the strongest.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.014,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
32320849,From correlational approaches to meta-analytical symptom reading in individual patients: Bilateral lesions in the inferior frontal junction specifically cause dysexecutive syndrome.,"Schroeter, Matthias L; Eickhoff, Simon B; Engel, Annerose",Schroeter,"Executive functions describe a wide variety of higher order cognitive processes allowing the modification of thought and behavior in response to changing contexts. Recent comprehensive quantitative and systematic meta-analyses on functional imaging studies in healthy subjects identified the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), located at the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and the inferior precentral sulcus, as essential for executive functions. Lesion studies in patients are necessary for confirmation of this finding. We present, as a proof of concept, a 56 year old woman with bilateral ischemic lesions in the IFJ caused by multiple stroke-related brain infarcts in the bilateral territory of the middle cerebral artery. Comprehensive neuropsychological testing revealed specific deficits in executive functions, namely working memory, task switching, inhibitory control, interference resolution, fluency, and complex executive function tests focusing on action planning and problem solving abilities. Memory functions were within the normal range. Furthermore, we applied comprehensive meta-analyses to validate the importance of the IFJ for executive functions. (i) Lesions in the patient's brain in the IFJ coincide with regional activation in functional imaging studies for working memory, task switching, and the Stroop task. (ii) Lesions in the patient's IFJ should affect a frontoparietal network as shown with connectivity analyses. (iii) We introduce a new analysis tool - Meta-Analytical Reading of Symptoms (MARS) - that enables prediction of clinical symptoms from imaging data in individual patients. Our study confirms the importance of the IFJ as the causal agent, in a frontoparietal network, for dysexecutive syndrome. As a lesion study, it goes beyond correlational imaging approaches. The new meta-analytical symptom reading approach can be applied in other patients and diseases. It has a high potential to foster individualized diagnosis and therapy in clinical settings in the framework of personalized medicine.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.03.010,,BrainMap; Executive functions; Inferior frontal junction; Lesion study; Meta-analysis; Neurosynth; meta-Analytical symptom reading,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

The first painter, who showed mild visual-perceptive difficulties (dyschromatopsia and scotoma in his right upper visual field after left occipital stroke), together with increased anxiety and difficulty in emotional control, switched to a more stylised and symbolic art. The second painter, who also presented features of emotionalism related to his left latero-thalamic stroke, switched from an impressionist style to a more joyous and geometric, but more simplistic, abstract art.

However, the utilization of tracheostomy or extubation after a withdrawal of treatment decision is debated. There is a dearth of practical information available to aid clinical decision making because withdrawal of treatment is a challenging scenario for all concerned. This is further complicated by medicolegal and ethical considerations. Care of the ""hopelessly ill"" patient should be based on daily evaluation and comfort making it impossible to fit into general algorithms. Although respect for autonomy is important in healthcare, it is limited for patients in an unconscious state. Beneficence remains the basis for withdrawing treatment in futile cases and underpins the ""doctrine of double effect."" This article presents a relevant clinical case of hypoxic brain injury where a question of withdrawal of treatment arose and examines the ethical, clinical, and medicolegal considerations inherent in such cases, including beneficence, nonmaleficence, and the ""sanctity of life doctrine."" In addition, the considerations of prognosis for recovery, patient autonomy, patient quality of life, and patient family involvement, which are central to decision making, are addressed. The varying legal frameworks that exist internationally regarding treatment withdrawal are also described. Good ethics needs sound facts, and despite the lack of legal foundation in several countries, withdrawal of treatment remains practiced, and the principles described within this article aim to aid clinician decision making during such complex and multifaceted end-of-life decisions.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Journal of critical care,10.1016/j.jcrc.2009.08.007,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

In addition to prompting specific activities, we aimed to support completion of more general goals (those that could be enacted within a wider window of time).

DBS has also been used to treat dystonia, essential tremor (progressive neurological condition causing trembling), chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, major depressive disorder, obesity, cerebral palsy, and the minimally conscious state. Although the underlying mechanisms of the technique are still not clear, DBS can modulate underactive or overactive neural circuits and restore disrupted communication between and among groups of neurons in interacting regions of the brain.This can control and relieve many symptoms associated with a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. But the procedures of implanting and stimulating the electrodes are brain-invasive and entail significant risks. Some patients receiving DBS have experienced intracerebral hemorrhage, infection, cognitive disturbances such as impulsive behavior, and affective disturbances such as mania. It is not known whether continuous electrical stimulation of the brain would reshape synaptic connectivity and permanently alter neural circuits in ways that may not be salutary. The risk of these effects indicates that DBS should be used only when a patient's condition is refractory to all other interventions and when there is a high probability that the technique will benefit the patient and improve his or her quality of life. If a patient's quality of life is poor and all other treatment options have been exhausted, then the likelihood of benefit can justify physicians' exposing patients to some risk. The clinical and ethical significance of the risk in DBS underscores the obligation of physicians to obtain fully informed consent from patients undergoing the procedure.",{},,The Journal of clinical ethics,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

In recent years, the use of behaviour modification techniques, particularly the use of positive reinforcement and time-out, has been increasingly reported in the literature as a means of remediating behaviour disturbance in this population.

Two successive treatment programmes that were used in an attempt to satiate shouting are presented. Significant reductions in both the frequency and duration of shouting were found, enabling physical and functional gains to be made through successful participation in previously avoided rehabilitation activities.

Outcome was assessed with specific working memory tests (spans, Brown Peterson, n-back), non-specific cognitive tasks requiring working memory (dual-task, arithmetic solving problem), an ecological questionnaire to assess generalization to everyday life and non-target tasks not requiring working memory, to assess the specificity of the therapy. Performance was stable on two baseline sessions before therapy.

How clinicians support decision-making participation after acquired brain injury.,"Knox, Lucy; Douglas, Jacinta M; Bigby, Christine",Knox,"To raise professional awareness of factors that may influence the support offered by clinicians to people with acquired brain injury (ABI), and to consider the potential implications of these factors in terms of post-injury rehabilitation and living. A review of the literature was conducted to identify factors that determine how clinicians provide support and influence opportunities for individuals with ABI to participate in decision making across the rehabilitation continuum. Clinical case studies are used to highlight two specific issues: (1) hidden assumptions on the part of the practitioner, and (2) perceptions of risk operating in clinical practice. There are a range of factors which may influence the decision-making support provided by clinicians and, ultimately, shape lifetime outcomes for individuals with ABI. A multidimensional framework may assist clinicians to identify relevant factors and consider their potential implications including those that influence how clinicians involved in supporting decision making approach this task. Participation in decision making is an undisputed human right and central to the provision of person-centred care. Further research is required to understand how clinical practice can maximise both opportunities and support for increased decision-making participation by individuals with ABI. There is an increasing focus on the rights of all individuals to be supported to participate in decision making about their life. A number of changes associated with ABI mean that individuals with ABI will require support with decision making. Clinicians have a critical role in providing this support over the course of the rehabilitation continuum. Clinicians need to be aware of the range of factors that may influence the decision-making support they provide. A multidimensional framework may be used by clinicians to identify influences on the decision-making support they provide.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Disability and rehabilitation,10.3109/09638288.2013.766270,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

We report evidence from both low-level perceptual matching tasks and episodic memory showing that SC has a hypoself bias across the tasks. RR in contrast had a hyperself bias confined to perceptual matching. Both patients also showed hypobias effects for reward. We argue that the different brain lesions compromise (i) the use of a core self-representation which modulates both perceptual and memorial levels of processing (the vmPFC), and (ii) attentional responses to social cues (the TP cortex), and, furthermore, these effects can dissociate from those of reward and general effects of brain lesion and/or impaired executive control. We suggest that the vmPFC is critical for access to a core self-representation while TP damage can reduce top-down control of attention to salient stimuli and exaggerates the effects of strong (self-related) attentional signals.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.04.024,,Neuropsychology; Reward-bias; Self-bias; Self-representation,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

In the current study, two comparably rare patients with unilateral lesions to dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encompassing the ACC were assessed with neuropsychological tests as well as Event-Related Potentials in two experimental paradigms known to engage prefrontal cortex (PFC). These included an auditory Novelty Oddball task and a visual Stop-signal task. Both patients performed normally on the Stroop test but showed reduced performance on tests of learning and memory. Moreover, altered attentional control was reflected in a diminished Novelty P3, whereas the posterior P3b to target stimuli was present in both patients. The error-related negativity, which has been hypothesized to be generated in the ACC, was present in both patients, but alterations of inhibitory behavior were observed. Although interpretative caution is generally called for in single case studies, and the fact that the lesions extended outside the ACC, the findings nevertheless suggest a role for MPFC in cognitive control that is not restricted to error monitoring.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Brain and cognition,10.1016/j.bandc.2012.07.008,PMC4067454,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

We report here an oculomotor and computational study of a patient with a long lasting form of DD. A first series of oculomotor paradigms revealed marked and unprecedented saccade impairments. We used a computational model in order to provide information about the impaired decision-making process: the analysis of saccade latencies revealed that variations of decision times were explained by adjustments of response criterion. This result and paradoxical impairments observed in additional oculomotor paradigms allowed to propose that this adjustment of the criterion level resulted from the co-existence of counteracting oculomotor programs, consistent with the existence of antagonist programs in homotopic cortical areas. In the intact brain, trans-hemispheric inhibition would allow suppression of these counter programs. Depending on the topography of the disconnected areas, various motor and/or behavioural impairments would arise in split-brain subjects. In motor systems, such conflict would result in increased criteria for desired movement execution (oculomotor system) or in simultaneous execution of counteracting movements (skeletal motor system).

The amygdala is another structure that has been widely implicated in emotion processing and social decision-making, and the question arises as to whether the amygdala, in a manner akin to what has been observed for the prefrontal cortex, might have sex-related functional asymmetry in regard to social and emotional functions. A preliminary test of this question was carried out in the current study, where we used a case-matched lesion approach and contrasted a pair of men cases and a pair of women cases, where in each pair one patient had left amygdala damage and the other had right amygdala damage. We investigated the domains of social conduct, emotional processing and personality, and decision-making. The results provide support for the notion that there is sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala in regard to these functions - in the male pair, the patient with right-sided amygdala damage was impaired in these functions, and the patient with left-sided amygdala damage was not, whereas in the female pair, the opposite pattern obtained, with the left-sided woman being impaired and the right-sided woman being unimpaired. These data provide preliminary support for the notion that sex-related functional asymmetry of the amygdala may entail functions such as social conduct, emotional processing, and decision-making, a finding that in turn could reflect (as either a cause or effect) differences in the manner in which men and women apprehend, process, and execute emotion-related information.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790902775492,PMC2829120,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",England,eng

JD, a 30 year old male whose recurrent craniopharyngioma had 2 years earlier been treated with two operations and conventional radiotherapy. JD was assessed (using standardized clinical tests) before and after a course of stereotactic radiotherapy. Prior to stereotactic radiotherapy (and 2 years after microsurgery and conventional radiotherapy) JD's IQ was intact, but considerable impairments were present in executive functioning, memory, theory of mind and processing speed. Fifteen months after stereotactic radiotherapy, all neuropsychological domains remained largely static or improved, supporting the utility of this treatment option in the neuropsychological domain. However, deficits in executive functioning, memory and processing speed remained. These findings suggest that, even after multiple treatments, substantial cognitive impairments can be present in an adult patient with a recurrent craniopharyngioma. This profile of deficits underlines the inadequacy of relying purely on IQ as a marker for cognitive health in this population and emphasizes the need to include neuropsychological impairments as a focus of rehabilitation with these patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1104552,,Executive functioning; intelligence; memory; neuropsychological; outcome; surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This visual ability relies on a distributed network of brain regions and can be preserved even after damage of high-level ventral visual areas. However, it remains unknown whether this critical biological skill can withstand the loss of vision following bilateral striate damage. To address this question, we tested the categorization of human and animal biological motion in BC, a rare case of cortical blindness after anoxia-induced bilateral striate damage. The severity of his impairment, encompassing various aspects of vision (i.e., color, shape, face, and object recognition) and causing blind-like behavior, contrasts with a residual ability to process motion. We presented BC with static or dynamic point-light displays (PLDs) of human or animal walkers. These stimuli were presented either individually, or in pairs in two alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks. When confronted with individual PLDs, the patient was unable to categorize the stimuli, irrespective of whether they were static or dynamic. In the 2AFC task, BC exhibited appropriate eye movements towards diagnostic information, but performed at chance level with static PLDs, in stark contrast to his ability to efficiently categorize dynamic biological agents. This striking ability to categorize biological motion provided top-down information is important for at least two reasons. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of assessing patients' (visual) abilities across a range of task constraints, which can reveal potential residual abilities that may in turn represent a key feature for patient rehabilitation. Finally, our findings reinforce the view that the neural network processing biological motion can efficiently operate despite severely impaired low-level vision, positing our natural predisposition for processing dynamicity in biological agents as a robust feature of human vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.11.009,,Biological motion; Cortical blindness; Eye tracking; Residual visual ability; Striate damage; Task dependency,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The artery of Percheron, an asymmetrical common trunk arising from a P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, is a peculiar presentation of the three variants involved in the irrigation of the paramedian thalamic territory. Occlusion of this artery results in bilateral median thalamic infarction. The paramedian syndrome includes an acute loss or reduction of consciousness, often associated with oculomotor and neuropsychological disturbances. We present three cases of bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction with onset of acute coma, followed by fluctuations in the level of consciousness, memory, and behavioural alterations. A neuroradiological study with MRI identified individual thalamic nuclei, and a complete neuropsychological study was performed one month after onset of ictus. One of the patients showed severe memory and executive function impairments without improvement of vertical gaze palsy. The other two patients presented with mild executive dysfunction with complete resolution of neurological symptoms. Neuroimaging results showed a bilateral lesion of the dorsomedial nuclei in the three patients. Severe amnesia has been associated with an affection of the structures of the paramedian thalamic territory. Presently, the role of the dorsomedial nucleus remains controversial, with the suggestion that memory deficits observed in this type of lesion could be secondary to executive function deficits.

Psychopathological syndrome can be depression-type, pseudodepression syndrome or maniac-type, pseudomaniac syndrome. Surgical treatment of lesions like this may not always be possible due to their location in eloquent areas. In this study, we describe an unusual association of migraine-like headache, epilepsy and frontal lobe pseudodepression late-onset syndrome in the same patient. We have considered this case interesting mainly for the rarity of both a headache with migraine features and for the late onset of pseudodepression syndrome. Pathophysiology underlying migraine-like headache and that concerning the late-onset pseudodepression frontal lobe syndrome seems to be unclear.

26679327,Detecting and interpreting conscious experiences in behaviorally non-responsive patients.,"Naci, Lorina; Sinai, Leah; Owen, Adrian M",Naci,"Decoding the contents of consciousness from brain activity is one of the most challenging frontiers of cognitive neuroscience. The ability to interpret mental content without recourse to behavior is most relevant for understanding patients who may be demonstrably conscious, but entirely unable to speak or move willfully in any way, precluding any systematic investigation of their conscious experience. The lack of consistent behavioral responsivity engenders unique challenges to decoding any conscious experiences these patients may have solely based on their brain activity. For this reason, paradigms that have been successful in healthy individuals cannot serve to interpret conscious mental states in this patient group. Until recently, patient studies have used structured instructions to elicit willful modulation of brain activity according to command, in order to decode the presence of willful brain-based responses in this patient group. In recent work, we have used naturalistic paradigms, such as watching a movie or listening to an audio-story, to demonstrate that a common neural code supports conscious experiences in different individuals. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this code can be used to interpret the conscious experiences of a patient who had remained non-responsive for several years. This approach is easy to administer, brief, and does not require compliance with task instructions. Rather, it engages attention naturally through meaningful stimuli that are similar to the real-world sensory information in a patient's environment. Therefore, it may be particularly suited to probing consciousness and revealing residual brain function in highly impaired, acute, patients in a comatose state, thus helping to improve diagnostication and prognostication for this vulnerable patient group from the critical early stages of severe brain-injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,NeuroImage,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.11.059,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

During this surgical procedure, part of the skull is removed and the underlying dura mater is open, which can effectively release intracranial pressure. However, in some cases, the decision whether or not to remove the bone flap relies on the surgeon's personal experience. Positive decisions are usually made to avoid massive postoperative cerebral edema and infarction, which can lead to overtreatment. The procedure is related to many side-effects, which may affect the recovery of neurological function. Patients who have survived have to be anesthetized and undergo secondary cranioplasty 3 or 6 months later. Despite its technical simplicity, complications associated with cranioplasty are hard to ignore. Therefore, there is a need for a new surgical procedure combining decompressive craniectomy and cranioplasty. Acute expansion of the skin flap is limited, and the compensatory capacity of the skull after DC depends on the volume of the bone flap at the early stage. The titanium mesh is thin and strong, does not take up extra space provided by bone flap. Therefore, we put forward the concept of Decompressive Bone Flap Replacement. During this procedure, neurosurgeons resect the massive bone flap, open the dura mater, remove the hematoma in a similar manner to a standard craniotomy and then use titanium mesh shaped appropriately to replace the bone flap. Compared with traditional DC, it can ensure the integrity of the skull without affecting the effect of decompression. This paper presents 2 cases of DC and reviews the literature sustaining our hypothesis.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Medical hypotheses,10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109257,,Cranioplasty; Decompressive bone flap replacement; Decompressive craniectomy; Intracranial hemorrhage; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

But these tumors are rarely associated with cerebral infarction and never so deadly. A 40-year-old man presented with sudden morning isolated aphasia. One hour later, he developed a motor deficit at right upper member, quickly completed with a total right hemiplegia. Imaging studies revealed a left frontotemporal enhancing glioblastoma with a perilesional edema which produced an important mass effect on the posterior arm of the external capsule, on the primary motor cortex posteriorly and the entire sylvian valley anteriorly. Due to major surgical risks associated with left middle cerebral artery (MCA) inclusion and large edema, we decided to postpone the tumor removal and introduce quickly high concentrations of steroids. Twenty-four hours after his admittance, the patient presented a sudden impaired consciousness, coma, and a left mydriasis. A brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed a left malignant MCA infarction, deadly for the patient. To our knowledge, glioblastomas complicated by fatal ischemic stroke have not been reported.

While there are a number of treatment approaches that have demonstrable effects in well controlled clinical settings, it is very difficult to implement these approaches in natural settings. The goal of this study was to report the results of an investigation of the effects of a multicomponent behavioral intervention on the challenging behavior of an adolescent and young adult with growing behavioral concerns after acquired brain injury (TBI). The participants were an 16 year old adolescent male and a 24 year old female, with escalating behavior problems after severe TBI. Multiple baseline designs were used to document the effects of an intervention package that integrated cognitive and executive function intervention to address severe challenging behaviors in natural settings. The following dependent variables were used to establish the effectiveness of the interventions: frequency and intensity of aggressive behaviors and participation in scheduled activities. The intervention included integrated components of positive behavior supports, cognitive supports and specific executive function scripts. These single subject experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention on the reduction of the frequency of problem behaviors and the increase of pro-social behaviors. These two successful interventions extended the findings of previously published data for the successful treatment of behavioral challenges using a flexible support-oriented intervention that combines behavioral, cognitive, and executive function components.",{},,NeuroRehabilitation,10.3233/NRE-141088,,Behavior disorders; cognitive-behavioral intervention; context sensitive treatment; functional assessment; multi-component intervention; neurorehabilitation; positive behavior support; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

We explored this process to improve care and quality of life for brain cancer patients in an academic neuro-oncology program. Brain cancer and its treatments may threaten a patient's quality of life and sense of self in many ways, including impaired cognitive skills, loss of memory, reduced coordination, and limited capacity for self-expression. The impact of symptoms and side effects on quality of life must be evaluated in terms of each patient's identity and may be understood in terms of each patient's story. Insights from Narrative Medicine visits may also be helpful for the treatment team as they seek to assess patient needs, attitudes, and abilities. We provide case-based histories demonstrating applications of Narrative Medicine in the care of patients with brain tumors whose sense of self and quality of life are challenged. The cases include managing frontal lobe syndrome of loss of initiative and pervasive emotional apathy with his wife and young children, regaining a meaningful activity in a patient, re-establishing self-identity in a young woman with ependymoma, and improving spells with coexistent epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of neuro-oncology,10.1007/s11060-017-2542-5,,Brain tumor; Glioblastoma; Narrative medicine; Quality of life; Self-identity,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We report the performance of two pairs of brain-damaged patients who had sustained lesions in different areas of the prefrontal cortex and who showed deficits in classic executive function tasks. The patients were presented with desire reasoning tasks in which two sources of executive control were manipulated: the need to resist interference from one's own desire when inferring someone else's conflicting desire and the need to resist interference from the ascription of an approach motivation when inferring an avoidance-desire. The pattern of performance of the two pairs of patients conformed to a classic double dissociation with one pair of patients showing a deficit in resisting interference from their own perspective but not from the ascription of an approach motivation while the other pair of patients showed the opposite profile.

Their performance on these tasks was compared with age and education matched healthy controls. Patient performance on the motivational decision making and social situations tasks did not differ from controls. Selective emotional facial expression recognition impairment for fear was evident in one patient with a unilateral right ACC lesion (patient 3). ToM impairment was present in only one patient with a bilateral ACC lesion (patient 2). In contrast, the two patients with unilateral right ACC lesions had intact ToM (patients 1 and 3). These findings suggest that medial frontal lobe lesions primarily involving the ACC do not appear to critically disrupt motivational decision making or social situation processing. The ACC plays a role in processing particular types of emotion (fear). Bilateral ACC damage impairs ToM processing, but unilateral damage to the right ACC is not sufficient to disrupt ToM.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,10.1080/13546800444000245,PMC2632760,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

In several of these agraphic disorders, patients can make perseverative errors, and perseverative errors can even be seen in patients who do not have aphasia or apraxic agraphia. Patients who make continuous perseverative errors repeatedly writes the same letter (fruuuit) or word, and patients with recurrent perseverations change their letters, but then incorrectly use letter or word that was previously used (fruiut). We report a patient who demonstrated a different form of graphic perseveration. A 61-year-old man with a right parietal lobe lesion and left-sided neglect developed an inability to write. When attempting to write, he repeatedly wrote the same letter that he first wrote, and wrote these in the same spatial position as the first letter. When spelling, reading aloud, and using a keyboard to write he did not perseverate letters or words. When performing the cancellation test and drawings, he also perseverated.

26399676,The Least Bad Option: Unilateral Extubation after Declaration of Death by Neurological Criteria.,"Bliss, Sally E; Macauley, Robert C",Bliss,"Typically, the determination of death by neurological criteria follows a very specific protocol. An apnea test is performed with further confirmation as necessary, and then mechanical ventilation is withdrawn with the consent of the family after they have had an opportunity to ""say goodbye,"" and at such a time to permit organ retrieval (with authorization of the patient or consent of the next of kin). Such a process maximizes transparency and ensures generalizability. In exceptional circumstances, however, it may be necessary to deviate from this protocol in order to spare family members unnecessary suffering and to reduce moral distress felt by clinical staff. It may also be appropriate, we argue, to refrain from even inquiring about organ donation when the next-of-kin is not only certain to refuse, but lacks the decision-making capacity to potentially consent.

Only slight progress was made after traditional rehabilitation. The patient took part in 20 sessions of relative beta training (program A) and later in 20 sessions of rTMS (program B); both programs were combined with behavioral training. We used standardized neuropsychological testing, as well as ERPs before the experiment, after the completion of program A, and again after the completion of program B. As hypothesized, patient M.L-S showed small improvements in executive dysfunction and behavioral disorders after the conclusion of program A, and major improvement after program B. Similarly, in physiological changes the patient showed small improvement after relative beta training and a significant improvement of the P300 NOGO component after the rTMS program. The rTMS program produced larger physiological and behavioral changes than did relative beta training. A combination of different neurotherapeutical approaches (such as neurofeedback, rTMS, tDCS) can be suggested for similar severe cases of TBI.

Both patients produce similar numbers of semantic paraphasias in naming tasks, but presented one crucial difference: grapheme-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-grapheme conversion procedures were available only to one of them. We investigated the impact of this availability on the process of lexical selection during word production. The patient for whom conversion procedures were not operational produced semantic errors in transcoding tasks such as reading and writing to dictation; furthermore, when asked to name a given picture in multiple output modalities--e.g., to say the name of a picture and immediately after to write it down--he produced lexically inconsistent responses. By contrast, the patient for whom conversion procedures were available did not produce semantic errors in transcoding tasks and did not produce lexically inconsistent responses in multiple picture-naming tasks. These observations are interpreted in the context of the summation hypothesis (Hillis & Caramazza, 1991), according to which the activation of lexical entries for production would be made on the basis of semantic information and, when available, on the basis of form-specific information.

This hypothesis was rejected on the basis of an interactive activation model of word recognition which revealed that modifications at the lexical level did not mimic the patient's pattern of results. Instead, it was found that increasing the rate of decay of activation at the phoneme level produced output that was consistent with the phoneme discrimination, lexical decision, and repetition results. This hypothesis of increased phoneme level decay led to the prediction that speech discrimination would decline with increased interstimulus interval and that short-term memory performance would be impaired.

From these probability estimates and from estimates of attractiveness of various outcomes (made in this study by a clinician) a quantitative assessment of the risks and benefits of surgical versus medical management can be calculated.

We asked whether there is a common neural code that underpins similar conscious experiences, which could be used to decode these experiences in the absence of behavior. To this end, we used richly evocative stimulation (an engaging movie) portraying real-world events to elicit a similar conscious experience in different people. Common neural correlates of conscious experience were quantified and related to measurable, quantitative and qualitative, executive components of the movie through two additional behavioral investigations. The movie's executive demands drove synchronized brain activity across healthy participants' frontal and parietal cortices in regions known to support executive function. Moreover, the timing of activity in these regions was predicted by participants' highly similar qualitative experience of the movie's moment-to-moment executive demands, suggesting that synchronization of activity across participants underpinned their similar experience. Thus we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that a neural index based on executive function reliably predicted every healthy individual's similar conscious experience in response to real-world events unfolding over time. This approach provided strong evidence for the conscious experience of a brain-injured patient, who had remained entirely behaviorally nonresponsive for 16 y.

25306076,Clinical characteristics and brain PET findings in 3 cases of dissociative amnesia: disproportionate retrograde deficit and posterior middle temporal gyrus hypometabolism.,"Thomas-Antérion, C; Dubas, F; Decousus, M; Jeanguillaume, C; Guedj, E",Thomas-Antérion,"Precipitated by psychological stress, dissociative amnesia occurs in the absence of identifiable brain damage. Its clinical characteristics and functional neural basis are still a matter of controversy. In the present paper, we report 3 cases of retrograde autobiographical amnesia, characterized by an acute onset concomitant with emotional/neurological precipitants. We present 2 cases of dissociative amnesia with fugue (cases 1 and 2), and one case of focal dissociative amnesia after a minor head trauma (case 3). The individual case histories and neuropsychological characteristics are reported, as well as the whole-brain voxel-based 18FDG-PET metabolic findings obtained at group-level in comparison to 15 healthy subjects. All patients suffered from autobiographical memory loss, in the absence of structural lesion. They had no significant impairment of anterograde memory or of executive function. Impairment of autobiographical memory was complete for two of the three patients, with loss of personal identity (cases 1 and 2). A clinical recovery was found for the two patients in whom follow-up was available (cases 2 and 3). Voxel-based group analysis highlighted a metabolic impairment of the right posterior middle temporal gyrus. 18FDG-PET was repeated in case 3, and showed a complete functional brain recovery. The situation of dissociative amnesia with disproportionate retrograde amnesia is clinically heterogeneous between individuals. Our findings may suggest that impairment of high-level integration of visual and/or emotional information processing involving dysfunction of the right posterior middle temporal gyrus could reduce triggering of multi-modal visual memory traces, thus impeding reactivation of aversive memories.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology,10.1016/j.neucli.2014.08.003,,Amnésie dissociative; Amnésie rétrograde; Behavioral neurology; Brain PET metabolism; Conversion; Disproportionate retrograde amnesia; Dissociative amnesia; Métabolisme cérébral; Neurologie comportementale; Neuropsychiatrie; Neuropsychiatry; PET-scan,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",France,eng

Bilateral frontal lobe ischemia is associated with cognitive impairment, especially in the context of dysexecutive syndrome. This report describes two patients who underwent bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) reconstruction by A3-A3 anastomosis in conjunction with superficial temporal artery (STA)-radial artery (RA) graft-A3 bypass to treat bilateral ACA steno-occlusive hemodynamic ischemia accompanying cognitive and executive dysfunction. A 74-year-old woman and a 73-year-old woman were admitted to our hospital for unilateral cerebral infarction in the frontal lobe. Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) demonstrated severe bilateral ACA steno-occlusive pathology in both patients. Considering the presence of impaired cognitive function with dysexecutive syndrome as well as hemodynamic compromise shown by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), we proceeded with A3-A3 anastomosis in conjunction with STA-RA-A3 bypass. Various neuropsychiatric tests were performed before and after the surgery. We confirmed good bypass patency without periprocedural complications. One patient recovered from apallic and bedridden status and regained ambulatory condition and ability to take in an oral diet. Another patient demonstrated improved scores in several cognitive tests with some persistent executive dysfunction. Bilateral ACA revascularization was technically feasible in two patients. This bypass surgery could have some positive effects in some basic cognitive function, such as memory, attention, and concentration by bilateral ACA hemodynamic improvement, although executive function, which is specific to prefrontal function, might not be reversible.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Acta neurochirurgica,10.1007/s00701-014-2228-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Austria,eng

The patient, an independent 73-year-old man, became dependent due to dementia. Cognitive dysfunction was characterized by moderately decreased IQ, severe memory disturbances, topographical disorientation, executive dysfunction and loss of self-awareness. Cognitive dysfunction has not advanced for 3 years. Hypo-perfusion in the whole brain, particularly in the left temporal and parietal regions, was visible on 123I-IMP SPECT images. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated damage to the left posterior cingulate cortex, cingulate bundle, superior parietal lobule and subcortical region of the occipital lobe. The fornix was spared. Some subcortical small spotted lesions were detected, but periventricular lucency was not prominent. Structures known to be important in memory but spared by the lesion included the thalamus and basal forebrain. Small spotted subcortical lesions were detected in bilateral hippocampi, which are also known to be important in memory, but these were probably silent lesions. This case suggested that dementia is brought on by the lesion of the left posterior cingulate bundle and retrosplenial cortex causing amnesia by disrupting the cingulate-hippocampal connection or the retrosplenial cortex itself, with the lesion of the left occipitoparietal subcortex causing frontal dysfunction by disrupting the dorsal limbic pathway and occipitofrontal fasciculus of the prefrontal circuits.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,10.5692/clinicalneurol.48.43,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

Subsequently, to validate the findings of this case, processed EEG was recorded during 2 other cases in which care was withdrawn without the use of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs. We found that changes in processed EEG immediately after withdrawal of care were not only reproducible, but can happen in the absence of changes in major electromyographic or electrocardiographic artifact. It is well documented that processed EEG is prone to artifacts. However, in the setting of DCD, these changes in processed EEG deserve some consideration. If these changes are not due to artifact, dosing of hypnotic or anesthetic drugs might be warranted.

A single-case study design was used and three participants (two males, one female) aged 26-43 years with severe TBI were included in the study. In the first study, after a four-session baseline of behavioural practice, two participants received eight MST sessions followed by four maintenance sessions. In the second study, a third participant received 16 sessions of behavioural practice to assess the extent to which error self-regulation improves through long-term task practice and therapist corrections. Participants prepared two different meals with a novel meal introduced later to examine skills generalisation. Behavioural outcomes included error frequency, checking and self-corrections. Data analysis involved a combination of visual analysis and two standard deviation (2-SD) band analysis. In the MST study, the two participants demonstrated a 38% and 76% reduction in error frequency (p < .05), a significant decrease in checks (p < .05), and a significant increase in self-corrections (p < .05) relative to baseline. In the behavioural practice study, the participant demonstrated reduced errors (25%), although this was not statistically significant, and a significant increase in checks (p < .05), but self-corrections did not significantly change (p > .05). This exploratory research suggests that, firstly, by targeting error self-regulation MST can potentially promote independence on complex everyday tasks; and secondly, although behavioural practice alone may facilitate some functional gains, it fails to promote more independent self-regulatory behaviours.",{},,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602010902949223,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Serological examinations revealed high titers of antibodies against thyroglobulin and TPO, and antibody against alpha-enolase was positive. Total protein level in CSF was 40 mg/dl and cell counts were normal. On MRI, localized symmetrical lesions were observed in bilateral pallidum to genu of internal capsule.

17320997,[Non-verbal communication and executive function impairment after traumatic brain injury: a case report].,"Sainson, C",Sainson,"Following post-traumatic impairment in executive function, failure to adjust to communication situations often creates major obstacles to social and professional reintegration. The analysis of pathological verbal communication has been based on clinical scales since the 1980s, but that of nonverbal elements has been neglected, although their importance should be acknowledged. The aim of this research was to study non-verbal aspects of communication in a case of executive-function impairment after traumatic brain injury. During the patient's conversation with an interlocutor, all nonverbal parameters - coverbal gestures, gaze, posture, proxemics and facial expressions - were studied in as much an ecological way as possible, to closely approximate natural conversation conditions. Such an approach highlights the difficulties such patients experience in communicating, difficulties of a pragmatic kind, that have so far been overlooked by traditional investigations, which mainly take into account the formal linguistic aspects of language. The analysis of the patient's conversation revealed non-verbal dysfunctions, not only on a pragmatic and interactional level but also in terms of enunciation. Moreover, interactional adjustment phenomena were noted in the interlocutor's behaviour. The two inseparable aspects of communication - verbal and nonverbal - should be equally assessed in patients with communication difficulties; highlighting distortions in each area might bring about an improvement in the rehabilitation of such people.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,Annales de readaptation et de medecine physique : revue scientifique de la Societe francaise de reeducation fonctionnelle de readaptation et de medecine physique,10.1016/j.annrmp.2007.01.010,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,fre

23851292,Semantic control and modality: an input processing deficit in aphasia leading to deregulated semantic cognition in a single modality.,"Thompson, Hannah E; Jefferies, Elizabeth",Thompson,"Research suggests that semantic memory deficits can occur in at least three ways. Patients can (1) show amodal degradation of concepts within the semantic store itself, such as in semantic dementia (SD), (2) have difficulty in controlling activation within the semantic system and accessing appropriate knowledge in line with current goals or context, as in semantic aphasia (SA) and (3) experience a semantic deficit in only one modality following degraded input from sensory cortex. Patients with SA show deficits of semantic control and access across word and picture tasks, consistent with the view that their problems arise from impaired modality-general control processes. However, there are a few reports in the literature of patients with semantic access problems restricted to auditory-verbal materials, who show decreasing ability to retrieve concepts from words when they are presented repeatedly with closely related distractors. These patients challenge the notion that semantic control processes are modality-general and suggest instead a separation of 'access' to auditory-verbal and non-verbal semantic systems. We had the rare opportunity to study such a case in detail. Our aims were to examine the effect of manipulations of control demands in auditory-verbal semantic, non-verbal semantic and non-semantic tasks, allowing us to assess whether such cases always show semantic control/access impairments that follow a modality-specific pattern, or whether there are alternative explanations. Our findings revealed: (1) deficits on executive tasks, unrelated to semantic demands, which were more evident in the auditory modality than the visual modality; (2) deficits in executively-demanding semantic tasks which were accentuated in the auditory-verbal domain compared with the visual modality, but still present on non-verbal tasks, and (3) a coupling between comprehension and executive control requirements, in that mild impairment on single word comprehension was greatly increased on more demanding, associative judgements across modalities. This pattern of results suggests that mild executive-semantic impairment, paired with disrupted connectivity from auditory input, may give rise to semantic 'access' deficits affecting only the auditory modality.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.06.030,,Aphasia; Modality; Refractory; Semantic; Semantic access; Semantic control,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
19589510,Impaired processing of relative distances between features and of the eye region in acquired prosopagnosia--two sides of the same holistic coin?,"Ramon, Meike; Rossion, Bruno",Ramon,"Acquired prosopagnosia (AP) is characterized by impaired recognition of individual faces following brain damage. The nature of the functional impairment(s) underlying AP remains debated. Recent studies have demonstrated deficient processing of diagnostic information in the region of the eyes (Caldara et al., 2005); other studies suggest that patients fail to judge relative distances between facial features (Barton et al., 2002). We hypothesized that these apparently different observations are related to a common cause. More precisely, we suggest that AP arises due to an impairment of a process that reduces uncertainty about the nature/location of the diagnostic cues for face individualization: the ability to perceive multiple elements of a face as a single global representation (holistic processing). Being impaired at processing individual faces holistically, prosopagnosic patients would tend to perform relatively worse for processing facial areas containing multiple elements (i.e., the eyes), and for elements that are widely spaced apart. Here we tested PS, a single case of AP, at matching unfamiliar faces differing either with respect to local features or inter-feature distances, over the upper and lower areas of the face. A pilot study and Experiment 1 confirmed that PS was extremely poor at using information encompassing the eyes, but was also deficient at perceiving relative distances between features. When uncertainty about the location and nature of the diagnostic cue was removed in Experiment 2, PS' performance remained below normal range, but she improved substantially. Most interestingly, her pattern of performance across the different conditions appeared qualitatively identical to that of normal controls. In line with previous observations of PS and other cases of prosopagnosia, our findings indicate that the reduced reliance on the area of the eyes and on relative distances between features in AP may have a common underlying cause-the disruption of holistic processing of the individual face.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2009.06.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

In the case described, the weight of expert opinion had been that involuntary feeding by gastrostomy tube should be terminated because the patient was functioning at a level little beyond the vegetative state, her quality of life was poor and she was unable to form a view about her present or future circumstances. An assessment approach is described which uses binomial statistics and allows for some variability in responding. Methods of minimizing sources of extraneous bias are also discussed. By use of this technique it was demonstrated that the patient was sentient though impaired, and that her own wish at the time of the assessment was to continue living. It is recommended that neuropsycholgical assessment of this kind should take place in all cases in which withdrawal of treatment is being considered and cognitive ability is not certain.",{},,Brain injury,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The behavioural alterations resemble those of Denny-Brown and Chambers' monkey with bilateral ablation of the parietal lobe which were characterised by strong withdrawal or refusal to be touched on the limbs and head. In both humans and animals, touch on the limbs or head elicited exaggerated withdrawal movements and refusal to be touched on the lips and tongue resulted in difficulty in feeding. These behavioural alterations can be interpreted as loss of exploratory activities towards extrapersonal space, or more positively, as rejection of contact with the environment. This rejection behaviour in which tactile, visual, and/or gustatory exploration tendencies are altered, is a counterpart of human frontal lobe syndrome and human Klüver-Bucy syndrome.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.52.11.1260,PMC1031634,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Poststroke BD is rare and mainly associated with lesion in the prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuit. A 51-year-old woman came to our attention for a mood disorder of recent onset. At 49, she had suffered acute left-sided limb weakness that improved spontaneously four days later. Arterial hypertension was subsequently diagnosed. After 6 months, she began to suffer from alternating brief periods of expansive and elevated mood with longer periods of depressed mood, with a suicide attempt. We performed extensive laboratory and instrumental investigations, as well as, psychiatric consultation, and a cognitive assessment, which was repeated 9 months later. Brain magnetic resonance disclosed leukoaraiosis and a lacunar state of the basal ganglia. Transcranial Doppler showed a patent foramen ovale. A psychiatric consultation led to the diagnosis of BP type II. Neuropsychological evaluation detected deficits in attention/executive functions, verbal fluency, and memory. Nine months later, after specific psychiatric therapy, the psychiatric symptoms were remarkably improved. Our case sheds light on the role of the basal ganglia in mood disorders and the importance of ruling out brain injury in late onset BP.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Behavioural neurology,10.1155/2014/780742,PMC4006608,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

Uni- or bilateral hypacusis or deafness in patients with normal auditory testing is considered to be a result of lesions in the central auditory pathway. Only rarely described is a central phonophobia whereby acoustic stimuli induce unpleasant and painful perceptions, with consecutive avoidance of these factors. Our first patient described acute shooting pain in the right cheek, triggered only through the ringing of a telephone. The second patient had uncomfortable perception of nonverbal noise. For example the wrinkling of paper bags was unbearable for him. The third patient had difficulties localizing the source of sound and disturbing echos while listening to speech or music. Clinically, in all patients symptoms of a brainstem syndrome were found, whereas auditory testing including inspection, audiometry, and stapedius reflex was normal. We found pathological acoustic evoked potentials (AEP) in all three patients with a prolonged latency III-V and T2 lesions in the ipsilateral pons and central auditory pathway. In case one, we suppose a lateral spread between the lateral lemniscus and the central trigeminal pathway.

Because thrombolysis is associated with a risk of serious intracerebral hemorrhage, it is theoretically possible that this treatment increases the risk of bleeding or rupture of these malformations. However, this risk seems very low in clinical practice. We report two cases, one with a probable brainstem cavernous malformation treated with alteplase for a supratentorial ischemic stroke who developed just after treatment a fatal brainstem hemorrhage, and another one with asymptomatic dural arteriovenous fistula, treated by endovascular thrombectomy solely. This approach was safe and effective, and the patient had an endovascular embolization of the fistula one month later as it became symptomatic. Based on the literature, we discuss the bleeding risk of asymptomatic intracranial vascular malformations in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with alteplase, depending on the type of malformation (intracranial aneurysm, arteriovenous and cavernous malformation or fistula), and the alternative therapeutic options.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Revue neurologique,10.1016/j.neurol.2014.03.003,,Anévrisme intracrânien; Cerebrovascular malformation; Infarctus cérébral; Intracranial aneurysm; Ischemic stroke; Malformation vasculaire cérébrale; Thrombolyse; Thrombolysis,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,fre

Despite this, her performance on tests of recognition memory is comfortably within the normal range. In the present series of experiments, we investigated whether or not ROB's performance on tests of recognition memory might be associated with a disproportionately large number of correct decisions made on the basis of familiarity rather than contextual retrieval [e.g. Mandler G. Psychological Review 1980;87:252-71]. Contrary to this hypothesis, the results showed that ROB made a high proportion of remember decisions relative to know decisions in recognition [cf. Gardiner JM. Memory & Cognition 1988;16:309-13] and produced a high recollection score when conscious recollection and familiarity were placed in opposition to one another [cf. Jacoby LL, Woloshyn V, Kelley C. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General 1989;118:115-25.]. ROB's recognition memory performance therefore appears to be qualitatively as well as quantitatively similar to that found in the normal population. As ROB has suffered damage to both the fornix and the anterior thalamus, the results of the present study are consistent with the claim that damage to the extended hippocampal system has a much more severe effect on recall than on recognition [Aggleton JP, Shaw C. Neuropsychologia 1996;34:51-62; Aggleton JP, Saunders RC. Memory 1997;5:49-71]. The present results provide no support, however, for the additional suggestion [Aggleton JP, Brown MW.

In the Strategic Evaluation of Alternatives (SEA) treatment program, AM was trained to compensate for his impairments by explicitly retrieving positive and negative attributes associated with potential actions prior to performing them. The SEA treatment focused specifically on improving AM's ability to obtain financial compensation for his work-related activities. Results showed improved performance on work-related activities and evidence of generalization. Analyses suggested that the process underlying improved performance was compensatory rather than restorative in nature.

The patient had complained of memory problems and deterioration of her concentration skills for about 2 years. Her endocrinologist thought that she was depressed. The patient's physical examination was normal. She scored a full 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination, but neuropsychological evaluation showed a significant deficit in her verbal memory. Routine blood tests and cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed only antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Electroencephalogram showed scarce intermittent bilateral multifocal theta waves. We increased the patient's daily dose of levothyroxine and started her on dexamethasone therapy. Five months later, we repeated the entire evaluation and found both her cognitive function and her electroencephalogram to be normal. Autoimmune encephalopathy associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis is already known to present with either stroke-like episodes or diffuse progressive deterioration. Our patient shows that the encephalopathy can present as a chronic selective memory deficit that can spare executive functions and short-term memory.

Conceptual preparation mechanisms for speech have not been well studied. Several mechanisms have been proposed for jargon aphasia, a fluent, well-articulated, logorrheic propositional speech that is almost incomprehensible. We studied the vast quantity of jargon speech produced by patient J.A., who had suffered an infarct after the clipping of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm. We gave J.A. baseline cognitive tests and experimental word- and sentence-generation tasks that we had designed for patients with dynamic aphasia, a severely reduced but otherwise fairly normal propositional speech thought to result from deficits in conceptual preparation. J.A. had cognitive dysfunction, including executive difficulties, and a language profile characterized by poor repetition and naming in the context of relatively intact single-word comprehension. J.A.'s spontaneous speech was fluent but jargon. He had no difficulty generating sentences; in contrast to dynamic aphasia, his sentences were largely meaningless and not significantly affected by stimulus constraint level. This patient with jargon aphasia highlights that voluminous speech output can arise from disturbances of both language and executive functions. Our previous studies have identified three conceptual preparation mechanisms for speech: generation of novel thoughts, their sequencing, and selection. This study raises the possibility that a ""brake"" to stop message generation may be a fourth conceptual preparation mechanism behind the pressure of speech characteristic of jargon aphasia.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000080,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Performance on the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) at 1 and 6 months after traumatic brain injury was compared with performance on the WAIS-R at 6 months post-injury. The patient demonstrated significant residualized impairment on selected subtests of the CAS at 6 months post-injury (all ps < 0.05). The patient was also significantly impaired on the Information, Vocabulary, Arithmetic and Comprehension verbal subtests of the WAIS-R. The magnitude of these WAIS-R subtest discrepancies occurred with a low base rate (< 1%) in the WAIS-R standardization sample. In addition there was a significant VIQ versus PIQ discrepancy favouring PIQ of a magnitude occurring in less than 5% of the WAIS-R standardization sample. These findings could not be explained on the basis of any prior learning disability, poor educational opportunities, medication use, response bias, confabulation, or low level of general ability. The low scores on the verbal subtests of the WAIS-R in conjunction with the impairment on the CAS subtests are highly suggestive of lasting frontal-executive dysfunction in this patient. Incidental findings of persisting anomia, impaired processing of proverbs, acalculia, and fluctuating verbal attention, as well as impaired retrieval of verbal information in the context of intact PIQ and superior constructional praxis suggest some degree of bilateral representation of linguistic functions.

Her spontaneous speech was markedly reduced in the absence of any syntactical impairment. Her naming, repetition and reading skills were completely normal. Two experimental investigations were carried out. The first investigation found that A.N.G. had a profound impairment in phrase and sentence generation tasks given a verbal context. However, her verbal generative skills were normal when she was asked to describe pictorial scenes and complex actions. Moreover, it was found that A.N.G. had no difficulty ordering the constituent words of a sentence. Thus, it was concluded that her verbal planning skills were intact. The second investigation tested a hypothesis that dynamic aphasia is due to an inability to select a verbal response option whenever the stimulus activates many competing verbal responses. Predictions based upon this hypothesis were confirmed on three different verbal generation tasks. It was found that our patient's grave verbal generative impairment was present for tasks involving stimuli which activate many potential responses. However, it was absent for tasks involving stimuli which activate few or only a single 'prepotent' response. The findings are discussed with reference to traditional interpretations of dynamic aphasia and more general interpretations of prefrontal cortex functioning. On the basis of a computational model of prefrontal cortex functioning, we propose that pure dynamic aphasia may be caused by damage to a 'context' module containing units responsible for selection of verbal response options. Moreover, it is suggested that our findings support the view that Brodmann area 45 is involved in verbal response generation to stimuli which activate many potential response options.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/121.1.77,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

After the worldwide spread of COVID-19, common symptoms are already well known as fever, coughing, shortness of breath, pneumonia, abdominal pain and diarrhea, either loss of olfaction or sense of taste. Neurological complications are perhaps less known as headache, dizziness, agitation, executive dysfunction or, in particular cases, viral encephalitis and acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis may also occur. In COVID-19 patients, ischemic stroke or cerebral vein thrombosis are also more commonly related to the increased risk of thrombosis. In the long term, so called post-COVID syndrome can emerge in the form of fatigue, depression or many other mental disorders. The most common disease of the peripheral nervous system is Guillain-Barré syndrome. This chapter reviews a case of a 41-year-old man presented to the Department of Neurology with facial diplegia, dysarthria and intermittent paresthesia of the upper and lower extremities. 10-14 days before the onset of neurological symptoms, he has gone through COVID-19 infection that involved fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Electrophysiology and liquor samples showed typical signs of a rare Guillain-Barré syndrome subtype - bifacial weakness with paresthesias. We are reviewing the neurological complications of the virus due to the expected increase of case numbers.

16253293,Bilateral dorsolateral thalamic lesions disrupts conscious recollection.,"Edelstyn, Nicola M J; Hunter, Ben; Ellis, Simon J",Edelstyn,"In an earlier study we disputed the claim that the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus is critical for familiarity. We reported patient (QX) who showed a severe deficit in conscious recollection, and behavioural problems (disinhibition, emotional lability) with relative sparing of familiarity-aware memory following a left mediodorsal thalamic lesion. More recent MR imaging has revealed that QX's lesions are more extensive than previously reported and involve both dorsolateral thalamic nuclei, and whilst there is evidence of left mediodorsal thalamic damage, it is not the main focus of damage. This paper reports a full analysis of QX's thalamic pathology alongside a more detailed investigation of his recognition memory, using yes/no and forced-choice procedures, and executive function. The results revealed impairments in yes/no recognition and conscious recollection rates of famous, artist and unknown names. In addition to the previously noted behavioural disinhibition and emotional lability, a deficit in spontaneous planning ability was evident on the Zoo Map Test (subtest of the Bahavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome). Forced-choice recognition, familiarity estimates and remote memory showed higher levels of preservation. The findings indicate that the dorsolateral thalamus is part of the extended hippocampal circuit which is causally critical only for recall and conscious recollection of complex associations rather than for the more automatic processes linked with novelty detection.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.08.012,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,England,eng

23250678,[Neurological manifestations and their functional impact in subjects who have suffered heatstroke].,"Laxe, Sara; Zúniga-Inestroza, Lucía; Bernabeu-Guitart, Montserrat",Laxe,"Heatstroke is a potentially fatal medical emergency characterised by an increase in body temperature above 40 °C and which is accompanied by negative effects on the central nervous system secondary to failure of the thermo-regulatory system. If timely care is not provided, the consequences can be fatal and the patient dies, but they can also result in permanent disabling neurological sequelae that compromise the individual's quality of life. Following a retrospective search on patients diagnosed with heatstroke who were admitted to a brain damage rehabilitation unit, we report the cases of five subjects. The clinical spectrum ranged from motor weakness with severely compromised coordination and balance with ataxia and dysarthria, which were accompanied by cognitive impairment of varying degrees of severity. All the patients required help in performing their basic activities of daily living both before and after treatment with rehabilitation. No functional improvement was observed in the five subjects after completing rehabilitation, which left them wholly dependent on some caregiver. It is therefore essential to prevent heatstroke, provide immediate medical care and, finally, once the clinical signs and symptoms have set in, rehabilitation treatment must be focused on preventing the appearance of complications. In such a situation the existence of social support for relatives and for patients plays a crucial role.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Spain,spa

20183549,To lose the frame of action: a selective deficit in avoiding unpleasant objects following a unilateral temporal lobe lesion.,"Bamford, Susan; Turnbull, Oliver H; Coetzer, Rudi; Ward, Robert",Bamford,"Studies on emotion and its neurobiology have been far more focused on the recognition of emotion than on actions that are caused by emotional states. We investigate the performance of a patient, HS, with a unilateral lesion to the left temporal pole and orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) (including left amygdala), on a well-established approach/avoid task that taps into emotion-driven action. The striking finding of the present study is a remarkable, and selective, slowing of HS's avoidance of unpleasant items in her (impaired) contralesional field. This finding suggests that the left temporal lobe and OFC structures, including the amygdala, appear to be involved in the action component of emotion, specifically in avoiding negative items.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790802680313,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Case H. Y. A 60-year-old right-handed man. On Nov. 14, 1978, the patient had surgery to remove cerebral hematoma in the left frontal lobe. In the neuropsychological examination before the operation, he had shown the clinical features of transcortical motor aphasia characterized by good comprehension of language, preserved repetition, and spontaneous speech disorder. In this stage, it was supposed that the underlying disturbance of spontaneous speech was due to the disabilities of contextual constructions of sentences rather than the lack of speech initiation. Following the operation, however, spontaneous speech disappeared completely for several days. At the same time, the patient showed problems in comprehension, reading, writing and confrontation naming as well as symptoms of disorientation, pathological inertia and 'loss of initiation' in the psychomotor domain. During the following three months, however, the patient did show slight improvement, except for contextual sentence constructions and pathological inertia when taking the complex animal drawing test. In his terminal stages, the clinical symptoms could be summarized as transcortical motor aphasia and mild frontal lobe syndrome. On March 1, 1979, the patient died of Hamman-Rich syndrome. Postmortem examination: The brain weighed 1294 gm.

16029879,Preserved complex emotion-based learning in amnesia.,"Turnbull, Oliver H; Evans, Cathryn E Y",Turnbull,"An important role for emotion in decision-making has recently been highlighted by disruptions in problem solving abilities after lesion to the frontal lobes. Such complex decision-making skills appear to be based on a class of memory ability (emotion-based learning) that may be anatomically independent of hippocampally mediated episodic memory systems. There have long been reports of intact emotion-based learning in amnesia, arguably dating back to the classic report of Claparede. However, all such accounts relate to relatively simple patterns of emotional valence learning, rather than the more complex contingency patterns of emotional experience, which characterise everyday life. A patient, SL, who had a profound anterograde amnesia following posterior cerebral artery infarction, performed a measure of complex emotion-based learning (the Iowa Gambling Task) on three separate occasions. Despite his severe episodic memory impairment, he showed normal levels of performance on the Gambling Task, at levels comparable or better than controls-including learning that persisted across substantial periods of time (weeks). Thus, emotion-based learning systems appear able to encode, and sustain, more sophisticated patterns of valence learning than have previously been reported.","DictElement({'Year': '2005', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2005,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.04.019,,,"Case Reports; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

History data indicate that she was employed in the said company over the period of 20 years as an accountant and until the disclosure of the crime she had had the company's full confidence. She enjoyed a fine reputation at the place of her residence as well. Several months before undertaking criminal actions she had sustained a head and chest injure as a result of a car accident. She was not subjected to hospitalisation then. Before she had not been penalized administratively or legally. She had not suffered from head injuries with a loss of consciousness. During forensic and psychiatric observation, psychiatric, psychological, neurological and electroencephalographic examinations were carried out, skull and chest plain films were taken and computerised tomography of head was conducted. Clinically it was diagnosed as a frontal organic brain damage syndrome complicated by depression. Experts' examinations were steered by psychopathological image, especially axial symptoms of defective function of the frontal lobe, i.e. lack of initiative and spontaneity, deficiency of higher emotions, decline of criticism and lowering of psychomotor drive. Although psychological examination showed that intelligence quotient and the results of 'organic tests' were within normal range, qualitative analysis of the structure of mental functions disclosed impairment of abstract thinking, especially using associative processes. Essential data were gathered from computerised tomography of head which demonstrated cortical atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes and pericentral gyri. However, neurological and electroencephalographic examinations and skull plain film did not bring any significant information.",{},,Psychiatria polska,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Poland,pol

A 58 years-old woman with hypertension and dyslipemia, who after a left thalamic hemorrhage with good radiological evolution, presents a severe amnesic syndrome as well as other subtle changes in orientation and in language, difficulties in managing money and depressive symptoms requiring anxiolytic and antidepressive treatment. All this joined to limitations in the normal course of her work. Followed by neurology service, a positron emission tomography with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose integrated with computed tomography was performed, which showed a hypometabolism in left thalamic area and also in ipsilateral inferior frontal region, explained by the diaschisis phenomenon. Diaschisis phenomenon is a neuroimaging and pathophysiological finding whereby thalamic or basal ganglia strokes cause hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in the ipsilateral or contralateral cortex and could explain cortical distal symptoms. This case report demonstrates the presence of thalamocortical connections, which helps to understand the circuitry of memory and help to explain the association of other cortical symptoms as dysphasia or executive dysfunction.",{},,Revista de neurologia,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Spain,spa

Although the true lumen was adequately wide and cerebral malperfusion deemed unlikely, extracorporeal circulation through the femoral artery caused right cerebral malperfusion, and addition of right axillary artery perfusion was ineffective. Several minutes after innominate artery snaring, cerebral blood flow was suddenly restored and the clinical outcome was favorable. Axillary artery perfusion is occasionally unreliable and inevitably demands careful cerebral flow monitoring. A dead-end false lumen in the innominate and carotid arteries requires special caution. A dual-artery perfusion strategy permits innominate artery occlusion as an emergency measure against unexpected malperfusion.",{},,The Annals of thoracic surgery,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.08.046,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

15246284,Right hemisphere reading mechanisms in a global alexic patient.,"Larsen, Jary; Baynes, Kathleen; Swick, Diane",Larsen,"We investigated the implicit, or covert, reading ability of a global alexic patient (EA) to help determine the contribution of the right hemisphere to reading. Previous studies of alexic patients with left hemisphere damage have suggested that the ability to derive meaning from printed words that cannot be read out loud may reflect right hemisphere reading mechanisms. Other investigators have argued that residual left hemisphere abilities are sufficient to account for implicit reading and moreover do not require the postulation of a right hemisphere system that has no role in normal reading processes. However, few studies have assessed covert reading in patients with lesions as extensive as the one in EA, which affected left medial, inferior temporal-occipital cortex, hippocampus, splenium, and dorsal white matter. EA was presented with lexical decision, semantic categorization, phonemic categorization, and letter matching tasks. Although EA was unable to access phonology and could not overtly name words or letters, she was nevertheless capable of making lexical and semantic decisions at above chance levels, with an advantage for concrete versus abstract words. Her oral and written spelling were relatively intact, suggesting that orthographic knowledge is retained, although inaccessible through the visual modality. Based on her ability to access lexical and semantic information without contacting phonological representations, we propose that EA's implicit reading emerges from, and is supported, by the right hemisphere. Finally, we conclude that her spelling and writing abilities are supported by left hemisphere mechanisms.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.04.001,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

It is referred to as a frontal lobe syndrome. Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns. Consequently, carmofur-induced leukoencephalopathy may uncommonly result in organic personality syndrome in the residual state.
