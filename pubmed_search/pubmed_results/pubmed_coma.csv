30516602,Coma and Brain Death.,"Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Rabinstein,"This article discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients who are comatose and reviews the current knowledge on prognosis from various causes of coma. This article also provides an overview of the principles for determination of brain death as well as advice on how to avoid common pitfalls. Technologic advances have refined our understanding of the physiology of consciousness and the spectrum of disorders of consciousness; they also promise to improve our prognostic accuracy. Yet the clinical principles for the evaluation and treatment of coma remain unaltered. The clinical standards for determination of death by neurologic criteria (ie, brain death) are also well established, although variabilities in local protocols and legal requirements remain a problem to be resolved. Effective evaluation of coma demands a systematic approach relying on clinical information to ensure rational use of laboratory and imaging tests. When the cause of coma is deemed irreversible in the setting of a catastrophic brain injury and no clinical evidence exists for brain and brainstem function, patients should be evaluated for the possibility of brain death by following the clinical criteria specified in the American Academy of Neurology guidelines.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000666,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",United States,eng

Although it can be accompanied by optic neuritis (ON), but long interval between ON and the grave onset has not been reported. Fulminant MS usually occurs as the first onset and previous ON is not common. We report a rare case of 30-year-old woman with a history of ON 1 year ago. The rapid deterioration to vegetative state followed by a seizure and previous ON differentiated this case from previous reported cases. The differential diagnosis of a rapidly progressive leucoencephalopathy in this patient includes inflammatory, vascular, infectious and toxic disorders. Regarding the previous history of optic neuritis with positive brain MRI (multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in white matter) in our patient, multiple sclerosis is the most probable diagnosis. More effective treatments, such as plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide, that influenced on the prognosis of some previous patients could be useful, but should be performed before progressive brain atrophy emerges.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-011-0723-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

30516603,Management of Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest.,"Seder, David B",Seder,"Because the whole-body ischemia-reperfusion insult associated with cardiac arrest often results in brain injury, neurologists perform an important role in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care. This article provides guidance for the assessment and management of brain injury following cardiac arrest. Neurologists have many roles in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care: (1) early assessment of brain injury severity to help inform triage for invasive circulatory support or revascularization; (2) advocacy for the maintenance of a neuroprotective thermal, hemodynamic, biochemical, and metabolic milieu; (3) detection and management of seizures; (4) development of an accurate, multimodal, and conservative approach to prognostication; (5) application of shared decision-making paradigms around the likely outcomes of therapy and the goals of care; and (6) facilitation of the neurocognitive assessment of survivors. Therefore, optimal management requires early neurologist involvement in patient care, a detailed knowledge of postresuscitation syndrome and its complex interactions with prognosis, expertise in bringing difficult cases to their optimal conclusions, and a support system for survivors with cognitive deficits. Neurologists have a critical role in postresuscitation cardiac arrest care and are key participants in the treatment team from the time of first restoration of a perfusing heart rhythm through the establishment of rehabilitation services for survivors.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000669,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

A 16-year-old boy entered to a medical facility in coma (GCS score 6) with the following diagnosis: acute TBI, severe cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, depressed comminuted cranial vault fracture, basilar skull fracture, visceral contusion. CDI was diagnosed in 3 days after injury considering polyuria and hypernatremia (155 mmol/l). Desmopressin therapy was initiated through a feeding tube. Thirst appeared when a patient came out of the coma after 21 days despite ongoing desmopressin therapy. Considering persistent thirst and polyuria, we continued desmopressin therapy in a spray form. Under this therapy, polyuria reduced to 3-3.5 liters per a day. Symptoms of CDI persisted in long-term period (2 years after TBI) while function of adenohypophysis was intact. This case demonstrates a rare development of permanent diabetes insipidus after TBI. CDI manifested only as polyuria and hypernatremia in coma. Thirst joined after recovery of consciousness.

The main clinical manifestation is bleeding, and thrombosis-related complications are rare. This article reports an 87-year-old woman with severe thrombocytopenia for more than 7 years. On day 6 in the hospital, the patient suddenly fell into a coma, and emergency head computed tomography (CT) displayed acute cerebral infarction of the left cerebellar hemisphere, brainstem, and left thalamus. Although thrombocytopenia is often associated with bleeding, there is still a need for vigilance against ischemic diseases. We analyzed the possible causes of acute cerebral infarction with thrombocytopenia and reviewed the literature. Our case is different from the causes of cerebral infarction reported in previous articles, so the relationship between thrombocytopenia and acute cerebral infarction needs further study.

34814769,The MRI of Jahi McMath and Its Implications for the Global Ischemic Penumbra Hypothesis.,"Shewmon, D Alan; Salamon, Noriko",Shewmon,"Jahi McMath was diagnosed brain dead on 12/12/2013 in strict accordance with both the pediatric and adult Guidelines, reinforced by 4 isoelectric electroencephalograms and a radionuclide scan showing intracranial circulatory arrest. Her magnetic resonance imaging scan 9 1/2 months later surprisingly showed gross integrity of cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and upper brainstem. The greatest damage was in the white matter, which was extensively demyelinated and cystic, and in the lower brainstem, most likely from partial herniation that resolved. The apparent integrity of gray matter and the ascending reticular activating system may have provided a potential structural basis for the reemergence of some limited brain functions, while the white matter and lower brainstem lesions would have caused severe motor disability, brainstem areflexia and apnea. The findings indicate that there could never have been a period of sustained intracranial circulatory arrest. Rather, at the time of brain death diagnosis, low blood flow below the detection threshold of the radionuclide scan was sufficient to maintain widespread neuronal viability, though insufficient to support synaptic function. Her case represents the first indirect confirmation of the reality and clinical relevance of global ischemic penumbra, hypothesized in 1999 as a generally unacknowledged and possibly common brain death mimic.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Journal of child neurology,10.1177/08830738211035871,,Jahi McMath; brain death; ischemic penumbra; magnetic resonance imaging,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

35101314,A Severe Baclofen Intoxication Mimicking Post-Hypoxic Encephalopathy: Wait¬†and¬†See!,"Muntinga, Lieke; Klijn, Adine J; Noordergraaf, Gerrit Jan",Muntinga,"A severe baclofen intoxication is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is associated with coma and can cause brainstem reflexes to disappear, simulating a brain death-like condition. When given intensive supportive care and time, patients can recover without residual neurological damage. We present a case of a patient with known spastic cerebral palsy who was found unresponsive with no signs of breathing. He was brought to the Emergency Department, intubated, put on the ventilator, and hemodynamically stabilized. Brainstem reflexes were absent and he appeared brain dead. During the secondary survey, an intrathecal baclofen pump was found at his left lower abdomen, with a swelling next to it. A baclofen intoxication was suspected. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and after 72 h of supportive care complete neurological recovery was achieved. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Systemic baclofen intoxication can simulate a brain death-like condition. There is no reliable correlation between baclofen serum levels and central nervous system depression in case of an intoxication. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize a baclofen intoxication as a possible cause of coma and absent brainstem reflexes. Recuperation is spontaneous and can follow within days without residual damage. Because these patients may be brought in after a period of apnea or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, focus may be on post-hypoxic encephalopathy considerations instead of a possible baclofen intoxication.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2021.11.007,,baclofen; brain death; intoxication; intrathecal; serum level,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

To date, accounts of recovery from BD/DNC in adults have been limited to noncompliance with guidelines. We report the case of a 72-yr-old man with a combined primary infratentorial (hemorrhagic) and secondary global (anoxic) brain lesion in whom decompressive craniectomy of the posterior fossa and six-hour therapeutic hypothermia (33-34¬∞C) followed by 8-hour rewarming to ‚â• 36¬∞C were conducted. Thirteen hours later, clinical findings of brain function loss were documented in addition to guideline-compliant exclusion of reversible causes (arterial hypotension, intoxication, depressant drug effects, relevant metabolic or endocrine disequilibrium, chronic hypercapnia, neuromuscular disorders, and administration of a muscle relaxant). Since a primary infratentorial brain lesion was present, German guidelines required further ancillary testing. Doppler ultrasonography revealed some preserved cerebral circulation, and BD/DNC was not diagnosed. Approximately 24 hr after rewarming to ‚â• 36¬∞C, the patient exhibited respiratory efforts. He continued with assisted respiration until final asystole/apnea, without regaining additional brain function other than mild signs of hemispasticity. Follow-up computed tomography showed partial herniation of the cerebellum through the craniectomy gap of the posterior fossa, alleviating caudal brain stem compression. Therapeutic decompressive craniectomy of the posterior fossa may allow for delayed reversal of apnea. In these patients, proof of cerebral circulatory arrest should be mandatory for diagnosing BD/DNC.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,10.1007/s12630-022-02265-6,PMC9279213,Doppler ultrasonography; brain death; cerebellar hematoma; cessation of brain function; computed tomography angiography; electroencephalography,Case Reports,United States,eng

Bilateral absence of the cortical response (N20 potential) on median somatosensory evoked potentials, on days 1 to 3 after the return of spontaneous circulation, is widely considered as the most reliable predictor of poor outcome with a high specificity and a low false-positive rate. The authors describe the case of a young comatose woman after hypoxic injury because of cardiac arrest whose initial median somatosensory evoked potentials revealed bilateral absence of the N20 response associated with evidence of selective injury to both perirolandic cortices and basal ganglia on brain MRI. This patient made a substantial recovery associated with bilateral reappearance of the N20 potential and resolution of the neuroimaging abnormalities.This case revealed that an acute selective and reversible hypoxic injury to both perirolandic cortices may lead to a temporary loss of the N20 responses and an inaccurate prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest.

Early clinical data, brain computed tomography, and neurophysiological tests (electroencephalogram [EEG] and somatosensory evoked potentials [SEPs]) did not show features with a poor neurological prognostic meaning of an hypoxic encephalopathy. After 4¬†days, the patient showed bilateral loss of the pupillary reflex, and severe and cytotoxic edema was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. SEPs showed a bilateral loss of cortical responses and EEG a suppressed pattern. Nine days after the onset of coma, the patient evolved toward brain death (BD). Because nicotine intoxication might cause respiratory muscle paralysis, without cardiac arrest (CA), it would be important to understand the mechanisms underlying brain damage and to take into account that the current neurological prognostic evidence for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, based on data from patients who all experienced CA may not be reliable.

The aim of this study was to report that late recovery with moderate disability is possible, even after several months in vegetative state. This study describes the case of a 22-year-old male student who recovered consciousness from vegetative state 19 months after a traumatic brain injury which had occurred in December 2000. A further slow recovery of motor and cognitive functions up to a moderate disability was observed over 7 years after the brain injury. The patient now lives in the community, speaks, walks and undertakes daily living as well as outdoor leisure activities independently, has resumed his previous university studies and has a part-time non-competitive job. This case demonstrates that attaining a condition of independent living is possible even after more than 1 year of post-traumatic vegetative state, with an improvement of motor and cognitive functions that can continue for years. Cranioplasty and long-term rehabilitation programmes may be among the variables potentially influencing this unexpected recovery.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050802660446,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Patients diagnosed asymptomatic MMD should have no prior ischemic or hemorrhagic episode and no history of neurologic diseases. The incidence of asymptomatic MMD has turned out to be higher than previously thought due to better diagnosis with the increasing availability of magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance angiography technology. However, the clinical symptoms of asymptomatic MMDs are still obscure. This report presents an asymptomatic MMD patient, who was a previously healthy 42-year-old-woman. The patient suffered from burst coma and started vomiting 3 hours before hospitalization. The patient died of the rupture of hemorrhage located on the right temporal lobe near the cortex. Autopsy revealed that the vascular networks were increased at the right postcentral gyrus and on the surface of the occipital lobe. As a small number of asymptomatic MMD patients have clinical symptoms, we must be aware of the possibility of MMD.

This blinded crossover study explored the effects of familiar auditory sensory training (FAST) compared with a sham stimulation in a patient seven years post severe TBI. Baseline data were collected over 4 weeks to account for variability in status with neurobehavioral measures, including the Disorders of Consciousness scale (DOCS), Coma Near Coma scale (CNC), and Consciousness Screening Algorithm. Pre-stimulation neurophysiological assessments were completed as well, namely Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP) and Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEP). Results revealed that a significant improvement in the DOCS neurobehavioral findings after FAST, which was not maintained during the sham. BAEP findings also improved with maintenance of these improvements following sham stimulation as evidenced by repeat testing. The results emphasize the importance for continued evaluation and treatment of individuals in chronic states of seriously impaired consciousness with a variety of tools. Further study of auditory stimulation as a passive treatment paradigm for this population is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation Clinicians should be equipped with treatment options to enhance neurobehavioral improvements when traditional treatment methods fail to deliver or maintain functional behavioral changes. Routine assessment is crucial to detect subtle changes in neurobehavioral function even in chronic states of disordered consciousness and determine potential preserved cognitive abilities that may not be evident due to unreliable motor responses given motoric impairments.

21222050,Ventilator autocycling and delayed recognition of brain death.,"McGee, William T; Mailloux, Patrick",McGee,"Improvements in technology play an important role in caring for critically ill patients. One example is the advance in ventilator design to facilitate triggering of mechanical breaths. Minimal changes in circuit flow unrelated to respiratory effort can trigger a ventilator breath and may mislead caregivers in recognizing brain death. We observed patients with devastating brain injuries in a mixed medical/surgical intensive care unit (ICU) with a high clinical suspicion for brain death including the absence of cranial nerve function with apparent spontaneous breathing during patient-triggered modes of mechanical ventilation. Further clinical observation for spontaneous respirations was assessed upon removal of ventilatory support. Nine patients with brain injury due to multiple etiologies were identified and demonstrated no spontaneous respirations when formally assessed for apnea. Length of time between brain death and its recognition could not be determined. When brain-dead patients who are suitable organ donors are mistakenly identified as having cerebral activity, the diagnosis of brain death is delayed. This delay impacts resource utilization, impedes recovery and function of organs for donation, and adversely affects donor families, potential recipients of organs, and patient donors who may have testing and treatment that cannot be beneficial. Patients with catastrophic brain injury and absent cranial nerve function should undergo immediate formal apnea testing.",{},,Neurocritical care,10.1007/s12028-010-9491-6,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

16269899,Clinical management of the organ donor.,"Arbour, Richard",Arbour,"There is a critical mismatch between available organs for transplant and acutely or critically ill patients with end-stage organ disease. Patients who may benefit from organ transplantation far outnumber available organs. The causes for this imbalance are multiple. One cause is family refusal to donate. A second cause is nonrecognition or delay in determination of brain death. A third cause is donor loss due to profound cardiopulmonary and metabolic instability consequent to brain-stem herniation and brain death. Family refusal may be addressed by education, public awareness, as well as close attention to social, cultural and ethical issues, and optimal communication with donor families. Brain death may be consequent to traumatic brain injury, ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke, as well as massive cerebral anoxia/ischemic following cardiac arrest. Nonrecognition or delay in brain death determination may be addressed by clinician education and frequent clinical assessment to detect early stages of brain-stem herniation refractory to aggressive measures for control of intracranial pressure. Donor loss due to profound cardiopulmonary and metabolic instability may be addressed by aggressive, mechanism-based treatment for clinical instability based on affected body system, as well as measures to support metabolic activity at the cellular and tissue level in the brain-dead organ donor. This article explores cerebral physiology related to impending brain death and catastrophic intracranial pressure elevations. In addition, physiologic consequences of brain death are correlated with affected body systems and mechanism-based therapies to support organ function pending transplantation.

However, better understanding of how the brain responds to energy depletion could help predict the time available for resuscitation until irreversible damage and advance development of interventions that prolong this span. Experimentally, injury to central neurons begins only with anoxic depolarization. This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2 to 5 minutes after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury. To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate-Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies produced a decline in brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p<sub>ti</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) and circulatory arrest. Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in 8 patients. This silencing, termed ""nonspreading depression,"" developed during the steep falling phase of p<sub>ti</sub> O<sub>2</sub> (intraparenchymal sensor, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ6) at 11 (interquartile range [IQR]‚Äâ=‚Äâ7-14) mmHg.

In 1 patient, terminal spreading depolarization induced the initial electrocerebral silence in a spreading depression pattern; circulatory arrest developed thereafter.

After 26 months of such training, she progressively presented with unexpected signs of awareness. Thus, she was submitted to an intensive cognitive rehabilitation with a significant improvement of her performance (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score, 19). With this report, we want to underline that the early use of paraclinical methods, including neuroimaging and neurophysiological paradigms, is mandatory in DOC to reach a more accurate diagnosis and perform the most appropriate neurorehabilitation.

It develops when a traumatic dural tear occurs allowing cerebrospinal fluid outflow, and it often appears associated with hydrocephalus. We present a case of a 29-year-old female who suffered a motor vehicle accident causing severe brain trauma and spinal cord injury. At hospital arrival the patient scored three points in the Glasgow Coma Scale. Admission computed tomography of the head and neck demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and atlanto-occipital dislocation. Three weeks later, when impossibility to disconnect her from mechanical ventilation was noticed, a magnetic resonance imaging of the neck showed a large retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele. No radiological evidence of hydrocephalus was documented. Given the poor neurological status of the patient, with spastic quadriplegia and disability to breathe spontaneously due to bulbar-medullar injury, no invasive measure was performed to treat the pseudomeningocele. Retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele after atlanto-occipital dislocation should be managed by means of radiological brain study in order to assess for the presence of hydrocephalus, since these two pathologies often appear associated. If allowed by neurological condition of the patient, shunting procedures such as ventriculo-peritoneal or lumbo-peritoneal shunt placement may be helpful for the treatment of the pseudomeningocele, regardless of craniocervical junction management.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",10.1007/s00586-007-0531-7,PMC2525892,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

Brief report of two cases.,"Corsi, Fabio Massimo; Gerace, Carmela; Ricci, Monica",Corsi,"Two patients with post-coma reactivation deficiency who showed a ""dramatic"" response to rotigotine therapy are described. They had suffered from prolonged coma due to lesions in the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area. The authors believe that rotigotine effect in these cases could be due to restoration of dopaminergic transmission in medial frontal areas previously ""de-afferented"" from the lesions. Some comatous patients may experience a prolonged difficulty in recovering a normal state of consciousness. This phenomenon may be due to dysfunction of amynergic activating pathways connecting brainstem to the frontal cerebral cortex. In particular, dysfunction of dopaminergic pathways from the mesencephalon to the frontal cortical areas may be responsible for clinical pictures characterized by preserved alertness and total loss of interactions with the surrounding environment; the so called ""waking coma"" cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v91i1.7659,PMC7569577,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

22516437,Confounding factors in brain death: cardiogenic ventilator autotriggering and implications for organ transplantation.,"Arbour, Richard B",Arbour,"Brain death is characterised by a flaccid, areflexic neurological examination; fixed, dilated and midpoint pupils and total absence of intrinsic respiratory drive. A non-reversible clinical state or brain lesion must also be identified. Integral to brain death diagnosis is loss of respiratory drive. Following terminal brainstem herniation, a cardiovascular hyperdynamic state often occurs. This hyperdynamic state causes cyclical volume displacement within the chest in phase with the cardiac cycle, causing oscillations in gas flow patterns and may be reflected in ventilator airway pressure and flow waveforms. When these flow/pressure waveform oscillations meet or exceed ventilator flow or pressure trigger sensitivity, ventilator breaths may be triggered in the total absence of intrinsic respiratory drive. In a patient with no apparent neurological function who is still triggering ventilator breaths, detailed analysis of ventilator pressure/flow waveforms in context with neurological assessment findings can identify cardiac autotriggering in a brain-dead patient. Undetected, cardiogenic ventilator autotriggering results in prolonged ICU stay and potential loss of transplantable organs. Collaborative practice and aggressive surveillance to determine loss of all neurologic function and evaluate possible autotriggering in this population is paramount and can minimise ICU stay, reduce costs of care, decrease family stress and facilitate recovery of transplantable organs.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Intensive & critical care nursing,10.1016/j.iccn.2012.03.003,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Netherlands,eng

We describe a patient with impaired consciousness following DPHL, concurrent with injury of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) shown using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). A 50-year-old male patient was in a drowsy mental state after exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) for about ten hours. About a day after the CO exposure, his mental state recovered to an alert condition. However, his consciousness deteriorated to drowsy 24¬†days after the exposure and worsened to a semi-coma state at 26¬†days after onset. When he started rehabilitation six weeks after the CO exposure, he had impaired consciousness, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 and a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score of 8. On 6-week DTT, decreased neural connectivity of the upper ARAS between the intralaminar thalamic nucleus and the cerebral cortex was observed in both frontal cortices, basal forebrains, basal ganglia and thalami. The lower dorsal ARAS was not reconstructed on the right side, and was thin on the left side. The lower ventral ARAS was not reconstructed on either side. Using DTT, we demonstrated injury of the ARAS in a patient with impaired consciousness following DPHL.

A recently married, previously healthy, young Arabic female presented to the emergency department three times with a complaint of throbbing frontal headache for the past 2¬†days with no neurological deficit.

33962776,Efficacy and Safety of Machine Perfusion for Brain Death Marginal Donor Kidney Transplantation: A Report of 2 Cases.,"Nakamura, Yuki; Miki, Katsuyuki; Yokoyama, Takayoshi; Tatsuki, Suguru; Tanaka, Koji; Ubara, Yoshifumi; Sawa, Naoki; Ishii, Yasuo",Nakamura,"After the revised organ transplant law came into effect in Japan, donations of organs under brain death have been increasing; however, because of the expansion of donor indications, donations from expanded criteria donors and cardiac arrest donors (donation after cardiac death) have also increased. In kidney transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury results in a high rate of delayed graft function, which adversely affects patients' long-term prognoses. Hypothermic machine perfusion preservation results in superior postoperative function and survival rates compared with cold storage preservation. We used an organ preservation device for kidneys and performed a graft viability evaluation before to kidney transplantation. We used the CMP-X08 perfusion device (Chuo-Seiko Co, Ltd, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan) and Belzer MPS solution to preserve the donated organ. The perfusion pressure and temperature were monitored during cold storage with continuous perfusion. Standard renal transplantation protocols were followed. A renal biopsy was performed 1 hour after transplantation and the renal function was evaluated. This study followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first presented case is of a 63-year-old woman who received a kidney from a middle-aged man with brain death due to hypoxic encephalopathy. The creatinine at the time of admission was 0.9 mg/dL and at the time of excision was 2.86 mg/dL. The total perfusion time was 120 minutes. The total ischemia time was 7 hours and 15 minutes. The recipient urinated 115 minutes postoperatively, and no dialysis was required. The second presented case is of a 47-year-old man with a 15-year history of dialysis who received a kidney from a middle-aged woman with brain death due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. The creatinine at the time of admission was 0.8 mg/dL and at the time of excision was 0.77 mg/dL. The total perfusion time was 240 minutes. The total ischemia time was 13 hours and 14 minutes. The recipient urinated 38 minutes postoperatively, and no dialysis was required. Mechanical perfusion storage performed for 2 to 4 hours resulted in a viable organ that was successfully transplanted in both cases.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Transplantation proceedings,10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.03.045,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The patient received oral amantadine for 3 months. fMRI was repeated after treatment. Activation around the left insular regions occurred during stimulation by a familiar voice, and activity in the left temporal and bi-occipital cortices occurred during stimulation by a familiar/unfamiliar voice. Activity in the bilateral frontal and parietal cortices occurred during the motor-imagination task. Brain cortex activation was reduced in the VS patient compared with the healthy volunteer. However, the patient responded to certain auditory stimuli and motor imagery, suggesting that he retained some intact auditory and motor cortical functions. fMRI scans after 3 months of treatment showed increased activation of brain areas corresponding to task instructions. fMRI could be used to observe the effects of amantadine on brain function, and to aid the diagnosis and prognostic prediction in VS patients in terms of recovery and rehabilitation planning.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,The Journal of international medical research,10.1177/0300060518814127,PMC6381504,Vegetative state; amantadine; brain function; fMRI; rehabilitation; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

However, literature is limited in illustrating the use of an early, aggressive program with an added focus on dynamic and active upright mobilization. The purpose of this case report is to describe a two-week aggressive, upright standing and walking program with an individual with traumatic brain injury in an acute inpatient rehabilitation setting. The case investigates the association between aggressive mobilization with changes in level of consciousness and daily cognitive, motor and communicative behaviours. A 30-year-old male classified in DOC as minimally conscious state (MCS) participated in an early upright mobilization program. The two-week intervention consisted of aggressive static/passive and dynamic/active upright mobilization activities, involving a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team. Expressive communication, motor responses and current level of consciousness were monitored and assessed twice a day. Additionally, the patient's activation and arousal were subjectively monitored during daily therapy sessions. Following the dynamic/active mobilization activities, the patient demonstrated improved expressive communication, motor scores and increased activation and arousal during the mobilizations. After the two-week intervention, he emerged from DOC. This case report illustrates intense, more active/dynamic upright mobilization with the use of assisted technologies provides promise as an effective intervention for improving communication, motor responses, arousal and level of consciousness in a patient in MCS. Initiating upright, active activity sooner in the recovery process, may lead to improved outcomes and quicker emergence.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONAggressive upright mobilization may be delivered safely to patients in DOC early in their rehabilitative care.Aggressive upright mobilization may be beneficial for patients in DOC.Higher intensity, more active/dynamic upright mobilization such as the use of Erigo<sup>¬Æ</sup>Pro‚Äâ+‚Äâstepping and locomotor training on a treadmill with body weight support demonstrated positive outcomes with expressive communication, motor responses and arousal.Earlier initiation of aggressive mobilization may promote recovery.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Disability and rehabilitation.

35354782,Burst Suppression Electroencephalography (EEG) Pattern with Coma and Loss of Brain Stem Reflexes Following a Baclofen Overdose with Subsequent Full Recovery.,"McGowan, Jeffrey D; Betten, David P",McGowan,"BACKGROUND When taken in overdose, baclofen can produce a unique pattern of clinical findings and EEG abnormalities that contrasts to that seen with other sedative hypnotic medications. This includes profound lethargy and coma, loss of basic brainstem reflexes and pupil reactivity, myoclonic jerks and seizures, and a burst suppression pattern on EEG. In the absence of a clear history of ingestion, clinicians may presume the presence of anoxic brain injury and that a progression towards brain death may be imminent. CASE REPORT We report a case of a middle-aged woman found unresponsive who presented with apnea, loss of rudimentary neurologic findings on physical exam, burst suppression EEG findings, and a prolonged comatose state for nearly 48 h, followed by rapid resolution of symptoms secondary to a supratherapeutic baclofen ingestion. CONCLUSIONS Baclofen toxicity can present both clinically and with EEG abnormalities consistent with anoxic brain injury, suggesting an inevitable progression to brain death. When provided with appropriate supportive care and prolonged observation, improvement with full neurologic recovery is often seen despite the initial grim clinical picture.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.936280,PMC8978149,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and performed serial electroencephalography (EEG) in a 60-year-old woman in coma after cardiac arrest. The first EEG was recorded after 48 hours (GCS=5; E1-V1-M3); brain-stem reflexes were preserved. The EEG pattern showed monotonous alpha frequencies (10-11 Hz) with posterior predominance; acoustic and noxious stimuli evoked EEG reactivity. Early cortical SEPs (72 h) were normal. On the fifth day (GCS=8; E4-V1-M3), the EEG alpha pattern was replaced by a diffuse delta activity; rhythmic theta changes appeared spontaneously or in response to stimuli. The patient regained consciousness on the tenth day and EEG showed posterior theta activity (6-7 c/s) partially reactive to stimuli. At the 6-month follow-up, cognitive evaluation showed mild dementia. Recent studies identified two forms of AC. Patients with complete AC have an outcome that is almost invariably poor. Conversely, incomplete AC (posteriorly accentuated alpha frequency, reactive and with SEPs mostly normal) reflects a less severe degree of anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The case we report should be classified, according to the SEPs and EEG features, as incomplete AC. The fact that the patient has regained consciousness, even if with residual cognitive impairment, confirms the need to distinguish this variant from complete AC.",{},,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-003-0195-y,,,Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article,Italy,eng

She showed a sleep-wake cycle, but no evidence of cognitive functioning. Six months after her illness, she began to respond to her environment and eventually returned home to the care of her parents, with regular periods of respite care in a home for people with severe physical disabilities. She remains in a wheelchair with a severe dysarthria and communicates via a letter board. Two years after her illness, staff at the home requested an assessment of her cognitive functioning. On the WAIS-R verbal scale and the Raven's Progressive Matrices, the woman's scores were in the normal range. So too were her recognition of real versus nonsense words and her memory functioning (apart from a visual recognition memory test which was in the impaired range). Although she enjoyed the tests, she became distressed when asked about her illness and previous hospitalization. She was reassessed 1 year later, when there were few significant changes in her test scores but she could talk about her illness and hospitalization without becoming distressed. She was angry, however, about her experiences in the first hospital. Further tests suggested good executive functioning. In short, this woman's cognitive functioning is in the normal range for most tasks assessed, despite a severe physical disability and dysarthria, and despite the fact that she was vegetative for 6 months. Although some recovery following 6 months of being vegetative/minimally conscious is not unknown, it is rare, particularly for those with non-traumatic injuries, and the majority of people similarly affected remain with significant cognitive deficits. This client has, by and large, made an almost complete cognitive recovery. She feels positive about her life now and says the formal assessment showed people she was not stupid and this made her happy.

However, IH can be associated with a large diversity of clinical or radiological signs leading to difficult diagnosis especially in case of coma. The association of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and subdural hemorrhage is rare but should suggest the diagnosis of IH. Case report. We report here a case of comatose patient due to spontaneous IH complicated by CVT and subdural hemorrhage. The correct diagnosis was delayed due to many confounding factors. IH was suspected after subdural hemorrhage recurrence and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After 2 epidural patches with colloid, favorable outcome was observed. The most common presentation of IH is postural orthostatic headaches. In the present case report, the major clinical signs were worsening of consciousness and coma, which are a rare presentation. Diagnosis of IH is based on the association of clinical history, evocative symptomatology, and cerebral imaging. CVT occurs in 1-2% of IH cases and the association between IH, CVT, and subdural hemorrhage is rare. MRI is probably the key imaging examination. In the present case, epidural patch was performed after confounding factors for coma had been treated. Benefit of anticoagulation had to be balanced in this case with potential hemorrhagic complications, especially within the brain. Association of CVT and subdural hemorrhage should lead to suspect IH. Brain imaging can help and find specific signs of IH.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Headache,10.1111/head.13977,,cerebral venous thrombosis; coma; intracranial hypotension; subdural hematoma,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Recently, a paradoxical arousing effect of zolpidem in patients with severe brain damage has been repeatedly reported. A placebo-controlled magnetic resonance study was conducted to evaluate its effect on BOLD and metabolites spectral signals in a patient with severe brain injuries and an age-matched healthy volunteer. A multi-modal analysis was used to assess aspects in the pharmacologically-induced changes in the resting-state brain metabolism. A significantly increased BOLD signal was transiently localized in the left frontal cortices, bilateral anterior cingulated areas, left thalamus and right head of the caudate nucleus. The healthy subject showed a deactivation of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. BOLD signal changes were found to significantly correlate with concentrations of extravascular metabolites in the left frontal cortex. It is discussed that, when zolpidem attaches to modified GABA receptors of neurodormant brain cells, brain activation is induced. This might explain the significant correlations of BOLD signal changes and proton-MRS metabolites in this patient after zolpidem. It was concluded that proton-MRS and BOLD signal assessment could be used to study zolpidem-induced metabolic modulation in a resting state.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2013.794961,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Laboratory data obtained when the patient lapsed into a coma showed that she had a low level of serum glucose (27 mg/dL). Although the level of glucose returned to within the normal range rapidly after glucose infusion, the patient remained in a coma for 22 months. It was presumed that the state of hypoglycemia persisted for about 4 h. There was no evidence of hypotension or hypoxia. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 3 h after glucose administration; diffusion-weighted images revealed hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter and in the boundary zone between the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Post-mortem examination revealed superficial laminar necrosis throughout the cerebral cortex. Neuronal necrosis was also found in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, although the CA3 region appeared normal. In addition to these lesions, which are consistent with hypoglycemia-induced brain damage, the cerebral white matter exhibited severe loss of myelin and axons with reactive astrocytosis and macrophage infiltration. Old infarcts were also present in the bilateral occipital lobes.

Here we presented exploratory data concerning an Italian adaptation of FCM administered to patients with sABI. After the translation into Italian language, the FCM was blindly administered by 2 independent speech therapists to 19 patients (10 males; median age‚Äâ=‚Äâ58; IQR‚Äâ=‚Äâ25) admitted to neurorehabilitation unit after sABI with a level of cognitive functioning between 4 and 8. Two further patients who presented a pDoC after sABI and emerged from the minimally conscious state (a 64-year-old female and a 74-year-old female) were also evaluated by means of the FCM, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, and the Disability Rating Scale. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect for attention, memory, and swallowing items, and substantial for communicative-augmentative communication, motor speech, spoken language expression, and spoken language comprehension. Importantly, in the two pDoC patients, the FCM identified two different functioning profiles in the attention, swallowing, motor speech, and spoken language expression scales, notwithstanding the two patients achieved the same scores on scales for functional disability and consciousness level. The FCM might be a promising and easy-to-administer tool to assess communicative functions in patients with sABI, independently from evaluation of functional disability.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-06173-x,,Acquired brain injury; Diagnosis; Disorders of consciousness; Functional Communication Measures; Language; Rehabilitation,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The difficulties in correctly ascertaining unawareness after brain injury have been emphasized by a number of authors. It is well recognized that toxic-metabolic and drug-induced cerebral depression occurs acutely after brain injury. However, less attention has been drawn to the effects of medication months after brain injury and the way in which medication may confound assessment of awareness and, thus, the reliable assessment of long-term prognosis. This paper describes two patients who sustained a severe and well-documented structural brain injury, one hypoxic and one traumatic. Both were unaware when first seen at 3 months post-injury, but both have made useful functional recovery. The paper discusses their progress and how the early prescription of large doses of anti-epileptic drugs, sedatives and anti-spastic agents in these circumstances may result in an initial misdiagnosis of the vegetative state.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/0269905031000149533,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

TBI may affect emotional, sensory-motor, cognitive, and psychological functions with a consequent worsening of both patient and his/her caregiver's quality of life. In recent years, technological innovations allowed the development of new, advanced sensory stimulation systems, such as Neurowave, to further stimulate residual cognitive abilities and, at the same time, evaluate residual cognition. An 69-year-old Italian man entered our neurorehabilitation unit with a diagnosis of minimally conscious state following severe TBI. He breathed spontaneously via tracheostomy and was fed via percutaneous gastrostomy. At the neurological examination, the patient showed severe tetraparesis as he showed fluctuating alertness and responsiveness to external stimuli and opened the eyes without stimulation. Patient was affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage and frontotemporal bilateral hematoma, which were surgically treated with decompressive craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty about 6 months before. The patient underwent a neuropsychological and clinical evaluation before (T0) and after a conventional rehabilitation cycle (T1), and after a Neurowave emotional stimulation-supported rehabilitative cycle (T2). Following conventional rehabilitation (T1), the patient achieved a partial improvement in behavioral responsiveness; there was also a mild improvement in the caregiver's distress. Conversely, Neurowave emotional stimulation session determined (at T2) a significant improvement of the patient's behavioral responsiveness, cognition, and in the caregiver's distress. The P300 recording in response to the NES showed a significant change of P300 magnitude and latency. Our data suggest that emotional-integrated sensory stimulation using adequate visual stimuli represents a beneficial, complementary rehabilitative treatment for patients in minimally conscious state following a severe TBI. This may occur because stimuli with emotional salience can provide a reliable motivational resource to stimulate motor and cognitive recovery following severe TBI.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000026685,PMC8341226,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Specifically, we were interested in the recovery dynamics of 3-dimensional components of selfhood (a 3-dimensional construct model for the complex experiential selfhood has been recently proposed based on the empirical findings on the functional-topographical specialization of 3 operational modules of brain functional network responsible for the self-consciousness processing) derived from the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. The analysis revealed progressive (though not monotonous) restoration of EEG functional connectivity of 3 modules of brain functional network responsible for the self-consciousness processing, which was also paralleled by the clinically significant functional recovery. We propose that restoration of normal integrity of the operational modules of the self-referential brain network may underlie the positive dynamics of 3 aspects of selfhood and provide a neurobiological mechanism for their recovery. The results are discussed in the context of recent experimental studies that support this inference. Studies of ongoing recovery after severe brain injury utilizing knowledge about each separate aspect of complex selfhood will likely help to develop more efficient and targeted rehabilitation programs for patients with brain trauma.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,10.1177/1550059417696180,,EEG; alpha rhythm; coma; default-mode network (DMN); electroencephalogram; first-person perspective; functional connectivity; minimally conscious state.; operational synchrony; self-referential network; subjective sense of self; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; vegetative state,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Unfortunately, functional neuroimaging in persistent vegetative state is extremely complex and subject to numerous methodological, clinical and theoretical difficulties. Here, we describe the strategy used to study residual auditory and speech processing in a single patient with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Identical positron emission tomography studies, conducted nine months apart, revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of auditory cortex in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging examination at the time of the second session revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension.

Steps taken in the emergency department (ED) can be critical to preserving the option of organ donation in patients whose neurologic insult places them on a potential path to declaration of brain death. Much of the literature on this subject has focused on the utilitarian value of clinical interventions in the potential organ donor to optimize the likelihood of effective organ procurement. In this article, we present an actual case that reveals additional ethical perspectives to consider in how emergency physicians manage patients in the ED who can be confidently predicted to progress to death, as attested by neurologic criteria, and become organ donors. The case involves a patient with a devastating, nonsurvivable intracerebral hemorrhage who rapidly progressed to hemodynamic instability. This case reveals how the current organ donor referral and maintenance system raises ethical tensions for emergency physicians and ED personnel.

In some patients where EEGs showed a significant contamination of muscle and background noise, the SEP studies helped to identify the level of dysfunction. The severity of the clinical condition (GCS score) correlated significantly (p = 0.003) with the prolongation of the CCT. Asymmetries in CCTs were more frequent in the stroke group than in the other groups. The presence of asymmetries in CCT in diffuse encephalopathies indicated a variable degree of dysfunction in the ascending sensory pathways, which clinically were not easily identifiable. This fact raised the possibility of either pre-existing lesion(s) or recent insult(s) such as ischemia. The presence or absence of N20 appeared to influence the duration of survival in subgroups. Some degree of difference in duration of survival was noted among the metabolic group with and without N20 potential. The subset of patients with N20 potential survived relatively longer than the group without it. A suggestion of influence was seen in the stroke group, but caution must be exercised because the absence of N20 was compatible with survival. The hypoxic group did not show any difference. A combination of prolonged interpeak EP-N13 and N13-N20 indicated a poor prognosis. A distinct absence of Wave I in BAER limited its usefulness on some occasions. A combination of abnormal interpeak III-V and abnormal CCT seemed to suggest a poor prognosis. Although death generally occurred earlier in the stroke group, age did not seem to influence the mortality in the first 10 days. Similarly, the cause of death also did not seem to influence the course in those 10 days.

'Emily', a 44-year-old lady was admitted to a rehabilitation unit in Ireland one year post onset of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Standardized assessments diagnosed her as being in a minimally conscious state (MCS). An IDT protocol was devised to stimulate and record responses to sensory and pharmacological stimuli. The protocol was applied pre and post administration of Zolpidem 10¬†mg. Across standardized measures of awareness, improved results post-Zolpidem were recorded. Spontaneous, appropriate verbalization was the most significant change observed 30¬†min after administration of Zolpidem 10¬†mg. This ceased after approximately 2¬†h with Emily reverting to a non-verbal state. The combined effect of Zolpidem and the IDT protocol applied over an eight-week period resulted in durable functional and communicative gains for Emily, inferring neuro-plasticity.

To study five patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with different behavioural features, we employed [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), MRI and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. Each patient's brain expressed a unique metabolic pattern. In three of the five patients, co-registered PET/MRI correlate islands of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behaviour. Two patients had suffered anoxic injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30-40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with relatively higher metabolic rates, that ranged up to 50-80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained <50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the cortical level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioural patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioural fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical- pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients do not appear to represent random survivals of a few neuronal islands; rather they reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awf131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Bi-central PEDs were associated with myoclonus when provoked by strong and protracted stimuli, but remained subclinical when elicited by auditory or mild tactile stimuli. Spontaneous and stimulus-induced bi-central PEDs disappeared after full neurological recovery. These findings link stimulus-induced PEDs to epileptic cortical myoclonus, and further suggest that in certain comatose patients they may represent reflex epileptic activity, even when clinically silent.

Three weeks later, upon inadvertent reinstitution of enalapril and indapamide, severe hyponatremic encephalopathy promptly recurred; recovery was again rapid following fluid restriction and withdrawal of both medications. This temporal relationship establishes the thiazide diuretic or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or both as the cause of the profound symptomatic hyponatremia in this patient. Results of simultaneous serum and urine osmolality assays on several occasions were consistent with a decrease in free water clearance, a result of either increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or potentiation of its peripheral action, and thiazide-induced natriuresis. The use of a thiazide diuretic in the presence of either of these aberrations of ADH homeostasis most likely explains the profound and rapid development of hyponatremia.

A 48-year-old male patient underwent craniectomy and hematoma removal for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia and thalamus. When he started rehabilitation at 5 weeks after onset he was in a vegetative state with a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score of 6. The patient was diagnosed spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the right basal ganglia and thalamus. He underwent comprehensive rehabilitation including neurotropic durgs, transcranial direct current stimulation, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left prefrontal lobe (Brodmann area 10). After 5 weeks of rehabilitation, the patient had recovered to a nearly normal conscious state with a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised score of 22. On 10-week DTT, thickening of the lower dorsal ARAS was observed on both sides compared with 5-week DTT. Decreased neural connectivity to the left PFC was observed on 5-week DTT whereas decreased neural connectivity to the left PFC was increased on 10-week DTT, especially the mPFC. Increased thalamocortical connectivity to the mPFC was demonstrated in a stroke patient who showed concomitant recovery from a vegetative state to a nearly normal conscious state.

There is a growing literature stressing the importance of accurately determining these patients' level of cognitive functioning and its role in appropriate rehabilitation and long term management. The single case design model appears to be the intervention of choice, with its great flexibility and tailored approach to each individual case. The recent literature has focused on the technical aspects of the assessment, offering clear procedural guidelines. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information about clinical factors such as clinical setting and family involvement, which may interfere with or prevent a planned intervention. The case of MT is presented, who was the subject of a single case intervention 9 months following an extremely severe traumatic brain injury. The planned intervention was to examine the effects of a psychostimulant on MT's level of arousal, in order to improve his participation in the rehabilitation programme. Beyond the results (which were equivocal), the clinical difficulties in conducting single case study designs in rehabilitation are discussed. Ways to minimize these difficulties are proposed.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/026990599121223,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article,England,eng

Currently, little is known of the mechanisms and cerebral changes that accompany those relatively rare cases of good recovery. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to study the evolution of one VS patient at one month post-ictus and again twelve months later when he had recovered consciousness. fMRI was used to investigate cortical responses to passive language stimulation as well as task-induced deactivations related to the default-mode network. DTI was used to assess the integrity of the global white matter and the arcuate fasciculus. We also performed a neuropsychological assessment at the time of the second MRI examination in order to characterize the profile of cognitive deficits. fMRI analysis revealed anatomically appropriate activation to speech in both the first and the second scans but a reduced pattern of task-induced deactivations in the first scan. In the second scan, following the recovery of consciousness, this pattern became more similar to that classically described for the default-mode network. DTI analysis revealed relative preservation of the arcuate fasciculus and of the global normal-appearing white matter at both time points. The neuropsychological assessment revealed recovery of receptive linguistic functioning by 12-months post-ictus. These results suggest that the combination of different structural and functional imaging modalities may provide a powerful means for assessing the mechanisms involved in the recovery from the VS.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,BMC neurology,10.1186/1471-2377-10-77,PMC2941677,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Two patterns have been described: dendriform, with a coral-like network of bone spiculae along the alveolar septa; and nodular, with lobulated fragments in the alveolar spaces. Dendriform DPO is frequently associated with chronic pulmonary pathologies. We present here the first case of DPO associated with a long-lasting vegetative state. Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) was applied to analyze the distribution of pulmonary ossification in volumes of lung samples. It showed a mean volume percentage of ossification of 0.79% and 3-D reconstructions permitted to reveal the branching pattern and internal cavities of some ossifications. The occurrence of DPO in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) may be favored by recurrent pulmonary infections, due to aspiration and immunological defects, and respiratory instability, due to brain damage and the fact of being bedridden. Fibrotic reactions probably represent a preliminary step in bone formation. Further studies could examine the incidence and clinical significance of DPO in subjects in PVS or patients who are bedridden for other reasons. MicroCT may facilitate analysis of more case histories, with greater sensitivity with respect to classic microscopic analyses.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Pathology international,10.1111/pin.12228,,MicroCT; lung; pulmonary ossification; vegetative state,Case Reports; Journal Article,Australia,eng

Recently, task appropriate differential regional activation in VS has been reported using fMRI during mental imagery. Demonstration of conscious awareness in reproducible differential EEG source localization images in a VS patient reflecting requested mental imagery was performed. A VS patient (with re-test) and a normal control were requested to imagine singing and to mentally perform serial subtraction, while EEG was recorded. QEEG source localization was performed to identify regions of brain activation in response to tasks. Replicable distinctive activation of brain areas appropriate for each task was seen in the VS patient and control. Frequency spectra shifted to beta, with significant source activation in regions including the bilateral anterior cingulate, insula, left caudate and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex to singing and the putamen, insula, left pre-frontal cortex and right temporal gyrus to subtraction by 7's. Results from this single case suggests the potential utility of QEEG source localization images to detect awareness in patients clinically diagnosed as being in VS. This indicates the possibility that EEG may serve as an important adjunct to the assessment of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness in the clinical setting.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2011.558045,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Our clinical and ethical decisions were further challenged by another facet of this complex case. Although her brain damage indicated a hopeless prognosis, we could not discontinue care based on futility because the only known surrogate was mentally retarded and unable to participate in medical planning. The presence of certain medical conditions prohibits a diagnosis of brain death, which is a medicolegal diagnosis of death, not a prediction or forecast of future outcome.

Profound brain damage can result in long-term states of altered consciousness such as vegetative and minimally conscious states. Differential diagnosis with this population is immensely complex requiring diverse approaches. Neuroimaging alone is not, as yet, sufficient to establish diagnosis in this population and must be supplemented by repeated behavioural observation methods from a skilled and diverse treatment team, as there are enormous medico-legal and ethical implications. Evidence from research in neuroimaging and the behavioural health sciences indicates that auditory stimulation can reveal residual functioning and elicit optimal behaviours in such patients, particularly when the stimulation has emotional significance. Behavioural assessment is complicated by limbic behaviours which can be misinterpreted as purposeful emotional responses. A case vignette using music therapy in a complex case illustrates such complications. Given the evidence for residual auditory functioning in patients in low awareness states, music is recommended as a medium for assessment. However, professionals involved in diagnosis must take caution against misinterpreting limbic responses and attributing greater meaning to such behaviours.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050701426907,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",England,eng

Usually, this occurs as the ""subclavian steal"" syndrome in the context of chronic subclavian stenosis and is consequently well tolerated because of collateralization. Acute disruption of the hemodynamics of the aortic arch vessels, however, can produce disastrous sequelae. We present three cases of iatrogenic vertebrobasilar insufficiency sustained as complications of surgery of the left subclavian artery or its distal continuation. The cases were chosen from a review of approximately 400 emergency neurosurgery consultations requested at the Los Angeles County Hospital between November 1995 and February 1996. The first patient underwent repair of a traumatic brachial artery occlusion and awoke postoperatively with bilateral cortical blindness, right hemiparesis, and multiple cranial nerve deficits that were most likely caused by acute subclavian steal. The second underwent removal of a subclavian embolus and developed bilateral cerebellar infarction leading to persistent coma, possibly from inadvertent embolization of the vertebral artery during surgery. The third underwent resection and bypass grafting of a subclavian aneurysm. Good backflow was reported when the vertebral artery was disarticulated from the subclavian artery, and this vessel was not reimplanted into the graft. The patient suffered massive cerebellar infarction leading rapidly to brain death. There are myriad ways in which the inherent redundancy of the vertebrobasilar system may be jeopardized, and when this protective mechanism fails, the results can be disastrous. Flow through the vertebral arteries may be compromised by thrombosis, embolization, dissection, inappropriate ligation, excessive head rotation, hypotension, vasospasm, or acute subclavian steal. These examples illustrate the importance of understanding the complex physiology of posterior fossa circulation as the basis of pre-, intra-, and postoperative management of patients undergoing surgery of the subclavian artery.",{},,Neurosurgery,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We selected a single adult patient operated upon by Cushing, whose respirations ceased in the operating room and who was maintained by the use of artificial respiration via a tracheostomy during a 36-hour period, whereas further surgical interventions were performed in an attempt to improve his condition. The patient's condition remained unimproved; artificial respirations were discontinued and the ""cessation of all cardiac activity"" was observed. Brain death is a concept that presents unique challenges to the practicing physician. Although recent advances have allowed for better diagnosis of brain death, the topic remains fraught with controversy. The case described here documents Harvey Cushing's struggles with the ethics of maintaining vital organ function with artificial respiration, despite clear evidence of irreversible ischemic brain damage.

We present a rehabilitative system that integrates neurorehabilitation into intensive care treatment. The system will be described using the case report of a young man who was in a vegetative state after a severe traumatic brain injury that resulted in major medical problems and complications. Despite these challenges, interdisciplinary therapies can be applied throughout the rehabilitative process. The patient in our case report showed significant improvements and functional gains during the course of treatment. Additional data from other patients support the feasibility of this system and show that integrating neurorehabilitation into intensive care treatment is possible and can lead to improved outcomes in this patient population. We will discuss the advantages, special features, and limitations of the system. Additional studies are needed to further demonstrate the efficacy of this approach compared with standard treatment.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,10.1016/j.apmr.2013.03.030,,ADL; CRS-R; Coma Recovery Scale-Revised; Consciousness disorders; DOCs; DRS; Disability Rating Scale; ICU; MCS; Persistent vegetative state; Rehabilitation; TBI; VS; activities of daily living; disorders of consciousness; intensive care unit; minimally conscious state; traumatic brain injury; vegetative state,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

First, the patient must have airway, breathing, and circulation protected. If the etiology of coma is in doubt, a broad metabolic screen is necessary. Table 5 demonstrates the major differences between structural and metabolic coma. Usually, history alone is sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis. If history or neurologic examination suggests a structural cause for the coma, then a cranial CT scan is mandatory. An electroencephalogram is often helpful, particularly in metabolic coma, and at times may even show structural abnormalities not demonstrated by CT scan. Rapid assessment and treatment is critical because coma is the clinical manifestation of brain failure, and often irreversible injury will occur if treatment is slow or incorrect.",{},,Primary care,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, in situations of organ retrieval from marginal DBDs, who are unstable despite intensive care, transplantation outcomes are not good. Organ ischemia is the most important determining factor in decreased organ quality in circulatory death donors and in some DBDs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for management of DBDs can be an emergency countermeasure. The purpose of this report is to relay our experience with four cases of ECMO for DBD management. In all four cases, the donors were unstable and showed clear signs of ischemia despite intensive care, including ventilator use and administration of inotropic agents. Two donors had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and two exhibited dysfunctional oxygen delivery. ECMO was used to improve organ perfusion. ECMO resulted in an increased partial pressure of arterial oxygen increased and decreased lactic acid levels. Vital signs were stabilized, especially in the donors who were bleeding. The organ was successfully retrieved from each donor. Two livers (one of them was split), eight kidneys, and one pancreas were retrieved from four DBDs. All other organs were transplanted successfully, and there were no cases of primary nonfunction or delayed graft function. The ECMO machine is the most powerful supportive device for management of unstable DBDs. The use of ECMO in unstable DBDs can be beneficial in expanding the donor pool as well as improving the quality of retrieved organs.",{},,Transplantation proceedings,10.1016/j.transproceed.2016.02.093,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The decision should be made by the attending physician in consultation with his peers. The life support mechanisms should be discontinued after the diagnosis of cerebral death has been made. Absence of pulsatile echoes means absence of cerebral circulation and cerebral function, or a definitive diagnosis of cerebral death.

The study aimed to evaluate the application of ERPs neuromarkers for the assessment and treatment of a patient with chronic crossed aphasia after severe TBI and a long-term coma. An ambidextrous female patient, aged 29, suffered from posttraumatic chronic crossed aphasia, severe TBI and a prolonged coma after a car accident. The patient took part in two differentiated rehabilitation programmes of neurotherapy included 20 sessions of relative beta training and 20 sessions of rTMS; both programmes were combined with behavioural training. The patient was tested 3 times: before the experiment, after completion of programme A, and after completion of programme B. In the 1st recording, the neuromarker of aphasia was found - an excess of the P2 wave over the left temporal area. There was a cognitive control deficit - an excess of omission errors and an increase of RT variability - all indexes of sporadic ADHD. In the 2nd recording, slight improvements in cognitive control, and language functions were found. In the 3rd recording, after the rTMS sessions most of her cognitive dysfunctions had been resolved, including language functions. It should be stressed that the activation (especially the increase in the ERP potential of the right side over the frontal lobe) was found. The neuromarker of aphasia did not change, only the location had slightly moved frontally. The application of ERP neuromarkers assists in the diagnosis, treatment, and academic success of an ambidextrous patient with chronic posttraumatic aphasia and sporadic ADHD.

Diffusion-weighted MRI is a new method sensitive to cerebral ischemia. Its value in brain death has not been demonstrated until now. A patient was referred to MRI with suspicion of a brain stem stroke. Echo-planar whole-brain, multislice, diffusion-weighted MRI was performed in addition to conventional sequences and MR angiography sequences. In addition to the extensive bilateral hyperintensities observed on T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted MRI showed diffuse hyperintensities involving both hemispheres as well as a severe drop in the apparent diffusion coefficient in both affected hemispheres. There was also transtentorial herniation with compression of the brain stem as well as absence of flow voids on the T2-weighted images and absence of intracranial vessels on MR angiography. On the basis of the clinical and imaging findings, it was concluded that the patient was in a state of brain death. The patient died the same day. With the use of new fast techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging, now MRI can not only display anatomic changes associated with severe brain suffering but can also demonstrate ultrastructural changes secondary to brain death and differentiate them from edematous changes seen on T2-weighted images.",{},,Stroke,10.1161/01.str.31.2.539,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Three vegetative state (VS), four minimal Conscious State (MCS) patients and 11 age- and sex-matched controls were examined. Evoked responses were obtained by 64 scalp electrodes, stimulating the dorsum of the right hand by noxious laser and innocuous electrical stimulus, according to normal controls subjective rating.

The LEP vertex complex was recognizable in all cases, with a significant latency increase of both N2 and P2 which displayed changes of topographic representation. Late SEPs were absent in all patients except in one MCS case, who showed a significant N2 and P2 latency increase.

When irreversible contractures are to be avoided, such a trial might be done earlier. Some have briefly reported cognitive modifications with this treatment. During the trial period, intrathecal baclofen is continuously infused by a portable external pump through an intrathecal catheter. The daily dose is adjusted according to the clinical response. If the expected response is obtained by reduction of spasticity, a programmable pump is then implanted. Throughout the procedure, close neuropsychological follow-up is pursued. Two persons with extremely severe brain injury and spasticity received a programmable pump less than 10 months after trauma. Unexpectedly, one emerged from the minimally conscious state and the other from post-traumatic amnesia. Intrathecal baclofen should be considered within the first year after brain injury whenever spasticity does not respond to medication.

After careful analysis of the ventilator settings, it was concluded that low trigger sensitivity and airway pressure oscillations during heart contractions were the reasons. Additionally, a few minutes later, spontaneous jerking movements of lower limbs and clonic movements of neck muscles secondary to painful stimuli were noticed. The situation became confusing; therefore, cerebral Doppler sonography was performed, showing circulatory arrest in both of the internal carotid, middle cerebral, and left vertebral arteries. The basilar artery was not visualized. Forward flow with increased pulsatility was recorded in extracranial and intracranial segments of the right vertebral artery. Cerebral circulatory arrest was still uncertain; therefore, the diagnostic procedures were completed with conventional cerebral angiography, which showed a lack of cerebral blood flow. Finally, the patient was declared brain dead; kidneys and bones were harvested. Cardiogenic oscillations associated with incorrect low ventilator trigger settings may falsely suggest persistence of breathing efforts in a brain-dead patient.

A 26-yr-old male with chronic otitis media presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 and fixed 7-mm pupils. Computed tomography demonstrated right-sided mastoiditis and a temporal lobe abscess associated with uncal herniation. The patient was diagnosed brain dead seven-hr later when motor responses and brainstem reflexes were absent and his apnea test was positive. Approximately 28-hr after NDD, during post-declaration organ resuscitation, the patient regained spontaneous respiration and magnetic resonance imaging revealed brain blood flow. Spontaneous respirations persisted for five-days before cardiovascular collapse occurred. In the second case, a 50-yr-old female presented with a GCS score of 3 and fixed 6-mm pupils following a traumatic brain injury and a five-minute cardiac arrest. The patient was deemed clinically brain dead six-hr later when physical examination revealed absent motor responses and brainstem reflexes and her apnea test was positive. As confirmation of brain death, a cerebral radionuclide angiogram was performed, which surprisingly revealed intracranial arterial flow. During organ resuscitation, 11-hr after NDD, the patient regained spontaneous respiration. She expired hours after family decision to withdraw treatment. For both patients, several unrecognized confounding factors for NDD were present. These cases illustrate the difficulties encountered by experienced clinicians in determining brain death using clinical criteria alone, and they suggest that more routine use of ancillary brain blood flow analyses should be recommended.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,10.1007/s12630-010-9359-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The role of the thalamus in the persistent vegetative state.,"Kinney, H C; Korein, J; Panigrahy, A; Dikkes, P; Goode, R",Kinney,"Karen Ann Quinlan had a cardiopulmonary arrest in 1975 and died 10 years later, having never regained consciousness. Her story prompted a national debate about the appropriateness of life-sustaining treatment in patients who are in a persistent vegetative state and led to the development of medicolegal guidelines for the care of such patients. This report describes the neuropathologic features of Quinlan's brain. The entire brain and spinal cord were systematically sampled for histologic examination. The brain stem and central cerebrum were embedded en bloc and serially sectioned. Three-dimensional computer reconstructions helped visualize the topographic features of the lesions. Contrary to expectation, the most severe damage was not in the cerebral cortex but in the thalamus, and the brain stem was relatively intact. The neuropathological findings included extensive bilateral thalamic scarring, bilateral cortical scars primarily in the occipital pole and parasagittal parieto-occipital region, and bilateral damage to cerebellar and focal-basal-ganglia regions. The brain stem and basal forebrain and the hypothalamic components of the ascending arousal systems and brainstem regions critical to cardiac and respiratory control were undamaged. The lesions were consistent with hypoxia-ischemia after the cardiopulmonary arrest. Although the neuropathological findings in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan were complex, the disproportionately severe damage in the thalamus as compared with the cerebral cortex supports the hypothesis that the thalamus is critical for cognition and awareness and may be less essential for arousal.",{},,The New England journal of medicine,10.1056/NEJM199405263302101,,,"Biography; Case Reports; Historical Article; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Case study. A patient in MCS was asked to 'imagine an unpleasant odour' or to 'relax' in response to the appearance on a screen of a downward pointing arrow or a cross, respectively. Electrophysiological responses to stimuli were investigated by means of an 8-channel EEG equipment and analysed using a specific threshold algorithm. The protocol was repeated for 10 sessions separated from each other by 2 weeks. Accuracy, defined as the number of successes with respect to the total number of trials, was used to evaluate the number of times in which the classification strategy was successful. Analyses of accuracy showed that the patient was able to activate and to relax himself purposefully and that he optimized his performances with the number of sessions, probably as a result of training-related improvements. Subtle signs of consciousness may be under-estimated and need to be revealed through specific activation tasks. This paradigm may be useful to detect covert signs of consciousness, especially when patients are precluded from carrying out more complex cognitive tasks.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Brain injury,10.3109/02699052.2015.1075251,,"EEG; imagery; minimally conscious state; unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; vegetative state, task",Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

9854265,Coordinated expression in chronically unconscious persons.,"Plum, F; Schiff, N; Ribary, U; Llin√°s, R",Plum,"The clinically described 'persistent vegetative state' (PVS), consists of wakefulness unaccompanied by any evidence of the subject's awareness of self or environment. Past studies from our own and other laboratories have used positron emission tomography (PET) to study brain metabolism in approximately 20 such patients during wakeful periods. All those efforts identified global cerebral glucose metabolism at or below levels encountered during deep barbiturate anaesthesia. Nevertheless, the clinical literature includes rare reports of relatively isolated cognitive functions expressed by PVS patients late in their course. The observation raises the question of whether such activity reflects awareness or unconscious automatic behaviour. We employed magnetometry (MEG), PET scanning, MR imaging and 24-hour EEG recordings to evaluate three patients clinically vegetative between six months and 20 years after onset. Neither meticulous clinical examinations nor 24-hour EEG and video monitoring provided any hint of cognitive interaction in any subject. Nevertheless, patient 1 uttered single words once every 48 hours or more; patient 2 frequently expressed coordinated, non-purposeful, non-dystonic movements in arms and/or legs; and, patient 3 expressed strong emotional negativity without motor responses to noxious stimuli with occasional quieting in response to prosodic stimuli. All patients had whole-brain averaged global metabolism levels below 50% of normal. Patient 1, however, demonstrated preserved islands of increased metabolism in the posterior frontal and posterior temporal lobes, as well as MEG activations of Heschl's gyrus all located in the left hemisphere. In patient 2, selected increased metabolism was confined to the frontal poles and related subcortical structures. MRI in patient 3 demonstrated severe, bilateral post-traumatic cerebral atrophy. PET metabolism was diffusely reduced to 40% of normal but MEG evoked potentials indicated early and late sensory processing with abnormal later evoked components. The correlation of fragmentary behaviour with preserved metabolic and physiologic activity in cortical and subcortical regions known to support specific modular functions is novel. The finding demonstrates the capacity of severely damaged brains to partially express surviving modular functions without evidence of integrative processes that would be necessary to produce consciousness. We conclude that the mere expression of isolated neuropsychologic activity by isolated modules is insufficient to generate consciousness in overwhelmingly damaged brains.",{},,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The degree of consciousness varies from coma to vegetative state or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state. Correct diagnosis has important ethical and legal implications, and pain may be cause of misdiagnosis. We describe here a patient with traumatic brain injury, classified as UWS. His clinical picture was dominated by spasticity, and pain. He underwent intrathecal treatment of spasticity with baclofen. Improvement was not that expected. However, there was a dramatic improvement when ziconotide was added to relieve pain; the patient began to eat by mouth, talk, and his tracheal tube could be removed and he is currently classified as having severe disability. The suspension of ziconotide caused a clear re-worsening of clinical condition, reverted by his reintroduction. Pain is an important factor in patients with DOC. Anecdotal reports of improved consciousness with intrathecal baclofen therapy may be due to pain relief. Reduction of pain in DOC is important and drugs should not interfere with cognition, and must be effective and manageable. Ziconotide may be one of the possible candidate due to its synergistic antispastic action in combination with baclofen when an intratecal pump has been implanted.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

We asked whether there is a common neural code that underpins similar conscious experiences, which could be used to decode these experiences in the absence of behavior. To this end, we used richly evocative stimulation (an engaging movie) portraying real-world events to elicit a similar conscious experience in different people. Common neural correlates of conscious experience were quantified and related to measurable, quantitative and qualitative, executive components of the movie through two additional behavioral investigations. The movie's executive demands drove synchronized brain activity across healthy participants' frontal and parietal cortices in regions known to support executive function. Moreover, the timing of activity in these regions was predicted by participants' highly similar qualitative experience of the movie's moment-to-moment executive demands, suggesting that synchronization of activity across participants underpinned their similar experience. Thus we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that a neural index based on executive function reliably predicted every healthy individual's similar conscious experience in response to real-world events unfolding over time. This approach provided strong evidence for the conscious experience of a brain-injured patient, who had remained entirely behaviorally nonresponsive for 16 y. The patient's executive engagement and moment-to-moment perception of the movie content were highly similar to that of every healthy participant. These findings shed light on the common basis of human consciousness and enable the interpretation of conscious experience in the absence of behavior.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,10.1073/pnas.1407007111,PMC4191782,brain injury; disorders of consciousness; fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Serum concentrations of the destruction proteins, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and protein S-100B (S-100B), were measured on days 1-3, and 7; somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded within 48 h and on day 7 after CA. Two patients had significantly increased concentrations of NSE and S-100B during the first 3 days after CA, a finding that indicates ongoing neuronal destruction. In contrast, the SEPs of these patients were normal or showed only a diminished amplitude configuration. In the third patient the SEPs demonstrated a bilateral loss of cortical responses repeatedly, but both destruction proteins were only slightly above the upper normal values on all study days. Our findings demonstrate that a poor prognosis can only be established if either SEPs, NSE, or S-100B are very abnormal. The conflicting results in our patients indicate that variable values may reflect different patterns of neuropathological damage caused by diffuse hypoxia. We, therefore, favour a multi-modal approach with a combination of clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological investigations in order to predict neurological outcome after CA reliably.",{},,Resuscitation,10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.11.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Ireland,eng
25914956,Lung Procurement from a Donor on ECMO Support.,"Dewei, Ren; Abu Saleh, Walid K; Al Jabbari, Odeaa; Ramlawi, Basel; Bruckner, Brian A; Suarez, Eddie; Loebe, Matthias",Dewei,"We report the case of a 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure who became a candidate for organ donation after anoxic brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) who was on a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. On visualization, the donor's lung was acceptable for lung transplantation to a 68-year-old male patient with a chronic history of pulmonary fibrosis. Right single-lung implantation was successfully performed in the recipient. Herein, we report a case that highlights our institution's result suggesting that the use of a lung previously on ECMO support can safely and potentially expand the donor lung pool in carefully selected patients.",{},,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),10.1097/MAT.0000000000000249,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
21672290,[Communication with the relatives of a patient presumed brain dead].,"Kompanje, Erwin J O; de Groot, Yorick J; Ijzermans, Jan N M; Visser, Gerhard H; Bakker, Jan; van der Jagt, Mathieu",Kompanje,"The choice of wording in cases of suspected brain death is important. If brain death has not been proven by electrocerebral silence and by absence of spontaneous breathing in an apnoea test in a patient in intensive care, then words like 'brain dead', 'has died' and 'clinical brain death' should be avoided in conversations with the relatives of the patient. This is illustrated by three cases. The first patient was a 46-year-old woman, with thrombosis of the basilar artery; the second was a 26-year-old man who was resuscitated after a bilateral pneumothorax, but developed severe postanoxic encephalopathy; and the third patient was a 64-year-old man with a large intracerebral haemorrhage. The relatives were informed that the patient was 'brain dead' or 'deceased' based on loss of consciousness (Glasgow Coma score of 3) and absence of brain stem reflexes, but prior to the completion of the brain death protocol by electroencephalography and apnoea testing. In the first and third cases, brain death could not be proven, and the pronouncement that the patient was deceased had to be reversed. The emotional relatives refused organ donation. In the second case, death was pronounced upon loss of consciousness and absence of brain stem reflexes. The relatives refused organ donation, after which mechanical ventilation was withdrawn and the patient was declared dead for a second time based on circulatory arrest. A patient is dead after complete brain death determination or after circulatory arrest. Loss of consciousness (Glasgow Coma score of 3) and absence of brain stem reflexes lead to a state of catastrophic cerebral damage, but not to brain death. In such a situation, wording such as 'brain death', 'deceased' and 'clinical brain death' should be avoided in conversations with the relatives.",{},,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,dut
