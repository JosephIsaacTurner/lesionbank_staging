37149895,A case report of acquired synesthesia and heightened creativity in a musician after traumatic brain injury.,"Abou-Khalil, Rima; Acosta, Lealani Mae Y",Abou-Khalil,"We report on a musician who acquired synesthesia, enhanced sensory experience, and improved creativity following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Creativity and synesthesia can be acquired from an injury, though both simultaneously has not been frequently documented. This case report details heightened creativity and developing synesthesia in a 66-year-old right-handed man following TBI. He developed a ""compulsion"" to write music. Synesthesia included ""seeing"" the notation and being able to name chord structures of music he heard, both of which were novel experiences. The Synesthesia Battery revealed a vision-sound synesthesia with higher than average level of Vividness of Visual Imagery (VVIQ-2), and ""Absolute Pitch/Perfect Pitch."" The patient experienced an approximate four-month history of these changes, including musical compositions, developing perfect pitch, and enhanced sensory experience of typical phenomena. Both creativity and synesthesia depend on novel connections in the brain, and both have been reported following insults to the brain, including in degenerative conditions. However, the development of both simultaneously is not frequently reported. Evidence for the etiology of one prompting the other has not been described. Brain injury may result in increased creativity and synesthesia. Our fields would benefit from increased awareness of this possible relationship.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2023.2208271,,Creativity; music; music composition; synesthesia; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

17893864,Feeling sounds after a thalamic lesion.,"Ro, Tony; Farn√®, Alessandro; Johnson, Ruth M; Wedeen, Van; Chu, Zili; Wang, Zhiyue J; Hunter, Jill V; Beauchamp, Michael S",Ro,"The ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VL), based on its connectivity with the cerebellum and motor cortex, has long been considered to be involved with motor functions. We show that the human VL also plays a prominent role in sensory processing. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were used to localize a small lesion restricted to the right VL in a patient with contralesional sensory processing deficits. Systematic assessments of anatomic brain organization and behavioral measurements of somatosensory and visual processing were conducted at several time points after stroke. Initially, the patient was more likely to detect events on the contralesional side when a simultaneous ipsilesional event was presented within the same, but not different, sensory modality. This perceptual phenomenon, which we refer to as unisensory antiextinction, persisted for several months before transforming into a form of synesthesia in which auditory stimuli produced tactile percepts. Tractography performed on the diffusion tensor imaging data showed altered connections from the lesioned thalamus to the cerebral cortex, suggesting a neural basis for these sensory changes. These results demonstrate a role for the VL in sensory processing and suggest that reorganization of thalamocortical axonal connectivity can lead to major changes in perception.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.21219,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

Based on our review of the literature, the appearance of synesthesias after a thalamic stroke has been reported only once. We present the case of a 45-year-old hypertensive male who, 9 months after a hemorrhagic stroke involving the left lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus developed persistent sound-tactile, sound-color, and grapheme-gustatory synesthesias. Moreover, the patient noted that even thinking about a sensory stimulus could trigger the experience of another sensory modality, a conceptual type of synesthesia.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2011.608362,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
