35630076,Wernicke Encephalopathy Mimicking MELAS.,"Finsterer, Josef",Finsterer,"a stroke-like lesion, the morphological equivalent of a stroke-like episode and the hallmark of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, have not been reported as manifestations of thiamine deficiency. a 62-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted after a series of epileptic seizures. Upon waking up from the coma, he presented with disorientation, confusion, confabulation, psychomotor agitation, aggressiveness, right hemianopsia, aphasia, and right hemineglect over weeks. Electroencephalography showed a questionable focal status epilepticus over the left hemisphere, responsive to lorazepam and oxcarbazepine. Follow-up electroencephalographies no longer recorded epileptiform discharges. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2-/diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity in the left occipito-temporal region that was not congruent to a vascular territory which persisted for at least nine weeks. Since a lactate-peak could be seen in this lesion by magnetic resonance-spectroscopy, this was interpreted as a stroke-like lesion. Since thiamine was reduced, the stroke-like lesion was attributed to thiamine deficiency after the exclusion of differential diseases, including MELAS and status epilepticus. The patient's behavioural and cognitive dysfunctions largely resolved upon vitamin-B1 substitution. the case suggests that thiamine deficiency presumably causes mitochondrial dysfunction with cerebrospinal fluid lactic acidosis and a stroke-like lesion mimicking MELAS syndrome. It should be further studied whether nutritional deficits, such as thiamine deficiency, could give rise to secondary stroke-like lesions.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",10.3390/medicina58050660,PMC9144475,Wernicke encephalopathy; lactic acidosis; spectroscopy; stroke-like episode; stroke-like lesion; thiamine deficiency,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

37860783,Anton syndrome with bilateral occipital infarct: A case report.,"Mankoo, Dylan",Mankoo,"Anton syndrome results from damage to the visual cortex of the occipital lobes, where the anterior visual pathways remain intact. This damage results in the characteristic triad of cortical blindness, visual anosognosia, and visual confabulation. This case describes an 80-year-old male with a background of renal transplant 7 years prior, admitted to hospital with worsening transplant function, and soon after developed sudden onset cortical blindness. On examination, the patient was found to be in denial of his blindness and showed signs of visual confabulation, both of which pointed toward a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. Radiological investigation with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral ischemic stroke of the occipital lobes, which was later theorized to have occurred due to sirolimus-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of sirolimus-induced TMA, bilateral ischemic occipital lobe stroke, and Anton's syndrome, within the same diagnosis. This case highlights that a diagnosis of bilateral occipital stroke with denial of blindness should suggest a diagnosis of Anton syndrome. This report also discusses the importance of differentiating bilateral occipital infarction on CT imaging, from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), using MRI.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '10'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Radiology case reports,10.1016/j.radcr.2023.09.036,PMC10582287,Anton syndrome; Neuroradiology; Stroke,Case Reports,Netherlands,eng

He thus has ""crossed"" somatoparaphrenia; (2) his delusional misidentification concerned the right leg and not the arm or hand; (3) he has no anosognosia; (4) his proprioception is disturbed for the leg only; and (5) the lesion site is very posterior, a left occipito-parietal haemorrhage without involvement of the frontal lobe or the posterior insula.

In the acute phase, our patients showed bilateral medial thalamic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging findings were similar to those of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Although these findings improved in the chronic phase, neuropsychiatric sequelae, such as confabulation and amnesia, occurred.

18609017,False selves in neuropsychological rehabilitation: the challenge of confabulation.,"Fotopoulou, Aikaterini",Fotopoulou,"The presence of confabulation following brain damage can obstruct neuropsychological rehabilitation and management. A recent theoretical approach to confabulation emphasises that neurocognitive deficits are not sufficient to account for the content of confabulation. As a result, they are also insufficient to address the unique rehabilitation challenges that confabulation raises. Instead, confabulation could be best understood as the magnification of existing reconstructive memory processes, influenced by both neurocognitive and motivational factors. The paper reviews recent experimental findings showing that confabulations serve important functions of self-coherence and self-enhancement, despite their poor correspondence to reality. Case material is used to illustrate the meaningfulness of confabulation from the subjective perspective of the patient and to demonstrate that such a theoretical approach to confabulation can best inform management and rehabilitation efforts.",{},,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602010802083545,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

Advanced anatomical investigation suggested a disconnection between the parietal and the temporal lobes in the right hemisphere. A disconnection between the ventral cortical visual stream and the dorsal fronto-parietal networks in the right hemisphere may contribute to confabulatory behaviour by restricting processing of left-sided stimuli to pre-conscious stages in the ventral visual stream.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-018-5281-8,,Confabulation; Implicit knowledge; Neglect,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
38347991,Silent Echoes: A Case Report of Wernicke Encephalopathy's Unheard Voice.,"Gafoor, Stefan; Robertson, Raheem",Gafoor,"Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neuropsychiatric emergency that is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine). This condition is most commonly seen in patients with alcohol use disorder; however, patients with other disorders of severe malnourishment are also at increased risk. In severe cases, this disease may be followed by Korsakoff's psychosis and even death.  We present a case of a 64-year-old African American female with a history of alcohol use disorder who presented to the emergency department on account of an acute confusional state. Neurological examination revealed right beating nystagmus on the left gaze and a wide-based gait. Initial laboratory work-up was unrevealing; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated an abnormal T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal involving the bilateral mammillary bodies and surrounding lateral ventricles that extended into the periaqueductal parenchyma. The patient was admitted to the neurology unit, and high-dose intravenous thiamine was commenced. During hospitalization, the patient's confusion improved and they were subsequently discharged with oral thiamine. The spectrum of severity of WE is wide, ranging from fatal disease and can lead to permanent brain damage or even Korsakoff syndrome, characterized by severe memory loss and confabulation. The diagnosis is mainly clinical and based on the presence of symptoms in the classic triad of mental status change, oculomotor abnormality, and ataxia. This triad is only present in about 10% of cases, making the diagnosis very challenging. Laboratory testing can assist in making the diagnosis, but it is not always reliable or available. In situations of clinical uncertainty, imaging may also be used to support diagnosis or rule out other differentials.

11865559,[Post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome: clinical and anatomical report].,"Brion, S; Plas, J; Mikol, J; Jeanneau, A; Brion, F",Brion,"Clinical and anatomical report of a post traumatic amnestic syndrome (Korsakoff's syndrome), associating anterograde amnesia persisting for fifteen years, with temporal disorientation, false recognitions, initially intense transitory confabulation and secondarily bursts of confabulation, intact remote memory and persistence of old learnings. Death after twelve years from mesenteric infarction. Anatomically, post-traumatic sequellae are limited to both cingulate gyri in their anterior part. This cingula involvement is easy to understand if one knows that post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome appears after severe cranial traumatisms, with at least three days of coma, and develops constantly, even if transitory, after long duration comas with 20 to 30 days of loss of consciousness. Anatomical explanation depends on the fact that Korsakoff's syndromes from various etiologies need, to be produced, a bilateral damage of the limbic circuit and that severe head traumatisms, when dying early in the evolution without possibility of a neuro-psychological investigation, have always a destruction of corpus callosum or cingulate gyri or both, resulting from crushing of these structures by the edge of the faulx cerebri. Consistent with these constatations, it is logical that a Korsakoff's syndrome develops after severe head traumas with bilateral lesions of the limbic circuit and especially of the cingulate gyri. But anatomical evidence remains rare, because early fatal evolution does not permit psychological evaluation and, reversely, long survivals who may die from another pathology would not have brain examination. We prefer the name of ""Korsakoff's syndrome"" rather than that of ""amnesic syndrome"" to denominate the anterograd amnesia (amnésie des faits récents) encountered in nutritional disorders due to B1 deficiency in true Korsakoff's disease, but also with other etiologies such as cerebral tumours, vascular cerebral disorders, post-commital anoxia, herpetic encephalopathy, head traumas, all of them developing amnesia for recent events, formerly classified under the title of ""korsakowian syndrome"" or ""mental syndrome of Korsakoff"" and more recently under the denomination of ""amnesic syndrome"". But whatever is the etiology of the memory disorder, the amnesic syndrome remains identical and the advanced small differences, such as euphoria in alcoholics or mood depression in tumours, are often fallacious, so that the only way of differentiation deals with accessory symptoms such as intracranial hypertension in tumours, sudden onset in vascular etiologies or polyneuritis in B1 deficiency. Post-traumatic Korsakoff's syndrome joins with this scheme, for its clinical aspect is so similar to that of nutritional disorders that it might be difficult to reach the exact diagnosis when an alcohol addict develops, after a head trauma, an amnesia which could be the consequence of the trauma but also of a nutritional disorder developed after the accident with inadequate parenteral treatment. Our case, which is the first well documented observation of this disease reported with long clinical survey and final pathological examination, was presented in 1981 at a joint meeting of the French and Dutch neurological societies. It gives the proof of the importance, in limbic circuit, of the cingulate gyri. A comparison is made with four other clinical cases of post traumatic amnestic syndrome with MNR procedures which show, for two of them, cingula lesions explaining the clinical features, for one of them a bilateral lesion of Ammon's homs and for the last one extra-limbic lesions, with destruction of the inferior part of both frontal lobes, associated with a possible deafferentation of the right cingula cortex.",{},,L'Encephale,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,France,fre

In a 77 year old lady, with a prior history of a clinically silent infarct of the left MDN, we observed the acute onset of spontaneous confabulations when an isolated new infarct occurred in the right MDN. The patient and five age-matched healthy subjects underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The thalamic lesions were localized by overlapping Morel Thalamic Atlas with structural MRI data. DTI was used to assess: i) white matter alterations (Fractional Anisotropy, FA) within fibers connecting the ischemic areas to cortex; ii) the micro-structural damage (Mean Diffusivity) within the thalamic sub-regions defined by their structural connectivity to the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and to the temporal lobes. These target regions were chosen because their damage is considered associated with the appearance of confabulations. Thalamic lesions were localized within the parvocellular regions of the right and left MDNs. The structural connectivity study showed that the fiber tracts, connecting the bilaterally damaged thalamic regions with the frontal cortex, corresponded to the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). FA within these tracts was significantly lower in the patient as compared to controls. Mean diffusivity within the MDNs projecting to Broadman area (BA) 24, BA25 and BA32 of ACC was significantly higher in the patient than in control group. Mean diffusivity values within the MDN projecting to temporal lobes in contrast were not different between patient and controls. Our findings suggest the involvement of bilateral MDNs projections to ACC in the genesis of confabulations and help provide clarity to the longstanding debate on the origin of confabulations.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,NeuroImage.

It has a unique neuropsychiatric presentation and should be highly suspected in those with odd visual loss and imaging evidence of occipital lobe injury. In the case discussed herein, a 90-year-old man presented with bilateral blindness, obvious anosognosia, and vivid visual confabulation, which he had had for 3 days. Brain computed tomography demonstrated recent hypodense infarctions at the bilateral occipital lobes. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with Anton-Babinski syndrome. Because of his age and the thrombolytic therapy during the golden 3 hours after ischemic stroke, the patient received aspirin therapy rather than tissue plasminogen activator or warfarin. He gradually realized he was blind during the following week, but died of pneumonia 1 month later. In the literature, it is difficult to establish awareness of blindness in patients with Anton-Babinski syndrome, but optimistically, in one report, a patient was aware of blindness within 2 weeks, without vision improvement.

10871831,Confabulation and multiple sclerosis: a rare association.,"Feinstein, A; Levine, B; Protzner, A",Feinstein,"Fantastic confabulation in the context of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has not previously been reported in the literature. The association is of interest because clearly demonstrable brain pathology in MS together with other cognitive and behavioural correlates may further our understanding of the neural basis underlying confabulation. A single case report with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and detailed neuropsychological evaluation. Confabulation occurred together with disinhibited and stimulus bound behaviour. While the patient's physical and emotional state limited the range of psychometric tests administered, the results revealed an inability to maintain focused, regulated information processing. Although memory difficulties were present, they were not in the nature of a severe amnesic disorder. The patient appeared to have a broad fund of knowledge, but the associations binding the information together and putting it into context were loose. All three features of a triad of responses previously described in confabulating patients were present, namely an inability to withhold answers, to monitor one's own responses and provide verbal self corrections. MRI of the brain showed bilateral periventricular lesions and discrete frontal lesions with 53% of the total lesion volume distributed in frontal areas.

8124934,Different patterns of confabulation.,"Dalla Barba, G",Dalla Barba,"In this study we investigated the amnesic-confabulatory condition of two patients, M.B. and S.D., exhibiting different patterns of confabulation. Neuropsychological examination showed in M.B. a normal intellectual efficiency and a selective deficit of episodic memory, whereas S.D. was impaired in tests of intellectual efficiency, episodic memory, semantic knowledge and frontal functions. The relation of confabulation to retrieval conditions and the degree of impairment of the semantic memory system was investigated with a set of questions involving the retrieval of various kinds of information. In M.B. confabulation was restricted to episodic memory tasks, whereas in S.D. it also affected the retrieval of semantic information. S.D.'s confabulatory reports were 'semantically anomalous', whereas the semantic structure of M.B.'s confabulations was appropriate. Further investigation using the encoding specificity paradigm showed an interaction of encoding/retrieval conditions in M.B. but not in S.D. This pattern of results is discussed in terms of a different level of disruption of processes that normally monitor the retrieval of information. It is further argued that the confabulation content must be considered in terms of its semantic structure and relies on the level of integrity of semantic knowledge.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80281-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

However, it is most common in the acute phase, with persistent confabulation being comparatively rare. In this paper, we describe the case of Joe, a 24-year-old man who showed confabulation in the chronic phase of his rehabilitation, three years after traumatic brain injury. We describe our approach to therapy for this confabulation, and in particular how collaborative formulation enabled Joe to understand his confabulation, and then to manage it effectively, using a diary and ""detective"" procedure to identify whether or not evidence existed to support potentially confabulated memories. Furthermore, we include Joe's own perspective on what it is like to be confabulating, and on his experience of rehabilitation. This is an example of a successful insight-based therapeutic intervention, which is rare in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first example of a first-person perspective on confabulation.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2017.1397031,,False memory; Management; Psychological therapy; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The patient underwent a series of brain imaging investigations (CT and MRI) and neuropsychological investigations to determine the severity and course of behavioural and cognitive impairments. Three months post-injury, the patient demonstrated dense retrograde and anterograde amnesia for auditory-verbal and visuo-spatial information, disorientation and confabulation. In contrast, memory for faces appeared unimpaired. One month later the patient's behaviour, orientation and spatial memory had improved with no concomitant improvement in auditory-verbal memory. The findings indicate that injury to the diencephalon manifests in a verbal amnesic syndrome that is anterograde in nature if localized in the region of the anterior left thalamus, but leaves a relatively intact visual memory. Furthermore, injuries to the frontal and temporal lobes and their projections to the diencephalon may be more important in the emergence and resolution of retrograde amnesia and disturbances in autobiographical recall than previously appreciated.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/02699050802649647,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Although alcoholism is the most common predisposing factor, it can also be associated with nonalcoholic states (hyperemesis gravidarum, intestinal obstruction, bariatric surgery, and others). This work presents a case of nonalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome diagnosed in a cholangiocellular carcinoma patient and literature review. A 65-year-old male patient with a history of cholangiocellular carcinoma (Klatskin tumor) was treated with radiotherapy at the operation site after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. During follow-up, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction and was diagnosed with peritoneal carcinomatosis after a palliative gastrojejunostomy. As the patient could not tolerate oral nutrition during hospitalization, total parenteral nutrition was administered. After 10 days of admission, the patient showed decreased response to verbal stimuli as well as bilateral horizontal nystagmus, lethargy, and disorientation. Furthermore, the patient displayed confabulation. Clinical and imaging findings were consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, treatment with intravenous thiamin replacement was initiated. The patient's encephalopathy regressed on the second day after treatment, and he recovered the place-person-time orientation. In the following month, the abnormal imaging findings were almost entirely resolved. In order to prevent irreversible brain damage induced by chronic thiamin deficiency, thiamin replacement therapy with parenteral nutrition solutions should be included as a treatment for hospitalized cancer patients unable to receive enteral nutrition for a long time.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000031904,PMC9726370,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, there is a paucity of information regarding the persistence of these symptoms following traumatic brain injury. We present the case of JL, a 43-year-old male with persistent and severe anterograde amnesia for verbal and visual information with co-occurring provoked confabulation which persists well into the chronic phase of recovery after a severe traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing at 7 weeks post-injury demonstrated severe anterograde amnesia with co-occurring confabulation. Follow-up testing at 9.5 months post-injury showed persistent and severe anterograde amnesia and provoked confabulation despite superior non-verbal intelligence and above average attentional and perceptual abilities. Late computed tomography showed chronic hypodense regions in the temporal lobes, bilaterally (L > R), and in the region of the left ventrolateral frontal lobe. This case demonstrates that anterograde amnesia and provoked confabulation may persist long after the acute phase of recovery after traumatic brain injury, and also supports previous research which asserts that medial temporal lobe damage must be accompanied by ventral frontal lobe pathology to produce the amnestic-confabulatory syndrome.",{},,Neurocase,10.1093/neucas/7.4.295,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report this phenomenon in a 33 yr-old, right-handed man (JG) in association with the extension in the right thalamus of a previously small, bilateral thalamic lesion. JG presented with a dense amnesia for autobiographical material more than a few years old, with some sparing of recent memories. Furthermore, he was completely unable to recognise famous people or world events. Many other aspects of semantic knowledge were intact and there was no evidence of general intellectual impairment, executive dysfunction or loss of visual imagery. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute lesion in the right thalamus and two small, symmetrical, bilateral non-acute thalamic lesions. Follow-up neuropsychological assessment indicated a stable pattern of impaired retrograde and spared anterograde memory over 18 months and psychiatric assessments yielded no evidence of confabulation, malingering or other symptoms to suggest psychogenic amnesia. JG's profile indicates that the division of declarative memory into just two categories - episodic and semantic - is inadequate. Rather, his case adds to the growing body evidence to suggest that world knowledge pertaining to people and events is stored or accessed similarly to autobiographical information and differently from other types of more general factual knowledge. We hypothesize that the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and immediately surrounding regions comprise the central processing mechanism referred to by McClelland (Revue Neurologique, 150 (1994) 570) and Markowitsch (Brain Research Review, 21 (1995) 117) as responsible for inducing and co-ordinating the recall of these sorts of cortically stored memory engrams.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00041-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Based on Hughling Jackson's (1884/1958) notion of the duality of the symptom, we proposed a model of the development and process of psychopathology following brain injury, which views the development of the psychopathological behavior as a product of acquired cognitive and perceptual defects and ensuing compensatory strategies. For the present case study of paranoia, this involved defects in long-term memory, conceptual ability, and compensatory strategies of confabulation and self-referential orientation. Neuropsychological testing established defects in concept formation tasks including the Raven Progressive Matrices, the Leiter International Performance Scale, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting test, as well as long-term memory defects where cognitive reorganization was needed. The paranoid process was understood as a product of disordered conceptual ability in interpersonal situations, and a self-referential conceptual classification system, which took time, and changed social relations, to emerge. The implications of this model for psychotherapy with brain injury is elaborated in our case study, in which psychotherapeutic intervention included training on interpersonal hypothesis formation.",{},,Journal of clinical neuropsychology,10.1080/01688638308401150,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

This study investigated the role of personal biases in the confabulations of six patients with diverse aetiologies. Confabulations were elicited with a series of structured interviews. We then compared the patients' confabulations to their actual situations. Further analyses compared confabulations about current (i.e., the postmorbid period) and past (i.e., premorbid events and general life circumstances) events. Group analysis confirmed a general bias to recall events that were more positive than the reality. However, examination of individual cases revealed that positive biases were not universal. Confabulations about current circumstances showed the positive bias, whereas an emotional bias was not evident in past confabulations. We conclude that motivational forces play a role in determining the content of confabulations but conceive of this role primarily in terms of a need to maintain a consistent self-concept (whether positive or negative) overlaid upon the ease with which an individual can retrieve familiar premorbid daily activities and routines.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,10.1080/13546800902767703,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Here, we describe a 38-year-old woman lawyer hospitalized because of non-herpetic, presumably autoimmune, limbic encephalitis. For months, she considered herself at work and desperately tried to respect her falsely believed professional obligations. In contrast to a completely erroneous concept of reality, she did not confabulate about her remote personal past. In tasks proposed to test strategic retrieval monitoring, she produced no confabulations. As expected, she failed in tasks of reality filtering, previously shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for behaviorally spontaneous confabulation and disorientation: she failed to suppress the interference of currently irrelevant memories and she had deficient extinction capacity. The observation underscores the special status of behaviorally spontaneous confabulation among confabulatory phenomena and of reality filtering as a thought control mechanism. We suggest that different processes may underlie the generation of false memories and their verbal expression. We also emphasize the need to present theories of confabulation together with experimental tasks that allow one to empirically verify the theories and to explore underlying physiological mechanisms.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,10.1017/S1355617710000780,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

On a number of recognition tasks, the patients were found to have high levels of false positives. They also made a large number of guess responses but otherwise appeared metacognitively intact. Informal reports suggested that the episodes of déjà vecu were characterised by sensations similar to those present when the past is recollectively experienced in normal remembering. Two further experiments found that both patients had high levels of recollective experience for items they falsely recognized. Most strikingly, they were likely to recollectively experience incorrectly recognised low frequency words, suggesting that their false recognition was not driven by familiarity processes or vague sensations of having encountered events and stimuli before. Importantly, both patients made reasonable justifications for their false recognitions both in the experiments and in their everyday lives and these we term 'recollective confabulation'. Thus, the patients are characterised by false recognition, overextended recollective experience, and recollective confabulation. These features are accounted for in terms of disrupted control of memory awareness and recollective states, possibly following brain damage to fronto-temporal circuits and we extend this account to normally and abnormally occurring states of déjà vu and vecu and related memory experiences.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.12.008,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
18270272,Recovery from amnesic confabulatory syndrome after right fornix lesion.,"Ruggeri, Massimiliano; Sabatini, Umberto",Ruggeri,"Reports of amnesia due to bilateral fornix lesions are rare. A unilateral right fornix lesion is not known to cause an amnestic confabulatory syndrome. To investigate the role of right fornix lesion in amnesia, the association of confabulation with executive disorders, and to evaluate the long-term recovery of memory and executive functions after surgical removal of a pilocytic astrocytoma in the right orbitofrontal region extending to the right fornix. Neuropsychological testing was performed 3 and 17 months after surgery. Severe anterograde global amnesia, mild retrograde amnesia, momentary and spontaneous confabulation, and mild executive deficits were found initially and mostly recovered by 17 months. The authors hypothesize that the lesion of the right fornix was sufficient to cause amnesia by disconnecting the hippocampal formations from the anterior thalamic nuclei and mammillary bodies and interrupting the cholinergic efferents to the hippocampus from the medial septum, according to the extended hippocampal system framework. Sparing of the left fornix may be sufficient to ensure a good recovery of memory. Confabulation is strongly associated with the improvement of executive functions, specifically the ability to suppress irrelevant memory traces.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,10.1177/1545968307313506,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

18416482,Models of confabulation: a critical review and a new framework.,"Metcalf, Kasey; Langdon, Robyn; Coltheart, Max",Metcalf,"Confabulation can be defined as statements or actions that involve distortions of memories. This paper reviews current theories of confabulation focusing on source monitoring, temporal-context, and retrieval theories. The attributes and criticisms of these three models are discussed. From this review, a three-factor cognitive-neuropsychological framework is proposed, which can be used to explain the variable symptoms of confabulation. The framework takes its basis from the Langdon and Coltheart (2000a, 2000b) cognitive model of delusional belief formation. The model suggests that two deficits are likely in most cases of confabulation - an executive control retrieval deficit and an evaluation deficit. It also takes into consideration how the general organization of the autobiographical memory store and a person's individual emotional/motivational biases can influence confabulatory symptoms and content. This is an overarching framework that can be used to model confabulations, and it builds upon links between delusions and confabulation.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290600694901,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Besides elevated inflammatory marker with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 130 mm/hr, her infectious, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and neuromyelitis optica work-up was overall unremarkable. Brain MRI showed abnormal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signaling in bilateral mammillary bodies and around periaqueductal gray matter concerning WE.

The patient was also later found to have a positive anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody, which was deemed false positive given the atypical phenotype and symptomatic improvement with thiamine supplementation. This case encourages the consideration of vision loss as a manifestation of WKS, especially in patients who have risk factors.

Fantastic utterances from brain-injured patients are difficult to interpret as confabulation or delusion. Starting from two clinical observations, we analyse the terms ""spontaneous confabulations"" and ""delusion"". Two brain-injured patients presented with fantastic utterances; the adhesion was complete for both patients. They also suffered from amnesic and executive disorders. Clinical interviews with neuropsychologist and psychopathologist could not distinct between spontaneaous confabulations and delusion. Neuropsychological interpretations of spontaneous confabulations are (1) the deficient strategic retrieval process arising from executive failures and (2) confusion of the temporal order of information within memory. These hypotheses cannot explain the fantastic utterances described. Are spontaneous fantastic confabulations a specific entity or did these patients present a morbid association of neurological and psychiatric disorders? Fantastic confabulations are very scarcely described and the association of neurological and psychiatric impairments enables us to better describe the clinical observations. Spontaneous confabulations reported after amnesic and executive disorders are indeed typically composed of the patient's past experiences and do not usually comprehend fantastic utterances. Neurological and psychological analyses of the fantastic utterances from two brain-injured patients do not respond to the definition of spontaneous confabulation. Fantastic confabulations are a rare entity and we propose another explanation consisting of the association of neurological and psychiatric disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Annales de readaptation et de medecine physique : revue scientifique de la Societe francaise de reeducation fonctionnelle de readaptation et de medecine physique,10.1016/j.annrmp.2008.05.005,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Netherlands,fre

The patient was administered a range of verbal tasks that required either memory recollection or other kinds of cognitive processes not involving memory.

Third, if she could not recall the episode herself correctly, she was required to choose a correct sentence about the episode (the recognition of the episode). She could not recall episodes correctly, but produced confabulation instead. She showed, however, good recognition of each episode. Furthermore, we performed recognition tests of time, person, and place about the same post-accident episodes, which were poor especially for time. In semantic memory tasks, we examined about kanji characters (ideogram) learned from the first grade to the sixth grade and mathematical knowledge learned from the second grade to the sixth grade at elementary school (""What centimeters is equal to one meter?"" or ""Tell me the formula of the size of a circle."" etc). We found that she showed a retrograde impairment for about one year. For both episodic and semantic memory, she showed an anterograde impairment. Because of the anterograde amnesia she could not acquire new facts, and also showed para-amnesia or confabulation. In a child with brain damage, neuropsychological assessment is important in predicting effect of rehabilitation and recovery of school performance.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

PL's confabulation occurred both in episodic and semantic memory tasks. In a task in which she was asked to identify photographs of people and events highly familiar to her, a temporal gradient on her performance emerged. Confabulation was massive for the recognition of photographs from the eighties and decreased consistently for the recognition of photographs representing people and events from earlier decades. Correct responses, in contrast, were distributed according to an opposite pattern. Correct recognition was very high for photographs from the fifties but consistently decreased for photographs from the following decades. These results are discussed in terms of the co-occurrence and interaction of preserved awareness of the personal past and impaired ability to access less stable memories. These results also suggest that memories are not stored randomly but according to a temporal criterion that presumably reflects the relative strength and stability of stored episodic memories.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70764-0,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

We describe a 49-year-old right-handed patient with memory disturbance following a left medial frontal subcortical hematoma. Her amnesia was characterized by (1) predominant anterograde amnesia, (2) difficulty in both voluntary recall and recognition tasks, (3) a great number of false-alarm responses in a recognition task, and (4) no confabulation. An MRI demonstrated that her lesion was restricted to the left medial frontal area and anterior cingulate gyrus. This case represents a rare instance of amnesia following damage to the frontal lobe. We speculated that the unique feature of her memory impairment resulted from combined lesions in the medial frontal subcortical white matter and anterior cingulate gyrus. It seems that Papez's circuite participated in the development of these symptoms.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

While hallucinations were visual, tactile and auditory, delusions were associated with specific neurologic defects (anosognostic phenomenon, reduplication for place, body-parts and objects and confabulation). Distractibility, inappropriate sexual behavior, agitation or seizures were lacking.

Firstly, she presented with a 2-week history of neck pain, oscillopsia, vertigo, and weakness. MRI of the brain revealed a high signal change at cervicomedullary junction. She responded to a short course of high-dose corticosteroid. One year after the first presentation, she developed bilateral optic neuritis. High dose corticosteroid therapy was prescribed for this attack After the second episode, she received long-term azathioprine. Two weeks before admission, she developed hypersomnia and confabulation. General physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed visual acuity (VA) of 20/200 in both eyes. Optic fundi were normal. MRI of the brain demonstrated hypersignal intensity lesions at the hypothalamus, tuber cinereum, medial aspect of thalami, dorsal midbrain, and occipital periventricular white matter in T2 weighted and FLAIR images. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 33 cells/mm3 (100% lymphocytes), protein of 34 mg/dL, CSF sugar of 55 mg/dL, and blood sugar of 100 mg/dL. Oligoclonal band was negative. Two weeks after admission, she developed quadriparesis, pain, and proprioceptive sensory loss below the 6th thoracic level. She also had urinary retention and constipation. MRI of the whole spinal cord showed multilevel hypersignal intensity lesions on T2 weighted and FLAIR images involving medulla, cervicomedullary junction and all segments of the spinal cord. She was diagnosed as NMO. Hypothalamic and brainstem involvement demonstrated in this patient were uncommon but rather pathognomonic for NMO.

Confabulation appeared in personal recollections and on long-term verbal memory testing. Misidentification concerned mainly his wife and house. During the four year follow-up AZ's confabulation progressively shrinked so as to become restricted to verbal memory tasks. By contrast, misidentification persisted. General semantic memory was unimpaired throughout, while performance on frontal tests was initially poor and partly improved in time. We argue that confabulation and misidentification, though often intermingled and occurring after similar lesion pattern, should be considered as different neuropsychological entities.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70809-8,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

The aim of this case report was to describe the cognitive profile of a 42 year-old man who had extensive bilateral damage to the medial temporal lobe, insular bilateral and orbitofrontal cortices due to HSVE. Severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia, naming deficits, perseverative behaviors and confabulations were observed on neuropsychological assessment.

Since her vomiting continued, she received intravenous dextrose and electrolytes without thiamine in a hospital. One month later, she developed gait disturbance, followed by confusion and dysarthria. On admission to our department, she was confusional and had ataxic dysarthria. Spontaneous and gaze evoked nystagmus was present. Limb coordination was bilaterally ataxic. Based on her clinical course and symptoms, she was diagnosed as having Wernicke's encephalopathy. From the admission day, intravenous infusion of vitamin B1 (600 mg/day) was started. A few days later, her consciousness and limb ataxia began to improve. However, truncal ataxia and polyneuropathy became evident. Eight weeks after onset, she developed Korsakoff's psychosis such as anterograde and retrograde amnesia, disorientation and confabulation. We administered large amounts of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day) in order to reduce brain edema or stabilize the impaired blood-brain barrier. Soon after, her psychosis began to improve gradually. She recovered remarkably from the psychosis, but she was left with persistent nystagmus, mild ataxic gait and polyneuropathy.
