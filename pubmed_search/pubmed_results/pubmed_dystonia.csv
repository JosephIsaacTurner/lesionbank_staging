31356289,Tremor.,"Louis, Elan D",Louis,"Tremor may be defined as an involuntary movement that is rhythmic (ie, regularly recurrent) and oscillatory (ie, rotating around a central plane) and may manifest in a variety of ways; accordingly, tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology. Consequently, the diagnosis of tremor disorders can be challenging, and misdiagnoses are common. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with straightforward approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of tremors. Focused ultrasound thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is an emerging and promising therapy for the treatment of essential tremor. The evaluation should start with a detailed tremor history followed by a focused neurologic examination, which should attend to the many subtleties of tremor phenomenology. Among other things, the history and examination are used to establish whether the primary tremor is an action tremor (ie, postural, kinetic, or intention tremor) or a resting tremor. The clinician should then formulate two sets of diagnoses: disorders in which action tremor is the predominant tremor versus those in which resting tremor is the predominant tremor. Among the most common of the former type are essential tremor, enhanced physiologic tremor, drug-induced tremor, dystonic tremor, primary writing tremor, orthostatic tremor, and cerebellar tremor. Parkinson disease is the most common disorder of resting tremor. This article details the clinical features of each of these disorders, as well as those of additional tremor disorders.",{},,"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",10.1212/CON.0000000000000748,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

Acute cholinergic crisis is one of the important causes of mortality related to OP poisoning. Delayed peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal syndromes and neuropsychiatric manifestations are the major consequences of secondary neuronal damage. This case illustrates a 14-year-old girl who ingested 50 mL of OP pesticide and developed extrapyramidal symptoms in the form of parkinsonism and hand dystonia in spite of immediate medical attention. MRI of the brain with T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences revealed bilateral symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensities. Further follow-up revealed a significant clinical improvement with marked resolutions of the brain lesions. The reversible extrapyramidal symptoms with disappearance of neuroimaging findings without neuropathy or neuropsychiatric manifestations are unusual in OP poisoning.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,BMJ case reports,10.1136/bcr-2013-009752,PMC3903097,,Journal Article; Case Reports,England,eng

Adverse effects including asterixis and myoclonus have been described in patients with chronic kidney disease, but myokymia has not been previously reported. A 69-year-old man with a history of traumatic brain injury, peripheral neuropathy, amnesia, and posttraumatic stress disorder presented to the hospital after multiple falls attributed to acute onset muscle spasms. He reported taking a total daily dose of 9600 mg of gabapentin, as prescribed. Physical examination demonstrated stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, painful muscle spasms in all extremities, and myokymia in his bilateral calves. Diffuse action tremors, as well as tongue tremors, were also observed.Initial workup, including basic laboratory investigations, brain imaging, and electroencephalogram, was unrevealing. Gabapentin toxicity was suspected, and a gabapentin holiday was initiated with the improvement of myokymia by hospital day 3. The patient was found to have a high gabapentin level (25.8 μg/mL; reference range, 2.0-20.0 μg/mL) measured the morning after hospital presentation. After restarting on a lower dose of gabapentin with multimodal pain control, the patient continued to improve with diminution of his myoclonus, tremor, and gait instability. Myokymia is a newly described motor symptom associated with gabapentin toxicity. The mechanism of gabapentin-associated myokymia is currently unknown. A brief medication holiday resulted in the resolution of motor symptoms without significant withdrawal symptoms.

27789118,Adverse Structural and Functional Effects of Marijuana on the Brain: Evidence Reviewed.,"Mandelbaum, David E; de la Monte, Suzanne M",Mandelbaum,"The growing use and legalization of cannabis are leading to increased exposures across all age groups, including in adolescence. The touting of its medicinal values stems from anecdotal reports related to treatment of a broad range of illnesses including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscle spasms, arthritis, obesity, cancer, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, post-traumatic stress, inflammatory bowel disease, and anxiety. However, anecdotal data and the high level of interest in this treatment must not obscure objective assessments of any potential and realized short- and long-term adverse effects of cannabis, particularly with respect to age of onset and chronicity of exposure. This critical review focuses on evidence-based research designed to assess both therapeutic benefits and harmful effects of cannabis exposure and is combined with an illustration of the neuropathologic findings in a fatal case of cannabis-induced psychosis. The literature and reported case provide strong evidence that chronic cannabis abuse causes cognitive impairment and damages the brain, particularly white matter, where cannabinoid 1 receptors abound. Contrary to popular perception, there are few objective data supporting preferential use of cannabis over conventional therapy for restoration of central nervous system structure and function in disease states such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, or schizophrenia. Additional research is needed to determine if subsets of individuals with various neurological and psychiatric diseases derive therapeutic benefits from cannabis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Pediatric neurology,10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2016.09.004,PMC9954727,cannabis; epilepsy; human brain; marijuana; multiple sclerosis; psychosis; treatment; white matter,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",United States,eng

In four patients, lesions were present on neuroimaging in the thalamus or brain stem (especially in the midbrain). A delayed-onset cerebellar syndrome may follow head trauma or stroke.

35940198,Case Report: Dystonic Storm Following Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection.,"Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Das, Shambaditya; Benito-León, Julián",Ghosh,"Dystonic storm (also called status dystonicus) is a neurological emergency characterized by sustained/intermittent involuntary generalized muscle contractions resulting in repetitive painful twisting movements and abnormal postures. It is commonly documented in patients with diagnosed primary dystonic syndromes or secondary dystonic states (i.e., patients with inborn errors of metabolism, dystonic cerebral palsy, Wilson's disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, and exposure to drugs). However, viral-induced dystonic storm cases have rarely been reported. We describe the case of an 11-year-old girl from rural West Bengal (India) with a dystonic storm after Japanese encephalitis. Generalized dystonic spasms lasted for about 10-20 minutes and occurred 20-30 times/day. They were associated with extreme pain, fever, exhaustion, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, pupillary dilatation, arterial hypertension, and mutism and were precipitated by a full bladder and relieved somewhat during sleep. When dystonic spasms abated, she had high-grade generalized rigidity of all four limbs and fixed cervical and truncal dystonia. She was put on invasive ventilation and deep intravenous sedation with continuous midazolam infusion and other supportive measures and had a good clinical recovery. During the 12 months of follow-up, she did not have any other episode of a dystonic storm. However, axial rigidity and intermittent appendicular (upper limb) dystonic posturing were observed.

30643669,Post-Stroke Lingual Dystonia: Clinical Description and Neuroimaging Findings.,"Pandey, Sanjay; Tater, Priyanka",Pandey,"Lingual dystonia is extremely rare following stroke. We describe clinical features and neuroimaging findings in a series of 11 patients (seven acute and four chronic) with post-stroke lingual dystonia and review the literature. This was a case series using a preformed structured proforma and review of literature using a PubMed search. In our case series, all patients had dysarthria as a presenting symptom. Seven patients had acute presentation (six had an ischemic infarct and one had thalamic hemorrhage) and four had chronic presentation (all had infarct). All patients except one had small infarcts, with the majority of them in the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter regions. Additional chronic ischemic lesions were seen in all patients with acute presentation. The majority of the patients with acute (five out of seven; 71.42%) presentation had left-sided involvement on imaging. We could identify only one case of acute post-stroke lingual dystonia following the PubMed search. Three other cases of post-stroke lingual dystonia with chronic presentation have been described; however, these were associated with oromandibular or cranial dystonia. Our results, based on brain lesions, suggest that all lingual dystonia patients with acute infarcts had underlying chronic infarcts. Overall, more left-sided than right-sided strokes were observed with post-stroke lingual movement disorders including dystonia; however, the data were not significant (p = 1). All patients had dysarthria, with only one having mild tongue weakness and only four having facial weakness. This suggests that the lingual dystonia was responsible for the dysarthria rather than weakness in these patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,"Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements (New York, N.Y.)",10.7916/D8RB8NJC,PMC6329777,Dystonia; magnetic resonance images; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
35822248,A case of Lewy body disease and anaplastic astrocytoma presenting with atypical parkinsonism.,"Leahy, Christopher B; Robinson, Andrew C; Jabbari, Edwin; Morris, Huw R; Lally, Imogen; Djoukhadar, Ibrahim; Roncaroli, Federico; Kobylecki, Christopher",Leahy,"We report on a patient with atypical parkinsonism due to coexistent Lewy body disease (LBD) and diffuse anaplastic astrocytoma. The patient presented with a mixed cerebellar and parkinsonian syndrome, incomplete levodopa response, and autonomic failure. The clinical diagnosis was multiple system atrophy (MSA). Supportive features of MSA according to the consensus diagnostic criteria included postural instability and early falls, early dysphagia, pyramidal signs, and orofacial dystonia. Multiple exclusion criteria for a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) were present. Neuropathological examination of the left hemisphere and the whole midbrain and brainstem revealed LBD, neocortical-type consistent with iPD, hippocampal sclerosis, and widespread neoplastic infiltration by an anaplastic astrocytoma without evidence of a space occupying lesion. There were no pathological features of MSA. The classification of atypical parkinsonism was difficult in this patient. The clinical features and disease course were confounded by the coexistent tumor, leading to atypical presentation and a diagnosis of MSA. We suggest that the initial features were due to Lewy body pathology, while progression and ataxia, pyramidal signs, and falls were accelerated by the occurrence of the astrocytoma. Our case reflects the challenges of an accurate diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism, the potential for confounding co-pathology and the need for autopsy examination to reach a definitive diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/neup.12848,PMC10084019,Lewy body disease; anaplastic astrocytoma; atypical parkinsonism; multiple system atrophy; neuropathology,Case Reports,Australia,eng

Antecedent clinical insult could rarely unmask latent neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an autopsy-proven case of corticobasal degeneration which was preceded by a lacunar infarction. A 58-year-old man presented with acute ataxia associated with a lacunar infarction in the right paramedian pons. His ataxia persisted with additional progressive gait difficulty and left arm clumsiness. Six months later, a follow-up neurological examination showed asymmetrical bradykinesia, apraxia, dystonic posturing, postural instability, and mild ataxia of the left limbs. Cognitive examination revealed frontal executive dysfunction and visuospatial difficulties. Dopamine transporter imaging scan demonstrated bilateral reduced uptakes in mid-to-posterior putamen, more prominent on the right side. Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, asymmetric limb dystonia, and ideomotor apraxia became more conspicuous, while limb ataxia gradually vanished. The patient became unable to walk without assistance after 1 year, and died 4 years after the symptom onset. Autopsy findings showed frontoparietal cortical atrophy, ballooned neurons, and phosphorylated tau-positive astrocytic plaques and neuropil threads with gliosis and neuronal loss, confirming the corticobasal degeneration.

27173653,The anatomical basis of upper limb dystonia: lesson from secondary cases.,"Liuzzi, Daniele; Gigante, Angelo Fabio; Leo, Antonio; Defazio, Giovanni",Liuzzi,"Upper limb dystonia is a focal dystonia that may affect muscles in the arm, forearm and hand. The neuroanatomical substrates involved in upper limb dystonia are not fully understood. Traditionally, dysfunction of the basal ganglia is presumed to be the main cause of dystonia but a growing body of evidence suggests that a network of additional cortical and subcortical structures may be involved. To identify the brain regions that are affected in secondary upper limb dystonia may help to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of the condition. We considered only patients with focal upper limb dystonia associated with a single localized brain lesion. To identify these patients, we conducted a systematic review of the published literature as well as the medical records of 350 patients with adult-onset dystonia seen over past 15 years at our movement disorder clinic. The literature review revealed 36 articles describing 72 cases of focal upper limb dystonia associated with focal lesions. Among patients at our clinic, four had focal lesions on imaging studies. Lesions were found in multiple regions including thalamus (n = 39), basal ganglia (n = 17), cortex (n = 4), brainstem (n = 4), cerebellum (n = 1), and cervical spine (n = 7). Dystonic tremor was not associated with any particular site of lesion, whereas there was a trend for an inverse association between task specificity and thalamic involvement. These data in combination with functional imaging studies of idiopathic upper limb dystonia support a model in which a network of different regions plays a role in pathogenesis.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-016-2598-6,,Brain damage; Task specificity; Tremor; Upper limb dystonia,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review; Systematic Review,Italy,eng

This report describes dystonia confined to the LE only during forward walking. This case required careful neurological and diagnostic assessment because the patient was taking several neuropsychiatric drugs that cause symptomatic dystonia, such as aripiprazole (ARP). A 53-year-old man visited our university hospital with a complaint of abnormalities in the LE that appeared only during walking. Neurological examinations other than walking were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed meningioma in the right sphenoid ridge. The patient had been treated for depression with neuropsychiatric medications for a long time, and his abnormal gait appeared about 2 years after additional administration of ARP. After the meningioma was removed, his symptoms remained. Surface electromyography showed dystonia in both LE during forward walking, although his abnormal gait appeared to be accompanied by spasticity. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with tardive dystonia (TD). Although dystonia did not disappear clinically, it was alleviated after discontinuing ARP. Administration of trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride and concomitant rehabilitation improved his dystonia until return to work, but some residual gait abnormalities remained. We report an unusual case of TD with task specificity confined to the LE. The TD was induced by the administration of ARP in combination with multiple psychotropic medications.

1435659,The postconcussion syndrome and the sequelae of mild head injury.,"Evans, R W",Evans,"The postconcussion syndrome refers to a large number of symptoms and signs that may occur alone or in combination following usually mild head injury. The most common complaints are headaches, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, loss of consciousness and memory, and noise sensitivity. Mild head injury is a major public health concern because the annual incidence is about 150 per 100,000 population, accounting for 75% or more of all head injuries. The postconcussion syndrome has been recognized for at least the last few hundred years and has been the subject of intense controversy for more than 100 years. The Hollywood head injury myth has been an important contributor to persisting skepticism and might be countered by educational efforts and counter-examples from boxing. The organicity of the postconcussion syndrome has now become well documented. Abnormalities following mild head injury have been reported in neuropathologic, neurophysiologic, neuroimaging, and neuropsychologic studies. There are multiple sequelae of mild head injury, including headaches of multiple types, cranial nerve symptoms and signs, psychologic and somatic complaints, and cognitive impairment. Rare sequelae include hematomas, seizures, transient global amnesia, tremor, and dystonia. Neuroimaging and physiologic and psychologic testing should be used judiciously based on the problems of the particular patient rather than in a cookbook fashion. Prognostic studies clearly substantiate the existence of a postconcussion syndrome. Manifestations of the postconcussion syndrome are common, with resolution in most patients by 3 to 6 months after the injury. Persistent symptoms and cognitive deficits are present in a distinct minority of patients for additional months or years. Risk factors for persisting sequelae include age over 40 years; lower educational, intellectual, and socioeconomic level; female gender; alcohol abuse; prior head injury; and multiple trauma. Although a small minority are malingerers, frauds, or have compensation neurosis, most patients have genuine complaints. Contrary to a popular perception, most patients with litigation or compensation claims are not cured by a verdict. Treatment is individualized depending on the specific complaints of the patient. Although a variety of medication and psychologic treatments are currently available, ongoing basic and clinical research of all aspects of mild head injury are crucial to provide more efficacious treatment in the future.",{},,Neurologic clinics,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng
36701735,Monochorea after acute contralateral pontine infarction: A case report.,"Hwang, Yun Su; Shin, Byoung-Soo; Ryu, Han Uk; Kang, Hyun Goo",Hwang,"Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement characterized by random, brief, and involuntary muscle contractions. In stroke, a common cause of chorea, basal ganglia are anatomical locations that can cause chorea when a stroke occurs, and chorea is less frequently triggered by a stroke in other anatomical brain regions. Herein, we report a rare case of monochorea after acute contralateral pontine infarction. A 32-year-old man visited the emergency room due to dysarthria and right hemiparesis that occurred approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes before the visit. A brain magnetic resonance image confirmed a diffusion restriction lesion in the left pons. The patient was initially diagnosed with acute infarction at the left pons and began to receive medical treatment with an antiplatelet agent and statin with admission. Approximately 14 hours after the onset of the initial stroke symptoms, the patient complained of involuntary movement in the right arm for the first time. Intermittent, irregular involuntary movements were observed in the distal part of the right arm. This symptom was unpredictable and random, and a similar symptom was not observed in other parts of the patient's body. Clinically, post-stroke monochorea was suspected. The symptom improved from day 5 without specific medical treatment for chorea. The monochorea caused by the pontine lesion in this case was triggered by the direct lesions of the corticospinal tract, and its underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. However, abnormal movements can occur due to inadequate downstream activation or inhibition of the corticospinal tract, which is induced by functional abnormalities of the motor cortex. This case suggests that further investigation is needed on the mechanisms of direct corticospinal tract lesions for chorea.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000032660,PMC9857559,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Patients rarely have paroxysmal dystonia (or tonic spasm), which can be the presenting manifestation of the disease. Two videotaped observations are presented. The first patient was a 27-year-old woman, treated for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, who presented daily several short (<1minute) paroxysms of right hemibody dystonia. Brain MRI revealed several areas of cerebral demyelination, including the posterior limb of the left internal capsule with gadolinium enhancement. These events disappeared 7 days after corticosteroid infusion. The second patient was a 62-year-old man who presented brief episodes (<1minute) of daily painful left hemibody dystonia. Three months later, similar paroxysms affecting the right hemibody including the face occurred. At times, the two hemibodies were affected simultaneously. The brain MRI showed multiple areas of white matter hyperintensity, including two symmetrical areas in the posterior limb of the internal capsules. Multiple sclerosis was diagnosed on clinical, MRI and biological data. Four days after starting corticosteroids, these paroxysmal phenomena disappeared totally. Dystonia is an under-recognized aspect of paroxysmal events during multiple sclerosis. It might involve ephaptic transmission among abnormal demyelinated neurons; this ectopic excitation can arise at variable levels of the corticospinal tract, but the analysis of reported cases and those described in this study shows that impairment of the posterior limb of the internal capsule seems to be a prevalent topography. Inflammation is likely to play a role because steroids often improve these phenomena.

In this case study, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate a fully conscious, ex-coma patient who suffered from neurological difficulties for a few years due to traumatic brain injury. For a few years after injury, the patient was under medication with zolpidem that drastically improved his symptoms. MEG recordings taken before and after zolpidem showed a reduction in power in the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) and lower beta (15-20 Hz) frequency bands. An increase in power after zolpidem intake was found in the higher beta/lower gamma (20-43 Hz) frequency band. Source level functional connectivity measured using weighted-phase lag index showed changes after zolpidem intake. Stronger connectivity between left frontal and temporal brain regions was observed. We report that zolpidem induces a change in MEG resting power and functional connectivity in the patient.

12518301,Secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the central nervous system.,"LeDoux, Mark S; Brady, Kimberly A",LeDoux,"We tested the hypothesis that structural lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) associated with cervical dystonia more commonly involve the cerebellum and its primary afferent pathways than basal ganglia structures. Cervical dystonia is the most common focal dystonia, the majority of cases are idiopathic, and only a small percentage of patients have a family history of dystonia or other movement disorders. Pathophysiological mechanisms operative in solely or predominantly appendicular dystonias such as writer's cramp and Oppenheim's dystonia, respectively, may not be directly applicable to axial dystonias. The localization of structural lesions of the CNS associated with secondary cervical dystonia may provide some insight into the neural structures potentially involved in primary cervical dystonia. The National Library of Medicine Gateway (from 1960) and a clinical database maintained by the senior author (from 1999) were searched for cases of secondary cervical dystonia associated with structural lesions of the CNS. Search terms included one or more of the following: dystonia, torticollis, cervical, secondary, and symptomatic. Lesion localization and type, patient age, patient gender, head position, occurrence of sensory tricks, and associated neurological findings were tabulated for each case. Structural lesions associated with cervical dystonia were most commonly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum. The remaining cases were equally divided between the cervical spinal cord and basal ganglia. Although inconsistent, head rotation tended to be contralateral to lesion localization. Additional neurological abnormalities were present in the majority of patients with secondary cervical dystonia. The relative paucity of basal ganglia pathology and concentration of lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord in patients with secondary cervical dystonia suggests that dysfunction of cerebellar afferent pathways may be important to the pathophysiology of primary cervical dystonia.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.10301,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review",United States,eng

A 73-year-old Japanese woman presented with acute pyrexia, agitation, and disturbance of consciousness. She gradually developed a reduction in speech frequency and truncal dystonia causing abnormal posture. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated high-intensity lesions in the bilateral frontal lobes, and her cerebrospinal fluid revealed mild pleocytosis. She was diagnosed with acute encephalitis and treated with acyclovir and intravenous dexamethasone; however, no improvement was observed. She was transferred to our hospital 6 weeks after the onset of her symptoms, and anti-NMDAR antibodies were identified in her cerebrospinal fluid through indirect immunolabeling with rat brain frozen sections and cell-based assays with NR1/NR2 transfected HEK cells. Follow-up MRI showed enlargement of the lesions in the right frontal lobe with gadolinium enhancement, suggesting a brain tumor. Stereotactic surgery was implemented, with subsequent pathological examination revealing that the tumor was consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) without evidence of systemic satellite lesions. Stereotactic irradiative therapies were then added to her treatment regimen, which partly improved her neurological symptoms with only mild cognitive dysfunction still remaining. A decrease in anti-NMDAR antibody titer was also confirmed after immunotherapy and tumor removal. We herein report our experience with a novel case of PCNS-DLBCL masquerading as anti-NMDAR encephalitis that satisfied the diagnostic criteria of ""proNMDARE.""

Although dystonia can occur as a symptom of moyamoya disease, few studies have reported truncal dystonia occurring with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis. Here, we report a case of truncal dystonia with MCA occlusion. The patient was a 48-year-old female clerical worker who lived alone. An abnormal cervical posture initially appeared 7 years before (right flexion). Symptoms improved with medication and botulinum toxin injection. Five years before this report, her symptoms worsened, so the dose of oral medication was increased and botulinum treatment was performed, but the symptoms did not improve. The patient showed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cortical areas but not in the basal ganglia. We performed superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass surgery because we believed that the dystonia was due to right MCA stenosis. The patient's symptoms improved immediately after surgery, except for her mild cervical backbend. Seven months after the surgery, the patient's involuntary movements showed further improvement, and symptoms have not worsened even after 2 years.

The presence of schizophrenia needs to be distinguished from that of autoimmune encephalitis. Herein, we describe the case of a woman who exhibited abnormal mental behavior and cognitive impairment. The patient had experienced similar symptoms more than 20 years previously and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patient's psychotic symptoms improved after treatment with antipsychotic drugs; however, cognitive impairment persisted. She was diagnosed with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor concurrent with anti-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor encephalitis. She showed improvement after treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIgs). Furthermore, we reviewed the literature and found that, including the present case, 10 patients have been diagnosed with anti-NMDA concurrent with anti-AMPA-receptor encephalitis. Three of these patients were men and seven were women, and their ages ranged from 21 to 71 years. Moreover, seven (70%) patients had a history of tumors. Symptoms of these patients included psychotic symptoms, varying degrees of consciousness disturbance, seizures, dyskinesia, dystonia, autonomic dysfunction, agitation, and verbal reduction. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings showed scattered fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in subcortical white matter and/or medial temporal lobe in seven (70%) patients. After combination treatment, including tumor removal and administration of steroids, IVIg, plasma exchange, or immunity inhibitors, the symptoms improved in part of the patients. It is necessary to exclude autoimmune encephalitis for patients with psychiatric manifestations and cognitive impairment. Timely combination therapy is important in anti-NMDA-receptor concurrent with anti-AMPA-receptor encephalitis.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Frontiers in psychiatry,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.827138,PMC8882583,anti-AMPAR encephalitis; anti-NMDAR encephalitis; autoimmune encephalitis; psychotic; schizophrenia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Pain, swelling, stiffness, and hypoesthesia are observed as manifestations. The presence of a trophic ulcer is accompanied by a range of severe manifestations. The assaults occur in three distinct phases, namely vasospastic, plethoric, and erythema. Various approaches improve the overall well-being of a patient. It is possible to differentiate between primary and secondary Raynaud's syndrome, the latter being linked to systemic diseases. The application of botulin toxin is commonly indicated in several medical conditions including focal dystonia, spasticity with or without contractures, paraparesis in children with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, brain injuries, involuntary muscle hyperactivity of a non-dystonic nature, pain management, strabismus, nystagmus, sialorrhea, and esthetic medicine. When treating Raynaud's a technique is used with injection at the base of each finger, from the palmar side, which helps with cooling and minimizing discomfort for patients. We present a clinical case of a 70-year-old female patient with Raynaud's syndrome in which we have placed 70E distributed to both hands botulin toxin type A. Improvement in the patient's symptomatology was noticed on day 3, with warming of the hands, lack of swelling, and pain with duration of the effect little over three months.

A 27-year-old female was admitted with fever, headache, altered sensorium, and convulsions. She tested positive for Japanese B encephalitis-IgM. Following conservative management, she regained consciousness after 5 days when neurological examination revealed marked cognitive impairment, medial convergence of eyeballs, upward gaze restriction, upper limbs dystonia with brisk tendon jerks, and flaccid paraparesis. A repeat neurological examination, on day 15 of admission, showed marked wasting and intermittent fasciculation in both lower limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical (right > left) bilateral thalamic and midbrain lesions, hyperintense on T2 and T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted imaging with mild diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map, suggestive of encephalitis. Nerve conduction study revealed decreased compound muscle action potentials exclusively in lower limbs with intact sensory nerve action potentials. Electromyogram showed chronic denervation potentials and presence of spontaneous activity in lower limbs, but not in upper limbs, indicative of focal anterior horn cell involvement. Prognosis of Japanese B encephalitis does not only depend on cerebral sequelae.

Here, we describe 2 patients with refractory focal epilepsy and contralateral focal limb dystonia whose seizures and dystonic symptoms simultaneously resolved after anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy. We identified 2 patients within the Mount Sinai Health system with improvement in dystonia after medial temporal lobectomy. Retrospective chart reviews for the clinical history were performed. Patient 1 suffered a traumatic injury of the right temporal lobe, developing left hemidystonia and epilepsy. He received a right amygdala-hippocampectomy, which resolved both. Patient 2 has a history of right temporal glioma resection complicated by an infarct, resulting in left hemidystonia and epilepsy. He received a right medial temporal resection, which nearly resolved both. Our cases demonstrate a medial temporal-basal ganglia network dysfunction in dystonia-epilepsy that was modulated and cured by resective surgery. We hypothesize that the mechanisms behind these observed phenomena were due to a pathologic connectivity of the basal ganglia and amygdala-hippocampus.

The clinical features of glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody-positive PERM may be overlooked, particularly with some unusual symptoms. A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of tension headache for 20 days and mild dysarthria. These symptoms were followed by panic, profuse sweating, severe dysarthria, dizziness, unsteady gait, and paroxysmal muscle spasms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. The patient's condition steadily deteriorated. He repeatedly presented with rigidity, panic attacks, severe anxiety, paroxysmal inspiratory laryngeal stridor, cyanosis of the lips, and intractable epilepsy. Electromyography showed multiple myoclonic seizures, a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and a single generalized tonic seizure. Screening for autoimmune encephalitis antibodies revealed anti-GlyR antibodies in his cerebrospinal fluid. Immunomodulatory pulse therapy with steroids and immunoglobulin resulted in expeditious improvement of the symptoms within 2 weeks, and a follow-up at 5 weeks showed consistent clinical improvement. Our case highlights that inspiratory laryngeal stridor is an important symptom of PERM.

However, in some cases, pneumocephalus presents with headache, encephalopathy, or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. Here, we present a case of iatrogenic tension pneumocephalus following endoscopic sinus surgery, presenting as abnormal involuntary movements resembling a movement disorder with choreiform movements. A 67-year-old previously healthy male presented with new onset chorea and dystonia associated with headache, encephalopathy, and postural instability 4 days after undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps. Computed tomography showed prominent intraventricular pneumocephalus causing enlargement of the anterior horns of both lateral ventricles with lateral displacement of the basal ganglia nuclei and a bony defect in the skull base. Neurosurgical correction of the cranial defect provided complete symptomatic resolution. Pneumocephalus as a result of an iatrogenic injury of the skull base manifesting as an acute movement disorder is a rare complication of a nasal sinus procedure. We speculate that compression of the caudate nucleus and striatum resulted in decreased pallidothalamic inhibition and thalamocortical disinhibition leading to the development of a hyperkinetic movement disorder. This unusual presentation of a common procedure illustrates a neurological emergency that requires prompt recognition and timely correction.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Surgical neurology international,10.4103/sni.sni_190_18,PMC6169345,All movement disorders; clinical neurological examination; dystonia,Case Reports,United States,eng

The most frequent side effects are ataxia, gait disturbance, paresthesias, dysgeusia, and hemiparesis. Here, we report the first case of thalamic hand dystonia rapidly occurring after MRgFUS thalamotomy of the ventral intermediate nucleus (V.im). MRgFUS thalamotomy was performed in a 60-year-old left-handed patient for his disabling medically refractory essential tremor. The intervention resulted in a marked reduction of his action tremor. However, the patient developed an unvoluntary abnormal posture in his left hand a few days after the procedure with difficulty holding a cigarette between his fingers. Brain MRI revealed the expected MRgFUS lesion within the right V.im as well as an extension of the lesion anteriorly to the V.im in the ventro-oralis nucleus. Tractography showed that the lesion disrupted the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract as expected with a lesion suppressing tremor. However, the lesion also was interrupted fibers connecting to the superior frontal and pre-central cortices (primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and supplementary area). We hypothesized that the interventional MRgFUS thalamotomy was slightly off target, which induced a dysfunction within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical network and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway reaching a sufficient threshold of basal ganglia/cerebellum circuitry interference to induce dystonia. This rare side effect emphasizes the risk of imbalance within the dystonia network (i.e., basal ganglia-cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit) secondary to V.im thalamotomy.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000538931,,Dystonia; Essential tremor; MRI-guided high intensity focused ultrasound; Side effect; Thalamotomy,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

31447480,Syncope and Twitching at the Emergency Department.,"Scutelnic, Adrian; Prange, Ulrike; Jung, Simon; Heldner, Mirjam R",Scutelnic,"BACKGROUND Anti-LGI1 encephalitis is a type of autoimmune limbic encephalitis. This case report elucidates features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis, focusing on clinical findings and outcome as well as on rarely reported sinus arrest and its pathophysiology. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old female patient presented at the Emergency Department (ED) because of twitching and an acute confusional state. Initial neurological examination revealed cognitive disturbance with disorientation, inattention, and amnestic deficits. While in the ED, twitching of the right arm was observed and shortly thereafter she experienced a sinus arrest. A temporary cardiac pacemaker was implanted. Laboratory investigations demonstrated mild hyponatremia and positive LGI1-IgG antibodies in serum. An initial head MRI was unremarkable and electroencephalography showed epileptic seizure activity starting focally in the left hemisphere synchronous with the intermittent twitching of the right arm. A seizure-suppressant therapy with levetiracetam, valproate, and gabapentin was initiated, as well as an immunosuppressive pulse therapy with methylprednisolone followed by a tapering oral regimen of prednisolone. Within a few days, the seizures ceased. One month later, neurocognitive test results were back to normal. At 2 years, mild depressive symptoms and anxiety disorder were the main clinical problems, as well as episodic migraine-like headaches. CONCLUSIONS Repetitive focal dystonic seizures, confusion, amnestic deficits, sinus arrest, and mild-to-moderate hyponatremia are pathognomonic features of anti-LGI1 limbic encephalitis. Sinus arrest may occur because of a direct pathophysiological dysfunction of the structures involved in autonomic cardiac rhythm control or as an ictal or postictal phenomenon. Early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are both of utmost importance for favorable clinical outcome.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.916945,PMC6730258,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We provide bibliographic evidence to support metronidazole toxicity and potential Crohn disease-associated neurologic involvement. The patient presented dystonia, cerebellar ataxia, and altered mental status. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed typical findings of metronidazole toxicity and white matter involvement of the centrum semiovale. Immunoelectrophoresis and immunofixation of serum and cerebrospinal fluid proteins were consistent with a systemic inflammatory process. We concluded on an association between drug toxicity and probable Crohn-associated neurologic involvement. Metronidazole was stopped and the patient was placed on vitamin therapy and diazepam to control dystonia. She deteriorated and was transferred to the intensive care unit where she expired.

These intracranial lesions are more commonly observed in immunocompromised individuals, often as part of disseminated miliary TB or after latent infection reactivation. This case report presents the occurrence of a thalamic tuberculoma in an immunocompetent girl. An 11-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of progressive right-sided ataxic hemiparesis, hand dystonia/thalamic hand, and headache. There was only a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (25 mm/h.), and her remaining biochemistry and vitals were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed an ill-defined intra-axial heterogeneous lobulated lesion with crenated margins involving the thalamus and the posterior limb of the internal capsule with significant vasogenic edema. Given the clinical picture, the working diagnosis was a high-grade brain tumor. Due to the absence of a viable operative corridor for a meaningful resection and the diagnostic uncertainty, a stereotactic biopsy was performed, and histopathological analysis confirmed the presence of granulomas consistent with TB. A human immunodeficiency virus test (negative) and interferon-gamma release assay (positive) were then obtained. The patient was commenced on a regimen of anti-TB drugs with a tapering steroid dose. At 8 months, her most recent MRI showed a significant reduction in the size of her tuberculoma, and there is a complete resolution of her hand dystonia and hemiparesis to allow for independence in her activities of daily living. This report emphasizes the importance of considering causes other than degenerative, vascular, or neoplasms in patients with hemiparesis with dystonia. CNS tuberculomas can present as such without prior history or specific clinical symptoms of TB, making them a diagnostic challenge. In cases with such uncertainty regarding the nature of an intracranial lesion and the role of resection, a stereotactic biopsy is invaluable.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Surgical neurology international,10.25259/SNI_581_2023,PMC10559370,Ataxic hemiparesis; Immune competent; Intracranial tuberculoma; Lacunary syndrome; Thalamic hand; Thalamus,Case Reports,United States,eng

We report on a 79 year old woman with an unremarkable past medical history who progressively developed psychomotor agitation and insomnia through a period of four months, followed by an acute onset complex hyperkinetic syndrome with chorea, focal left foot dystonia, oral dyskinesias and severe speech impairment. Brain MRI showed multiple subcortical lesions without basal ganglia involvement, and a large cortical lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe that appeared to be ischemic. These findings along with a strongly elevated titer of anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2) glycoprotein-I antibodies and positive Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC) suggested a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Syndrome, confirmed 14 weeks later as a Primary syndrome.

Brain MRI showed bilateral hyperintensity in the basal ganglia and in the cerebellar hemispheres. The clinical evolution and the MRI abnormalities are similar to those described in cases of poisoning by CO where the mechanism of brain injury is related to histotoxic hypoxia. We believe that LPG, considered until now a mixture of gas with low neurotoxic power, may have caused direct toxic damage to the brain, mediated by a mechanism of hypoxia, such as in CO intoxication.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,10.2147/NDT.S80460,PMC4427602,Parkinsonism; ataxia; dystonia; liquefied petroleum gas,Case Reports,New Zealand,eng

CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain.

A 20-year-old, female, left-handed table tennis player complained of difficulty hitting a ping-pong ball. She started playing table tennis at 8 years of age, practiced for more than 4 hours every day, and participated in national tournaments. Abnormal flexion of the left wrist when hitting a ball became apparent when she was 19 years old. The abnormal movement emerged on the forehand stroke and, subsequently, on the backhand, until finally she could not continue playing. The diagnosis was task-specific focal dystonia that did not recover with medication. She visited our hospital and underwent right Vo thalamotomy. The surgery was performed using local anesthesia, with the patient swinging a paddle during stimulation and coagulation of the thalamus. Her symptoms had improved completely the day after surgery, such that she was able to participate in tournaments again.

These cases highlight the need for reduced initial dose, slow titration, and close monitoring when initiating baclofen treatment in children with AKI.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Child neurology open,10.1177/2329048X20937113,PMC7315666,baclofen; children; dystonia; kidney injury; rehabilitation; spasticity; traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng
9159745,Cervical dystonia associated with tumors of the posterior fossa.,"Krauss, J K; Seeger, W; Jankovic, J",Krauss,"Cervical dystonia was associated with posterior fossa tumors in three patients. The onset of dystonia paralleled the appearance of other focal neurologic signs. All patients had extraaxial tumors located in the cerebellopontine angle that were removed via suboccipital approaches. The tumors were identified as schwannomas arising from the glossopharyngeal nerve and from the vagus/accessory nerves; and a meningioma. Postoperatively, the cervical dystonia improved markedly during a period of 8 years in one patient, and it remitted completely within 1 year in another patient. In the third patient, cervical dystonia persisted. The combination of the clinical findings and the temporal relationship of their appearance suggest a causal association between the posterior fossa tumors and cervical dystonia in three cases.

Contralateral C7 nerve transfer has been shown to improve function and reduce spasticity in the affected upper limb with post-stroke hemiplegia. However, reports about the efficacy of this procedure in treating upper limb spasticity caused by hemiplegic cerebral palsy were limited. We reported two cases (a 23-year-old male and a 18-year-old female) who suffered from hemiplegic cerebral palsy with unilateral sustained upper limb spasticity and underwent contralateral C7 nerve transfer in adulthood. The scores of Fugel-Meyer and ROM of the affected upper limbs were observed before and after surgery. Compared with the preoperative, scores of the latest follow-up both were significantly improved. The muscle tension of the upper limbs decreased, and the symptoms of spasm were alleviated. Considering contralateral C7 nerve transfer could effectively relieve spasticity and improve upper limb activity, it can be recommended as one of the reliable methods to manage spasticity and dystonia of upper limbs in patients with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,British journal of neurosurgery,10.1080/02688697.2020.1859091,,CC7 nerve transfer; cerebral palsy; prespinal route; spastic paralysis,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This study aimed to summarize the clinical features to enhance our understanding of anti-GlyR antibody-related disease. By collecting clinical information from admitted patients positive for glycine receptor (GlyR) antibody, the clinical characteristics of a new patient positive for GlyR antibody were reported in this study. To obtain additional information regarding anti-GlyR antibody-linked illness, clinical data and findings on both newly reported instances in this study and previously published cases were merged and analyzed. A new case of anti-GlyR antibody-related progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) was identified in this study. A 20-year-old man with only positive cerebrospinal fluid anti-GlyR antibody had a good prognosis with first-line immunotherapy. The literature review indicated that the common clinical manifestations of anti-GlyR antibody-related disease included PERM or stiff-person syndrome (SPS) (n = 179, 50.1%), epileptic seizure (n = 94, 26.3%), and other neurological disorders (n = 84, 24.5%). Other neurological issues included demyelination, inflammation, cerebellar ataxia and movement disorders, encephalitis, acute psychosis, cognitive impairment or dementia, celiac disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain and allodynia, steroid-responsive deafness, hemiballism/tics, laryngeal dystonia, and generalized weakness included respiratory muscles. The group of PERM/SPS exhibited a better response to immunotherapy than others. The findings suggest the presence of multiple clinical phenotypes in anti-GlyR antibody-related disease. Common clinical phenotypes include PERM, SPS, epileptic seizure, and paraneoplastic disease.

All cases showed, on computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging, focal lesions involving the posterolateral quadrant of the thalamus. Review of similar cases reported with identical clinico-radiologic features allows us to conclude that it is possible to establish an accurate anatomoclinical correlation based on the clinical phenomenology, even before imaging studies are performed, in these cases.

Antibodies against NMDA receptors were detected in the sera and cerebrospinal fluids. Immune-mediated treatments were administered. Three months later, the dystonic seizures disappeared. We diagnosed her with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. SPECT suggested that the main region of encephalitis was the basal ganglia.

Here we present a report of successful treatment of pyogenic atlantoaxial rotational dislocation representing adult torticollis with VA occlusion. A 67-year-old woman with neck pain and high fever was treated for suspected meningitis. Although her fever improved, pain persisted for several weeks. Examinations mostly showed characteristics of an infection with destructive atlantoaxial rotational dislocation; however, positive uptake with positron emission tomography, no anomalies with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and VA occlusion indicated the presence of a tumor lesion. After VA embolization and Halo reduction/stabilization, biopsy and blood culture revealed pyogenic infection. Antibiotics with rigid stabilization improved the inflammation and allowed definitive occipitocervical fixation, resulting in an uneventful postoperative course and painless bony fusion 2 years postoperatively. VA involvement should be examined for safe treatment. Stabilization is warranted to improve chronic inflammation.

She was well until 9 months prior to the present admission to our hospital, when she had an acute onset of left hemiparesis which turned out to have been caused by a thalamic infarct. Her hemiparesis showed nearly complete recovery during the next four months. She noted an onset of severe spontaneous pain and difficulty in using her left hand four months prior to the present admission. Neurologic examination on admission revealed an alert and well oriented Japanese woman. Cranial nerves were intact. Although she did not have weakness, her left hand showed thalamic posture, and upon standing, she showed a dystonic posture in which her left forearm took pronation and flexion at the elbow joint and her left lower extremity took extension in the knee joint and planter flexion in the ankle joint. Her dystonic posture increased during walking and disappeared in the supine position. She complained of severe spontaneous pain and tingling sensation in her left extremities. Position sense was diminished in her left leg. However other sensations were intact. She had slight ataxia on the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric, but the planter response was extensor on the left side. MRI revealed a small lacunar infarct involving the right posterolateral thalamic region. EMG with surface electrodes revealed non-reciprocal tonic discharges in the left biceps brachii and forearm flexor and extensor muscles. She responded poorly to various medications. Only trihexyphenidyl showed partial alleviation of her pain and dystonic posture. We thought her pain might be caused by dystonic contraction of the skeletal muscles, at least in part. We injected 25 IU of botulinus toxin as a total dose into her biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and wrist flexor muscles. A few days after the injection, her dystonic posture began to show marked improvement; as her dystonia improved, her pain also showed marked improvement. This patient appeared to represent a case of post-hemiplegic dystonia. Her pain was initially thought to be the thalamic pain. However, as her pain disappeared with improvement of her dystonia, her pain is most likely to have been caused by the dystonic muscle contraction.

A 27-year-old woman complaining of headache and left motor weakness was found to have a thalamic tumor on the right side. The lesion was totally removed using transventricular approach. Histopathologically, tumor samples manifested features of anaplastic astrocytoma. She underwent stereotactic radiosurgery in addition to the conventional radiation and chemotherapy. Afterward, she returned to her usual life without any neurological deficits. Sixteen months postoperatively, the patient developed forced head tilting to the left side combined with chin lift. On the TWSTRS, she registered 15 for torticollis severity. The abnormal head posturing was alleviated by the sensory trick of touching her face with her right hand. Irregular-shaped lesion involving the thalamus, lenticular nuclei, midbrain, pons, and cerebellum was presented on magnetic resonance images. Steroid therapy effectively diminished the lesion size, and her abnormal head posturing was gradually ameliorated (TWSTRS severity scale = 3).

It strikes previously healthy school-aged children and is usually cryptogenic. Its dramatic onset with refractory status epilepticus is always preceded by a nonspecific febrile illness. The seizure activity in FIRES may last for several weeks with little to no response to antiepileptic treatment, usually resulting in the usage of anaesthetics. This acute phase is followed by a chronic, refractory epilepsy and cognitive deficit, that persist for the rest of the patient's life. Still to this day no definite cause has been described. In this study we review the current finding in FIRES and describe a case of a 4-year-old patient with a dramatic course of the acute phase in FIRES and unusual presentation of the chronic phase, which is dominated by extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia.

It is manifested by systemic high blood pressure, hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, intermittent agitation, and certain forms of dystonia. A semi-comatose 46-year-old man was transferred from the regional rehabilitation hospital with various complaints involving fluctuating vital signs, including uncontrolled hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and dystonia in all extremities. The patient underwent brain surgery for astrocytoma in 1996. The patient also had a history of first ischemic stroke on the basal ganglia in 2008 and a second one in the same area in 2017. The laboratory, electrocardiography, and radiologic findings were normal. Brain imaging indicated an old infarction on the basal ganglia with hydrocephalus. Tractography using diffusion tensor imaging showed discontinuity of multiple tracts, and electrophysiologic tests, such as evoked potentials, displayed an absent response. Based on the dysautonomic symptoms and brain evaluations, the physiatrist diagnosed the patient with PAID. Bromocriptine, propranolol, and clonazepam were administered sequentially, but autonomic instability persisted. Then, intravenous opioid was administered, and fluctuations in body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, as well as decerebrate-type dystonia were improved. However, simultaneously, drug-induced severe hypotension developed (systolic blood pressure, 57 mm Hg). Subsequently, a transdermal opioid (fentanyl) patch for PAID was applied once every 3 days. Ultimately, all vital signs and dystonia were managed without further complications, and the patient was discharged. A patient diagnosed with PAID following multiple cerebral insults was observed, whose condition was controlled by application of opioid patch rather than by intravenous or oral routes. A transdermal opioid patch, such as fentanyl patch, can thus be effective in the treatment of patients with PAID following multiple cerebral insults.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000022536,PMC7535696,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

We describe a patient with left-hand writer's cramp with an old lesion in the left hemisphere and transient gait disturbance after right ventro-oral thalamotomy. A 43-year-old man had a hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia due to cerebral arteriovenous malformation at 22 years of age, and right hemiparesis remained as a sequela. He developed left-handed writing ability; however, he became aware of the stiffness of his left hand and difficulty in writing. Writer's cramp was diagnosed. Medical treatments were not effective, and right ventro-oral thalamotomy was performed. Although his writing ability improved, he could not walk. After performing rehabilitation, his walking completely improved, reaching the level before surgery, after 3 months, and his writer's cramp was completely cured. In patients with basal nucleus lesions, gait disturbance may appear transiently after contralateral thalamotomy.

Despite similarities among the clinical events, the neurological syndromes produced were dissimilar. Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia typically produces lesions of the globus pallidus that may result in an akinetic rigid syndrome. Due to its unique blood supply, vascular insufficiency is found to be a major factor. Lesions in the putamen also occur, and these tend to be associated with dystonia. Recent evidence supports a specific neuronal sensitivity in the striatum, possibly due to afferent excitatory amino acid connections. These two components and changes in the levels of neurotransmitters during hypoxia-ischemia may interact to produce varied clinical outcomes.

Its etiology may be idiopathic (primary) or it may arise secondary to focal brain injury. Acute respiratory distress as a feature of such dystonias occurs infrequently. A review of the literature on Meige syndrome and the relationship between dystonias and respiratory compromise is presented. A 60-year-old woman suffered a cerebral anoxic event secondary to manual strangulation. She developed progressive blepharospasm combined with oromandibular and cervical dystonias. Neuroimaging demonstrated bilateral damage localized to the globus pallidus. Years later, she presented to the emergency department in intermittent respiratory distress associated with facial and cervical muscle spasms. Increasing frequency and severity of the disorder was noted over years. The acute onset of respiratory involvement required intubation and eventual tracheotomy. A partial therapeutic benefit of tetrabenazine was demonstrated. This case highlights two interesting aspects of Meige's syndrome: (1) Focal bilateral basal ganglia lesions appear to be responsible for this patient's movement disorder which is consistent with relative overactivity of the direct pathway from striatum to globus pallidus internal and substantia nigra pars reticularis; (2) Respiratory involvement in a primarily craniofacial dystonia to the point of acute airway compromise.",{},,The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Chikungunya (CHIK) is an arbovirus responsible for outbreaks of fever, cutaneous rash and arthritis in underdeveloped countries, and a trigger for autoimmunity. <b>Case Presentation:</b> We report a five-year-old male patient with fever, myalgia, headache and conjunctivitis for 5 days. After 1 week he developed tonic-clonic seizures and evolved with dystonia and oromandibular dyskinesia followed by onset of focal motor seizures, decreased level of consciousness, dysautonomia and central apnea. Brain MRI was normal, CSF analysis revealed 15 cells, protein 16.6 mg/dL and glucose 68 mg/dL. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in serum and CSF after 3 weeks of symptom onset. CHIK serology was positive for both IgM and IgG, suggesting a recent infection. Dengue and Zika serologies were negative. CSF PCR for herpes viruses and arboviruses (CHIK, Dengue and Zika) were negative. <b>Conclusion:</b> We report the occurrence of anti-NMDAR encephalitis after acute CHIK infection. The biphasic course, positivity for both CHIK IgM and IgG and negative CHIK CSF PCR results, as well as a dramatic response to immunotherapy suggest an immune-mediated pathogenesis. Because of the global epidemic of CHIK infection and unknown mechanisms involving CHIK and autoimmunity, patients with acute CHIK infections and neurological manifestations should be considered for antineuronal antibody testing.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Frontiers in pediatrics,10.3389/fped.2020.00176,PMC7204150,Arboviral diseases; Chikungunya; anti-NMDAR; autoimmune; encephalitis,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

20012156,Osteochondroma of the convexity: pathologic-neuroimaging correlates of a lesion that mimics high-grade meningioma.,"Somerset, Hilary L; Kleinschmidt-DeMasters, B K; Rubinstein, David; Breeze, R E",Somerset,"Intracranial chondromas are uncommon benign lesions usually attached to dura and located over the convexity of the skull. Osteochondromas are even rarer and additionally contain a benign bony component. Both lesions are reportedly difficult to distinguish from meningiomas on pre-operative neuroimaging studies, although few detailed pathologic-neuroimaging correlation studies have appeared in the literature, particularly for intracranial osteochondromas. A 33-year-old woman with a 4-year history of headaches presented with recent onset of left-sided muscle spasms and weakness. Two days prior to admission to our hospital, neuroimaging studies had shown a large right convexity mass with unusual multifocal bright signal intensities throughout an otherwise isointense mass. The bright signals were interpreted as showing multifocal hemorrhage and the mass was felt to be a convexity meningioma. However, subsequent catheter angiography characterized the lesion as being avascular. The mass was resected en bloc. Extensive histological sectioning revealed a benign osteochondroma predominantly composed of lobules of hypocellular cartilage. Microdissection of the different components revealed that the multifocal, spicule-like bright foci interpreted as hemorrhage on neuroimaging studies were instead foci of benign bone containing metaplastic bone marrow with trilineage hematopoietic cell populations and adipose tissue. Centrally, the hilum of the lesion contained avascular loose connective tissue. No recent or remote hemorrhage was identified anywhere in the lesion. Rare convexity osteochondromas may be mistaken for high-grade meningiomas on neuroimaging studies; their avascular nature, coupled with their complex signal pattern can serve as clues to the correct pre-operative diagnosis.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Journal of neuro-oncology,10.1007/s11060-009-0089-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

A patient with subarachnoidal and cerebral hemorrhage was treated with pregabalin for neuropathic pain. Upon withdrawal of the medication she experienced spontaneous and painful supination in the right foot and internal hip rotation when standing up. When pregabalin was reinstituted, these dystonic symptoms subsided, but reappeared when the medication was again discontinued. One possible explanation for these symptoms could be neuronal hyperactivity within still-functioning pathways in connection with the motor cortex. Preponderance of activity in potentially compensatory structures could be suppressed by pregabalin: therefore, its potential benefit in subacute secondary dystonia in cases with orbital brain involvement is suggested.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-011-0737-7,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to study motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the following silent periods (SPs) in the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) of both sides and in the right extensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) during voluntary contractions performed outside the dystonic attacks. During the dystonic paroxysms, single-pulse TMS was used to investigate the time course of MEPs and SPs in both FDI and ECR of the right side. Furthermore, paired-pulse TMS was applied at rest to investigate short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in both FDI muscles. At rest SICI and ICF were normal in both motor cortices. During voluntary contraction the MEP was smaller and the SP was longer in the affected FDI than in the contralateral. During the paroxysms, the MEPs and SPs were suppressed in comparison with the responses elicited during voluntary contraction. These results fit well with the theory of ephaptic excitement of corticospinal axons for the pathogenesis of paroxysmal dystonia due to a demyelinating lesion.

Episodes presented with autonomic dysregulation including hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tachypnoea, tachycardia and hypertension. Concern for seizure activity prompted simultaneous video monitoring and EEG testing. Results were without epileptiform activity suggesting against seizure as cause for alternating hemibody spasms. Paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia (PAID) was considered despite the unusual presentation. Intravenous hydromorphone was used for treatment, which relieved symptoms of autonomic dysregulation and dystonic posturing. PAID syndrome was diagnosed based on presentation with intermittent episodes of dystonia, autonomic dysregulation, absence of epileptiform activity and rapid response to opioid treatment.

The concept that peripheral lesions to neural structures may be involved in the pathogenesis of movement disorders has been discussed controversely but has gained more widespread acceptance only recently. Here, we report on 6 patients who developed movement disorders after spinal disc surgery. The movement disorders became manifest with a delay of 1 day to 12 months after surgery. Of the six patients, 4 underwent cervical disc surgery, and 2 patients were operated on for lumbar disc herniation; 2 patients presented with paroxysmal kinesigenic segmental dystonia, 1 patient with focal dystonia, 2 with unilateral tremor, and 1 with bilateral tremor. The appearance of the movement disorder was associated with persistent dermatomal or segmental pain. In all patients, the anatomic distribution of the movement disorder was related to the nerve root or spinal segment of the corresponding disc level and the manifestation was in close temporal relation to the surgery. We conclude that spinal disc surgery may be another, thus far neglected, cause for movement disorders. The postoperative pain syndrome in all patients should be considered as an important factor of pathogenesis. Overall, movement disorders associated with disc surgery appear to be rare, yet they may cause significant discomfort to the affected individual.",{},,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,10.1002/mds.20152,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

To examine this hypothesis, we performed an electrophysiological evaluation of the excitability of the trigeminal nervous system in a patient affected by pineal cavernoma with pain symptoms in the orofacial region and pronounced bruxism. Electrophysiological studies included bilateral electrical transcranial stimulation of the trigeminal roots, analysis of the jaw jerk reflex, recovery cycle of masseter inhibitory reflex, and a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain. The neuromuscular responses of the left- and right-side bilateral trigeminal motor potentials showed a high degree of symmetry in latency (1.92 ms and 1.96 ms, respectively) and amplitude (11 mV and 11.4 mV, respectively), whereas the jaw jerk reflex amplitude of the right and left masseters was 5.1 mV and 8.9 mV, respectively. The test stimulus for the recovery cycle of masseter inhibitory reflex evoked both silent periods at an interstimulus interval of 150 ms. The duration of the second silent period evoked by the test stimulus was 61 ms and 54 ms on the right and left masseters, respectively, which was greater than that evoked by the conditioning stimulus (39 ms and 35 ms, respectively). We found evidence of activation and peripheral sensitization of the nociceptive fibers, the primary and secondary nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system, and the endogenous pain control systems (including both the inhibitory and facilitatory processes), in the tested subject. These data suggest that bruxism and central orofacial pain can coexist, but are two independent symptoms, which may explain why numerous experimental and clinical studies fail to reach unequivocal conclusions.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,10.1186/1744-9081-9-41,PMC3874619,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

38419706,Case report: Intrathecal baclofen therapy improved gait pattern in a stroke patient with spastic dystonia.,"Kim, Kyung Min; Lee, Tae Kwon; Lee, Su Min; Chang, Won Seok; Lee, Su Ji; Hwang, Jihye; Cho, Sung-Rae",Kim,"Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy, a viable alternative for unsuitable candidates of conventional spasticity medications, is a preferred method of administration over the oral route. Owing to its enhanced bioavailability, ITB ensures a more effective delivery at the target site. There is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the use of ITB treatment in managing ambulatory patients with spastic dystonia. Before ITB pump implantation, patients commonly undergo an ITB bolus injection trial to rule out potential adverse reactions and verify the therapeutic effects on hypertonic issues. In this report, we highlight a case of spastic dystonia, particularly focusing on an ambulatory patient who demonstrated significant improvement in both the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) score and gait pattern following the ITB injection trial. This case report outlines the medical history of a 67-year-old male diagnosed with left-side hemiplegia and spastic dystonia, resulting from his second episode of intracranial hemorrhage in the right thalamus. An ITB injection trial was initiated because the patient was not suitable for continued botulinum toxin injections and oral medications. This was due to the persistent occurrence of spastic dystonia in both the upper and lower extremities. The patient underwent a four-day ITB injection trial with progressively increasing doses, resulting in improved MAS scores and gait parameters, including cadence, step length, step time, stride length, and stride time were increased. Particularly, kinematic gait analysis demonstrates a substantial improvement of increased knee flexion in the swing phase in stiff knee gait pattern. These findings indicated a gradual reduction in spasticity-related symptoms, signifying the positive effect of the ITB injection trial. The patient eventually received an ITB pump implantation. In this post-stroke patient with spastic dystonia, ITB therapy has demonstrated effective and substantial management of spasticity, along with improvement in gait patterns.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2024.1330811,PMC10899344,baclofen; gait analysis; intrathecal baclofen; muscle hypertonia; spastic dystonia; stroke,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

While most of the nocturnal bruxism cases seen in the general population are apparently idiopathic, it has been reported to be associated with a range of neurological diseases such as Huntington's disease, cranio-cervical dystonia and post-anoxic brain damage, but not multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe three cases of MS patients who have had moderate to severe complaints of bruxism in the two weeks following their relevant MS attacks. None of the three patients had a diagnosis of bruxism prior to her attack. The diagnosis was confirmed in one out of three by a polysomnography. One patient did not have any complaints related to bruxism previous to her attack, whereas two had mild and infrequent complaints. The symptoms of the relevant attacks were left hemihypesthesia in all and hemiparesis in two. None of the patients had spasticity that could result in severe teeth clenching. All three patients presented with morning headaches and jaw pain or tightness and were treated successfully with botulinum toxin (Btx) injections applied to their masseter and temporalis muscles. The cause of bruxism is controversial but lesions of the cortico-basalganglia-thalamo-cotrical loops are thought to be most likely. However, acute or chronic lesions in those pathways were not demonstrated in the 3 patients. It is feasible that they had normal appearing white matter interruptions in their cortico-basalganglia-thalamocortical loops along with their relevant attack.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '14'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,10.1016/j.msard.2015.06.006,,Attack; Botulinum toxin; Bruxism; Multiple sclerosis; Treatment,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

She was found to have total occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with focal stenosis of the proximal right A-1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery adjacent to the remnants of the chondrosarcoma. These focal areas of narrowing were attributed to accelerated atherosclerotic disease, an adverse effect of the radiotherapy used to treat her chondrosarcoma.

Little has been added to the understanding of this disorder since the detailed, early clinical and pathological descriptions. The spectrum of clinical presentations can be neuropsychiatric (apathy, lethargy, excessive somnolence), a movement disorder (ataxia, tremor, chorea, parkinsonism, myoclonus, dystonia), or both. Cortical laminar necrosis and polymicrocavitation in the cortex and basal ganglia are combined with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Microscopically, Alzheimer type II astrocytes and cytoplasmic glycogen granules are characteristic. Recent neuroradiological observations in patients with liver failure have shown a specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance with a hyperintense T1 signal in the pallidum, putamen, and, rarely, mesencephalon. Using clues from a similar MR appearance in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition as well as animals given parenteral manganese, and the knowledge that manganese is cleared by the hepatobiliary system, deposition of manganese in the brain is postulated in patients with CAHD.

A 64-year-old man noticed a sudden onset of mild weakness in his left hand and also difficulty in preventing his head from dropping onto his chest without weakness of the neck extensor muscles. Magnetic resonance images showed acute ischemic changes at the right putamen and caudate nucleus. Surface electromyography (EMG) performed 3 days after the stroke showed that both trapeziuses were hypertonic at rest, whereas the activity of the sternocleidomastoids was gradually increased on passive head lifting, indicating dystonia of the neck muscles. His dropped head fully improved by 9 days after the stroke. Re-examination by surface EMG 30 days after the stroke showed no hypertonic activity in the neck muscles. DHS is characterized by an abnormal ante-fixed posture of the neck, usually observed in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and Parkinson disease. This is the first case of reversible DHS after acute ischemic stroke, and the accumulation of similar cases will be important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the development of DHS and stroke-associated movement disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.05.017,,Kubisagari; basal ganglia; cervical dystonia; stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

This helps in making sense of the loss of the sense of self they experience. Gender, premorbid personality, and socio-cultural discourses guide this process of understanding. Narrative formulation takes these considerations into account and, thus, can be used for formulating therapeutic plans. To present a case report which highlights the use of narrative case formulation to understand the psychological, social, and cultural factors forming the dominant discourse of a woman with ABI. Ms. VA, a 43-year-old female, presented herself with a diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with small chronic infarcts with gliosis in the bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, myoclonic seizures, mild cognitive impairment, depression, generalized dystonia, and bronchial asthma. Along with neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive retraining, 25 sessions of psychotherapy using narrative formulation were performed. Following the therapy, microgains such as a developing strong therapeutic relationship, accommodating vulnerability in her narrative, and finding moments of independence and assertion within the constraints of ABI were observed. Acceptance of her current predicament vis-à-vis her lost self and finding meaning in her new self were facilitated. There is paucity of research detailing psychotherapeutic management of ABI, especially in India. Psychotherapy, particularly using narrative formulation, can be helpful in understanding the intersections of gender role and expectations, premorbid personality and ABI, and aiding the post-ABI rehabilitation and adjustment. Future work in this area can explore the socio-cultural aspects that play an important role in the therapy process.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '20'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Consortium psychiatricum,10.17816/CP15477,PMC11249398,case report; narrative therapy for ABI; neuropsychological rehabilitation,Case Reports; Journal Article,Russia (Federation),eng

After experiencing an initial coma for several days, the patient was found to have a right-sided homonymous hemianopsia and a right hemiparesis, which was more marked at the shoulder and was accompanied by preservation of finger movement. Dystonic movements appeared 2 months later and progressed, along with increased spasticity on volition, to severe uncontrolled arm movements at 2 years postinjury. This motor disorder continued to worsen during the following 6 years prior to the patient's death. At autopsy, the left side of the brain was observed to have marked atrophy of the optic tract, a partial lesion of the posterior portion of the medial segment of the globus pallidus (GP), and a reduction in the size of the internal capsule at the level of the GP, suggesting impaired circulation to these areas at the time of injury. The isolated lesion of the internal segment of the GP was the presumed cause of the dystonia, acting through an alteration in thalamic inhibition.

22116988,Postthalamic stroke dystonic choreoathetosis responsive to tetrabenazine.,"Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore; Polimeni, Giovanni; Gervasi, Giuseppe; Bramanti, Placido",Calabrò,"To describe the case of a woman with poststroke choreoathetosis whose symptoms improved after treatment with tetrabenazine. A 48-year-old left-handed woman developed progressive involuntary dystonic choreoathetoid movements of her arm following a cerebrovascular event. Involuntary abnormal movements (IAMs) were treated with haloperidol, but they worsened 6 months later, also involving her mouth, tongue, and perioral area. Because of the suspected occurrence of drug-induced tardive dyskinesia, treatment was switched to tetrabenazine (titration up to 100 mg/daily), with rapid remission of the involuntary abnormal movements (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale score switching from 20 to 1). One month later, following discontinuation of tetrabenazine, the dystonic choreoathetoid movements rapidly reappeared. Subsequent rechallenge with tetrabenazine caused remission of her symptoms. Poststroke IAMs are rare, and lesions involving the basal ganglia and/or thalamus seem to be particularly implicated in such disorders. The exact pathogenic mechanism has not been clarified; however, it has been postulated that a central dopaminergic overactivity might play an important role in the IAM occurrence. Thus, antipsychotics are the main treatment option, but they are often associated with therapeutic failure or adverse effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic complications. Interestingly, when our patient was treated with tetrabenazine for haloperidol-induced tardive dyskinesia, she demonstrated substantial improvement in the dystonic choreoathetoid movements of her left upper limb. The improved response of this case to tetrabenazine monotherapy suggests that tetrabenazine may be a pharmacologic alternative for patients with poststroke choreoathetosis that is intolerant or unresponsive to antipsychotic agents. Further studies are needed to better define the risk versus benefit profile of tetrabenazine.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,10.1345/aph.1Q366,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the presence of extensive periventricular white matter lesions that did not enhance after gadolinium injection. As low titers of cytomegalovirus-IgM antibodies were found in the serum, a presumed diagnosis of postviral acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was made, and the patient received a 5-day course of 1 g methylprednisolone. The clinical and radiological outcome was very rapidly favorable, and subsequent brain MRIs in 2007 and 2008 were normal. In March 2011, the patient was readmitted with the complaints of abnormal fatigue, imbalance, and speech disorder. The neurological examination showed fluctuating spatiotemporal disorientation with dyscalculia, verbal deafness, gait ataxia, right hemianopia, and pyramidal signs in the four limbs. The brain MRI demonstrated extensive T(2) hyperintense white matter lesions predominating in the left temporal and parieto-occipital lobes, with a pseudotumoral aspect enhancing with gadolinium contrast. A clinical improvement was transiently noted after pulse steroid therapy, but after relapse and radiological worsening, the diagnosis of recurrent ADEM was challenged. The brain biopsy confirmed the presence of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) under the variant form of lymphomatosis cerebri. Despite a partial response to chemotherapy, the patient died 8 months after the diagnosis. We discuss the role of sentinel lesions that may precede PCNSL for several years and insist on the importance to consider early brain biopsy in the presence of extensive, non-enhancing white matter lesions, even in a young and immunocompetent patient.","DictElement({'Year': '2012', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2012,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000343947,PMC3506038,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; Lymphomatosis cerebri; Primary central nervous system lymphoma; Sentinel lesions; Steroids,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

This syndrome should prompt lesional evaluation with neuroimaging focused on the dorsal midbrain, cerebellar outflow tracts, and thalamus. Herein we report a 26-year-old previously healthy male who presented with 4 years of progressive horizontal diplopia, right Parinaud syndrome, and appendicular ataxia. Neuroimaging revealed a right dorsal midbrain enhancing lesion which completely resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone prompting a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory syndrome. Subsequent clinical and radiographic evaluations, however, revealed steadily progressive left dorsal midbrain syndrome with an expansile enhancing lesion which culminated 4 years from symptom onset with a right upper extremity low-frequency rest, postural and action tremor, ataxic dysarthria, and mild right dystonia with dysdiadochokinesia. Uncomplicated brainstem biopsy confirmed intracranial germinoma and the patient underwent definitive radiation therapy with dramatic radiographic response and partial clinical improvement. This case, which to our knowledge is only the second report of intracranial germinoma presenting as Holmes' tremor, highlights the critical importance of definitive tissue diagnosis in the evaluation of lesional brainstem pathology presenting as Holmes' tremor. Steroid responsiveness can be seen in non-inflammatory pathology including intracranial germinoma. Prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment are important as Holmes' tremor responds poorly to symptomatic therapies and response to radiation therapy is favorable for germinomas.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,10.1016/j.jocn.2014.11.013,PMC4866638,Behçet’s disease; Germinoma; Holmes tremor; Multiple sclerosis; Rubral tremor,Case Reports; Journal Article,Scotland,eng

We report the case of a 45-year-old patient with no history of any medical condition who presented to our clinic with left-sided torticollis. Interestingly, MRI scan of the brain revealed multiple periventricular T2 hyperintense lesions. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed that cell numbers and protein concentration were normal, while oligoclonal IgG synthesis was suggestive of chronic intrathecal inflammation. Therefore, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) was diagnosed as a primary manifestation of relapsing-remitting MS. In the MRI scans, one lesion was found to be localized to the right cerebral peduncle, thus providing a potential link between torticollis and the autoimmune disorder. Furthermore, the symptoms were completely resolved with corticosteroid treatment alone. This is to our knowledge the first description of an MS case in which the sole primary manifestation was torticollis that could be completely resolved with corticosteroid treatment. We therefore suggest performing a cerebral MRI scan with particular focus on demyelinating lesions in patients with focal dystonia, since there is an increasing number of reports describing MS as a potential cause of secondary dystonia.

He subsequently developed hemiballismus in the right lower limb and dystonia of the distal right upper limb spreading proximally to involve the shoulder. The ballistic movement of the lower limb was severe enough to cause the patient to fall out of his chair and limit his ability to perform activities of daily living safely. He had been on various oral medications and received botulinum toxin and phenol injections, but none alleviated the symptoms. The patient elected to receive the ITB pump. Before ITB, he had an average of 10-12 ballism episodes of the right lower limb per hour. During observed episodes, the right hip would flex up to about 90 degrees, with a fully extended knee. After ITB pump implantation and upward dose titration, the frequency of ballistic right leg movements decreased to about three per day, and the right hip flexed to only 30 degrees. In addition, there was increased ability to isolate individual distal joint movements in the right lower limb.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO₂) therapy reduces the incidence of cognitive and neurological a dysfunction. The efficacy of providing HBO₂ beyond the first one to two days after initial insult is unknown. However, some evidence exists for the benefit of this treatment. We report on treating a patient 14 months after CO injury, who responded with markedly improved neurologic status. A 27-year-old scholar was found comatose due to CO poisoning (carboxyhemoglobin = 31.7%). He received five acute HBO₂ treatments. After discharge, he developed chorea, Parkinsonism, dystonia, memory loss, slowed processing speed and verbal fluency, leaving him disabled. After the patient reached a clinical plateau, HBO₂ was tried again at 90 minutes at 2.4 ATA plus air breaks. Neuropsychological testing was performed at baseline and after each 20 HBO₂ cycles, five of which were performed during the period from 14-22 months after CO exposure. After the first 20 treatments, Parkinsonism and dystonia improved. After 40 sessions, further improvements were seen on mental speed, verbal fluency, and fine motor movements. The outcome following 100 treatments was that the patient regained independence, including the ability to drive and to become gainfully employed. Our case calls into question the concept that HBO₂ therapy has no role during the chronic phase of CO brain injury. Randomized clinical trials should be considered to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HBO₂ in patients with neurological sequelae following CO injury.",{},,"Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc",,,carbon monoxide poisoning; delay to treatment; hyperbaric oxygen,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

RSWT have never been used to treat spasticity in disabled athletes. An athlete affected by tetraparesis due to CP underwent three RSWT sessions in a week. We assessed muscular tone using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), pain and fatigue experienced during athletic performance with Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and Borg scale Category-Ratio anchored at number 10 (Borg CR10). We also performed an electrophysiological study recording the stretch reflex on the quadriceps femori muscle and assessing the soleus H-reflex to calculate post-activation depression (PAD). After 3 RSWT sessions, we found a reduction in all clinical parameters. Although MAS was unchanged, stretch reflex was significantly reduced and PAD increased, suggesting a role in contrasting non-reflex components of hypertonia. The use of RSWT may improve the disabled athletes' performance.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,10.23736/S1973-9087.16.03991-5,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

It is thought to result from right hemispheric dysfunction or interhemispheric disequilibrium, which provides a neuroanatomical model for illness unawareness in schizophrenia. Lack of insight contributes to medication nonadherence and poor treatment outcomes and is often refractory to pharmacological and psychological interventions. We present the first report of transient illness awareness (<8 hours) after individual bilateral electroconvulsive therapy treatments in the case of a 39-year-old man with antipsychotic refractory schizophrenia. Electroencephalography demonstrated frontal slow wave activity with shifting frontotemporal predominance, which was concurrent with the patient's transient level of insight. A systematic review of the literature on electroconvulsive therapy-induced illness awareness in schizophrenia and psychotic disorders produced zero relevant results.

One patient had a parietal cortex injury, one had a thalamic infarction, two had spinal cord lesions, two had dorsal root ganglion neuronopathies, and one had an ulnar neuropathy. In each case, the duration of abnormal movements correlated with the duration of proprioceptive sensory loss, and the abnormal movements were restricted to body parts with proprioceptive sensory loss. The movements varied from chorea and athetosis to dystonia. These cases suggest that proprioceptive sensory loss can lead to a movement disorder, termed pseudochoreoathetosis, which occurs following the appearance of lesions anywhere along proprioceptive sensory pathways, from peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex. It is hypothesized that pseudochoreoathetosis occurs because of the failure to process limb proprioceptive information in the striatum. Therefore, both choreoathetosis and pseudochoreoathetosis may be manifestations of the failure of the striatum to properly integrate cortical motor and sensory inputs.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.1994.00540230041010,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Following this episode, he presented a severe parkinsonian syndrome which was associated, after a few years, with an axial dystonia and stereotyped involuntary movements of the upper limbs. These abnormal movements were particular by their coordinated appearance, their rhythmicity and their relative slowness. Treatment with L-dopa suppressed all akinetic, dystonic and dyskinetic symptoms. At age of 40 years, all the akinetic, dystonic and dyskinetic symptoms reappeared after drug withdrawal. Cerebral computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were normal. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography revealed a significant bilateral reduction of tracer accumulation in the posterior part of both putamen, similar to that observed in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In this patient, pharmacological tests revealed that effectiveness of L-dopa was abolished by administration of a D2 antagonist, and was fully reproduced by a D2 agonist. Clinical signs, pharmacological data and past-medical history strongly suggested a limited lesion of the zona compacta of substantia nigra induced by viral agression. This complex and progressive extrapyramidal syndrome had strong similarities with the lethargic encephalitis of Von Economo and its late symptoms.
