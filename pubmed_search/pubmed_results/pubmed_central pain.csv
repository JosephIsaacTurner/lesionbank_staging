24210074,Thalamic cramplike pain.,"Sposato, Luciano A; Sharma, Harish A; Khan, Ali R; Bartha, Robert; Hachinski, Vladimir",Sposato,"We describe a case of cramplike pain after a left thalamic ischemic stroke, a neglected type of central post-stroke pain and we describe its neuroanatomical correlates. A 68-year-old right-handed man presented with right arm, leg, and flank cramplike pain noted upon awakening. Neurological examination was normal, with no evidence of objective sensory abnormalities. Because of the nature of the pain and the preserved sensory function, we first did not consider stroke as a potential cause, and suspected that pain was related to the combined effect of intense physical exercising on the right side and the use of statins. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute ischemic infarction within the left thalamus. By registering high-resolution 3 T T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to the Talairach atlas, we showed the infarction is within the border between the pulvinar and the ventral posterior medial nuclei. Brodmann's areas 3, 1, 2, 4 and 6 were identified as the cortical correlates of the ischemic lesion by diffusion tensor tractography. Thalamic cramplike pain should be recognized as a type of central post-stroke pain, probably produced by lesions localized to the border between the ventral posterior and pulvinar nuclei and connected to the ipsilateral primary somatosensory cortex and primary and secondary motor cortices.","DictElement({'Year': '2013', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2013,Journal of the neurological sciences,10.1016/j.jns.2013.10.026,,Cerebrovascular; Cramps; Neuroanatomy; Pain; Stroke; Thalamus; Topography; Tractography,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,eng

A case report and narrative review.,"Pigna, Federica; Lana, Silvia; Bellini, Carlotta; Bonfanti, Laura; Creta, Michele; Cervellin, Gianfranco",Pigna,"Spinal cord infarction is a rare but severe disorder, consistently less frequent than ischemic brain injury. It constitutes only 1-2% of all neurological vascular emergencies. Here we describe a case of spinal cord infarction in a 68-year-old Caucasian man without any neurological problem in his clinical history. The patient presented to the Emergency Department complaining for sudden onset of lower limbs weakness, as well as pain and mild loss of sensitivity in both legs. These symptoms suddenly arose after a 10 minutes bicycle race. He underwent a CT angiography, which confirmed the presence of a fusiform aneurysm of infra-renal abdominal aorta with thrombotic apposition on right lateral side and some ulcerated thrombi. As such, the patient underwent a spinal cord Magnetic Resonance Imaging, that showed images compatible with an acute ischemic injury (infarction) from D11 to medullary cone. He was then treated with low molecular weight heparin, aspirin, and methylprednisolone, and was then admitted to the Stroke Unit. He gradually regained lower limbs sensitivity totally, but the strength was only partially restored. Although a rare entity, Emergency Physicians should always keep in mind this possibility when evaluating patients with sudden loss of sensitivity and/or strength in their lower limbs.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,10.23750/abm.v92iS1.8395,PMC8142748,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Italy,eng

Biopsy obtained using a frameless stereotactic biopsy showed sharply defined cell borders, clear cytoplasm, and rounded nuclei consistent with an oligodendroglioma.

The clinical examination on admission revealed an incomplete Wallenberg syndrome, associating hemiface sensitive deficit, Horner's syndrome, dysmetria and nystagmus. The brain MRI showed a latero-medullary infarct with a homolateral PICA thrombosed dissecting aneurysm. The diagnosis of intracranial dissecting aneurysms needs particular caution because aneurysm sac thrombosis can give false reassurance on angiographic MR sequences. Moreover, the anatomic features of intracranial artery walls make them prone to sub-adventitial dissection and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhages. Therefore, antithrombotic therapy should be used with caution, due to the risk of bleeding in these intracranial dissections.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,10.1007/s10072-022-05923-1,,Aneurysm sac thrombosis; Arterial intracranial dissection; Dissection aneurysm; Ischemic stroke,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Herein, we present a case of delayed CVT diagnosis due to nonspecific neurological symptoms and nonprominent lesions in a patient with HH. A 65-year-old woman presented with a sudden onset headache accompanied by right HH that lasted for 1 day. Brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were initially performed due to suspicion of ischemic lesions or hemorrhage in the left postchiasmal visual pathway; however, no remarkable acute brain lesions were detected. Ophthalmological examinations revealed no notable findings, except for a definite field defect in the Humphrey visual field test. The headaches then waxed and waned but recurred 3 days after the initial symptom.A repeat brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which revealed left sectoral gyral swelling and vascular enhancement in the occipital lobe. To further evaluate venous drainage, additional 3-dimensional cerebral computed tomography angiography and 4-vessel angiography were conducted, revealing a partial filling defect in the left transverse sinus and superior venous drainage impairment. These findings suggested the presence of venous thrombosis in the left transverse sinus. The patient was diagnosed with thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, which subsequently caused the right HH. Anticoagulation therapy with parenteral heparin was started as soon as the diagnosis of CVT was confirmed. Eventually, the patient was solely managed with oral warfarin administration. Following 3 days of treatment, her headache resolved, and a subsequent visual field testing conducted 2 weeks later revealed a definite improvement in the field defect. Despite its favorable prognosis, CVT can be challenging to diagnose. CVT should be considered as a differential diagnosis when diagnosing patients who present with headaches accompanied by HH without prominent brain lesions.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000036204,PMC10754574,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

To describe the features of TGN-SCAA based on 8 cases (7 from literature +1 illustrative case). All cases were thoroughly studied with gathering of their epidemiological, radiological, clinical, therapeutic, and outcome data. The mean age at diagnosis was 61 yr. Gender distribution showed a female predominance (M: F = 2:6). Side distribution had a left dominance (75%). The aneurysms mean size was 15.4 mm (range: 5-27). All 5 proximal SCAAs (SCA-Basilar junction) presented a lateral-posterior projection, while all 3 distal SCAAs (s2 segment) had variable projections but constant direct trigeminal nerve (TN) contact. No hemorrhage occurred. TGN was the clinical onset in all 8 cases. The most frequent pain distribution was V1-2-3 (n = 3), followed by V1-2 (n = 1) and V1 alone (n = 1). Proximal SCAAs caused TGN through direct TN compression (n = 1), third nerve compression (n = 1), cavernous sinus compression (n = 1), or a combination thereof (n = 2). However, all distal SCAAs caused TGN by direct TN compression (n = 3). Two different treatment options were used: clipping (n = 4) and coiling (n = 4).

The development of PRES after delivery is unusual. Magnetic resonance imaging represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of this condition. White matter oedema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres is typical on neuroimaging. PRES is reversible when early diagnosis is established and appropriate treatment is started without delay. The pathogenesis of PRES is discussed and the importance of a prompt diagnosis is emphasized, as the crucial role of rapid blood press reduction.

On initial MRI a grade 4 arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was identified in the right occipital lobe, which was further characterized by catheter angiography. Continued worsening of the headache in the following days prompted a follow-up MRI, which revealed a new T2 hypointense nodule and adjacent vasogenic edema in the periphery of the AVM. A follow-up MRI showed a marked increase in the size of the nodule with intrinsic enhancement and worsening perilesional edema. Based on the imaging evolution, the nodule was diagnosed as a metastasis and the patient was started on chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One week after the MRI he developed a sudden hemorrhage within the mass requiring decompression craniectomy and resection of both AVM and tumor.

29748058,Unusual Aspect of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in an Elderly Adult.,"Hebant, Benjamin; Bennani, Omar",Hebant,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) classically occurs in patients presenting with a sudden increase of arterial pressure or eclampsia, but the range of etiologies is very wide. Although the mechanisms underlying PRES remain unclear, research suggests that when the extent of hypertension exceeds the threshold of cerebral blood flow autoregulation, this induces blood-brain barrier disruption that leads to brain edema. Unusual presentations on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are possible, including the involvement of frontal or temporal lobes, cerebellar hemispheres, basal ganglia, brainstem, or deep white matter. However, in these atypical locations, edema is mostly accompanied by the classical parieto-occipital region involvement. We report the case of an elderly adult presenting with an unusual presentation of PRES with exclusive involvement of the frontal lobes, associated with severe hypertension. In our case, computed tomography and MRI abnormalities were exclusively localized in the frontal regions without involvement of the classical parieto-occipital regions. A favorable clinical course after hypertension management and complete clearance on an MRI scan at 3 months' follow-up confirmed the diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: PRES is a condition potentially encountered by many doctors, especially in the emergency department. However, atypical clinical or imaging presentations are possible and could delay the diagnosis. These must be known to begin adequate treatment as quickly as possible.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.04.008,,elderly adult; hypertension; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Nevertheless, a symptomatic form was recently found in a patient with a skull base meningioma abutting the trigeminal nerve. Here we report on a patient with facial pain with the features of epicrania fugax occurring after Wallenberg's syndrome. Case report A 53-year-old man suffered a right-sided dorsolateral medullary ischaemic stroke. Nine months later, he presented with brief electric shock-like paroxysms of pain stemming from the right eye and radiating to the ipsilateral forehead, the temple or the cheek in a zigzag trajectory. Some episodes were accompanied by ipsilateral conjunctival injection and eyelid oedema. Treatment with eslicarbazepine abolished the pain. Conclusion A pain with the features of epicrania fugax may be associated with medullary lesions. This finding suggests that the central trigeminal pathways and/or the spinal trigeminal nucleus may play an important role in the pathophysiology of this type of pain.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,10.1177/0333102417726334,,Facial pain; brainstem infarction; lateral medullary infarction,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We report an unusual cerebral glial tumor in a 66-year-old woman with generalized tonic-clonic seizure; the patient also had a 6-year history of headache. On MRI, the tumor appeared as a large T2-hyperintense lesion involving the right insular gyri-anterior temporal lobe, with post-contrast enhancement in the insula region. Histopathologically, the tumor involving the insular cortex-subcortical white matter was composed of GFAP-positive glial cells showing two different morphologies: one type had monomorphous bipolar cytoplasm and was angiocentric with circumferential alignment to the blood vessels, with dot-like structures positive for epithelial membrane antigen and a Ki-67 labeling index of <1%, and the other was apparently astrocytic, being diffusely and more widely distributed in the parenchyma, showing mitoses and a Ki-67 labeling index of >5%. In the anterior temporal lobe, a diffuse increase in the number of astrocytic cells was evident in part of the cortex and subcortical white matter. On the basis of these findings, we considered whether the present tumor may represent an unusual example of AG with infiltrating astrocytic cells showing primary anaplastic features (AG with anaplastic features), or anaplastic astrocytoma showing primary vascular-associated ependymal differentiation (anaplastic astrocytoma with angiocentric ependymal differentiation). At present, the latter appears to be the more appropriate interpretation.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,10.1111/j.1440-1789.2010.01161.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Australia,eng

We herein report the first case of a pineal cavernous malformation with superficial siderosis. Radiological findings were helpful in identifying the presence of the cavernous malformation. A 47-year-old female presented with a 4-month history of progressive headache, nausea, and dizziness. She complained of double vision and exhibited upward gaze palsy and papilledema on fundoscopy. Radiological examination revealed subacute hemorrhage in the pineal region and enlarged lateral ventricles. Furthermore, T2-star-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a linear hypointensity along the pial surface of the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum, indicating hemosiderin deposition consistent with superficial siderosis. Suspecting the presence of a cavernous malformation based on the radiological findings of superficial siderosis, we performed total mass resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and her preoperative symptoms resolved completely. Radiological findings of superficial siderosis on T2-star-weighted gradient-echo imaging are useful to making a diagnosis of cavernous malformation in cases of pineal apoplexy.

32434693,Is the analgesic effect of motor cortex stimulation somatotopically driven or not?,"Pommier, Benjamin; Quesada, Charles; Nuti, Christophe; Peyron, Roland; Vassal, François",Pommier,"Mechanisms of analgesic efficacy related to motor cortex stimulation (MCS) remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether pain relief is somatotopically driven or not. We present three illustrative case-reports of MCS in which unintentional stimulation setting errors occurred, leading to differential (and reversible) pain relief outcomes across the hemi-body. After successful preoperative rTMS trials, three patients suffering from post-stroke pain were selected for MCS. Stimulation was set with the aim of activating two epidural electrodes over the somatotopic representation of the lower and upper limbs. Data regarding pain relief were prospectively collected. At the first follow-up, all three patients complained of a lack of pain relief in the lower limb, contrasting with good outcome in the upper limb. In fact, for each of them we diagnosed the same stimulation setting error, to which they were ""blinded"", i.e., the parasagittal electrode over the somatotopic representation of the lower limb was inadvertently turned off. Subsequently, six months after having the electrode turned on (still in a ""blinded"" fashion), all three patients described substantial pain relief in the lower limb, with a median improvement of 50% (range: 40-70%). These incidental case reports argue in favor of a genuine and at least partly somatotopically-driven analgesic efficacy of MCS. Therefore, the parasagittal electrode seems crucial when treating lower limb pain with MCS.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology,10.1016/j.neucli.2020.04.002,,Central pain; Motor cortex stimulation; Neuropathic pain; Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; Somatotopy,Case Reports; Journal Article,France,eng

In a literature review of 73 cases, SAH associated with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) was usually seen at the cerebral convexities. SAH was adjacent to thrombosed venous structures; therefore, the most possible explanation seems to be the rupture of cortical veins due to extension of thrombosis. Computed tomography (CT) was effective for diagnosis of CVT in only 32% of the cases.

38545283,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for thalamic pain syndrome: case report.,"Slade, John Benjamin; Kwan, Nathan; Lennox, Peter; Gray, Russell",Slade,"Thalamic pain syndrome is a distressing type of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) that occurs in up to 10% of cases following a cerebrovascular accident, typically with a delayed onset of signs and symptoms, and is often chronic or even life-long. Thalamic pain syndrome, as is the case for other CPSPs, is difficult to treat, and the response is typically moderate at best. Central pain also occurs after vascular insults in parts of the CNS other than the thalamus. Only a few patients present with the classic ""Dejerine and Roussy syndrome,"" so the term CPSP is preferred for describing neuropathic pain after stroke. There are no pathognomonic features of this syndrome. The thalamus probably has a substantial role in some patients with central pain, either as a pain generator or by abnormal processing of ascending input. Long-term post-stroke pain disorders can reduce the quality of life, affect mood, sleep, and social functioning, and can lead to suicide. Hemi-body pain is common in patients with thalamic lesions. Hyperbaric oxygen has known physiologic and pharmacologic effects with documented benefits in brain-related hemorrhages, acute and chronic stroke, traumatic brain injury, mild cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroprotection, but has never been reported as a treatment for thalamic pain syndrome. A 55-year-old man with a history of migraines suffered a right thalamic lacunar infarction following a brain angiogram to investigate a suspected AVM found on prior imaging that resulted in immediate left-sided weakness and numbness, evolving to severe chronic pain and subsequent stiffness. Diagnosed with thalamic pain syndrome, multiple pharmacologic therapies provided only partial relief for a year after the stroke. The patient's symptoms resolved and quality of life markedly improved with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as assessed by multiple validated questionnaires, thus it may be a treatment option for thalamic pain syndrome.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Frontiers in neurology,10.3389/fneur.2024.1364716,PMC10965551,case report; central post-stroke pain; hyperbaric oxygen; post-stroke thalamic pain; thalamic pain syndrome,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

37485837,Stellate ganglion block to mitigate thalamic pain syndrome of an oncological origin.,"Wilkinson, Alex J; Yang, Ajax; Chen, Grant H",Wilkinson,"Thalamic pain syndrome (TPS) is an enigmatic and rare condition. Thalamic pain syndrome is under the umbrella of central pain syndrome, which is classically associated with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, postamputation, epilepsy, stroke, tumor, and Parkinson's disease. The mainstay treatment of TPS is polypharmacy. There is uncertainty about the intermediate options to manage medication-resistant TPS before resorting to invasive, and often expensive, intracranial therapies. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has shown promise in reducing TPS symptoms of the upper extremity and face following a thalamic ischemic event. Discuss the effect and potential utility of SGB on ipsilateral headache, facial, and upper extremity neuropathic pain due to thalamic malignancies. A review of two patient records that underwent SGB for treatment of TPS of oncologic origin. We present two cases of the successful use of SGB for the treatment of oncologic-related TPS for patients who had failed other conservative pharmacologic measures. Chronic pain is a complex experience that often simultaneously involves psychosocial, neuropathic, and nociceptive constituents. Among advanced cancer patients, factors such as an individual's spirituality, psychological stressors, and views on their mortality add layers of intricacy in addressing their pain. While TPS has been characterized in both stroke populations and oncologic populations, the treatment of SGB for pain relief in TPS has been limited to the stroke population. Repeated SGB worked to alleviate the ipsilateral headache, facial, and upper extremity pain in these two patients. The benefits of utilization of SGB, with the possibility of pain relief, within the thalamic malignancy population cannot be understated. In summary, ultrasound-guided SGB may be considered in patients with TPS due to thalamic cancer, before pursuing more invasive intracranial surgeries to treat pain.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,10.1111/papr.13275,,autonomic nerve blocks; cancer; pain disorder; sympathetic ganglia,Review; Case Reports,United States,eng

7628912,Resolution of Lhermitte's sign in multiple sclerosis by treatment with weak electromagnetic fields.,"Sandyk, R; Dann, L C",Sandyk,"Lhermitte's sign, the occurrence of an electrical sensation passing down the back to the legs on flexion of the neck is a common and characteristic feature of multiple sclerosis (MS) which is related to spinal cord lesions affecting the posterior columns and cervical nerve roots. The Lhermitte's sign, which has been reported to occur at some time in up to 25% of MS patients, is seldom painful but is often a cause of distress to the patient and usually a marker of increased disease activity. Treatment with extracranial picotesla range pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMFs) has been found efficacious in the management of various MS symptoms including pain syndromes. The present communication concerns three MS patients in whom two brief applications of EMFs resulted in resolution of the Lhermitte's sign which emerged during a period of exacerbation of symptoms in one patient and during a prolonged phase of symptom deterioration in the other two patients. As the cause of the Lhermitte's sign is thought to result from the spread of ectopic excitation in demyelinated plaques in the cervical and thoracic regions of the spinal cord, it is hypothesized that the effects of EMFs are related to the reduction of axonal excitability via a mechanism involving changes in ionic membrane permeability. A systemic effect on pain control systems is also postulated to occur secondary to the effects of EMFs on neurotransmitter activity and pineal melatonin functions. This report underscores the efficacy of picotesla EMFs in the management of paroxysmal pain symptoms in MS.",{},,The International journal of neuroscience,10.3109/00207459509004888,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

The headache characteristic was migranous, being described as throbbing in nature and located to the right frontal area with associated blurring of vision. Although similar to prior frequent headaches, there was now increasing unsteadiness on walking. Diagnosed 10 years earlier with Behçet's disease, the initial presentation was with oral and genital ulceration. Recurrent episodes of headache caused by neurological flare-ups resulted in a stroke at the age of 46 years.

Surveillance brain imaging (computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging with venography) 10 months earlier showed brainstem disease activity (Figure 1a) with disease quiescence a month later (Figure 1b) following an escalation of immunosuppressant therapy. Regular medications comprised prednisolone 10 mg (however, regular recurrences had resulted in him taking doses of between 20 and 30 mg/day of prednisolone for most of the past 24 months) and azathioprine 150 mg daily, aspirin 75 mg daily, one adcal D3 twice daily with weekly alendronic acid, and omeprazole 20 mg daily.

The most common DBS targets for pain are the periventricular gray region (PVG) and the ventralis caudalis of the thalamus. Despite the limited success of DBS for CPSP, few alternative targets have been explored. The nucleus accumbens (NAC), a limbic structure within the ventral striatum that is involved in reward and pain processing, has emerged as an effective target for psychiatric disease. There is also evidence that it may be an effective target for pain. We describe a 72-year-old woman with a large right hemisphere infarct who subsequently experienced refractory left hemibody pain. She underwent placement of 3 electrodes in the right PVG, ventralis caudalis of the thalamus, and NAC. Individual stimulation of the NAC and PVG provided substantial improvement in pain rating.

Three months later, he developed constant and burning pain within the entire right side of his body. He was diagnosed with central pain syndrome and treated with antiepileptics and tricyclic antidepressants. Minimal analgesia was achieved, which was limited by intractable sedation and drowsiness. Patient was then treated with oral opioids (morphine and hydrocodone with acetaminophen) in escalating doses that produced cognitive impairment. After an opioid rotation was attempted, by switching morphine to transdermal fentanyl, there was no pain reduction or improved quality of life. A trial of buprenorphine was initiated, by administering transdermal patches in escalating doses in weekly intervals. Patient's pain was eventually successfully controlled with buprenorphine patch 60 μg/h every 7 days. His self-reported Visual Analogue Scale pain scores decreased from an average of 8/10 to 2/10 or less. Patient's overall function and participation in home activities increased. Buprenorphine is a partial μ-receptor and a κ-δ receptor antagonist known to block NMDA receptors and reduce hyperalgesia secondary to central sensitization.(1) Buprenorphine is also a partial agonist at the opioid receptor-like (ORL-1) receptor, which is found to be analgesic and antinociceptive at the level of the spinal cord.(1,2) The difference in analgesic responses between buprenorphine and other opioids may be due to different receptor G protein interactions and/or selective activation of neuronal K(ATP) channels by buprenorphine.(3) Deficient opening of K(ATP) channels has been shown to mediate neuropathic pain(4); therefore, activation of these channels by buprenorphine may contribute to its analgesic effect in neuropathic pain states wherein other opioids fail. More recently, there have been two case reports in which patients with neuropathic pain of different central etiology were successfully treated with buprenorphine.(5) Despite advances in understanding the pathology related to central pain, effective treatment options are limited. Buprenorphine may be an analgesic option for central pain management when opioids fail to reduce hypersensitivity or when patients exhibit intolerable side effects to other medications.",{},,Journal of opioid management,10.5055/jom.2012.0141,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

There were also extensive recent intracerebral haemorrhages most likely secondary to thrombolysis. Furthermore, the histological examination revealed severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy associated with granulomatous inflammatory reaction, consistent with ABRA. Presentation of ABRA in a middle-aged patient highlighted the difficulties in recognition and management of this rare condition. There is emerging evidence that patients with CAA may have increased risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhages following thrombolysis. This may be further increased by a coexisting CAA-related inflammatory vasculopathy which is potentially treatable with steroid therapy if early diagnosis is made.","DictElement({'Year': '2022', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2022,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-022-03029-x,PMC9783436,Amyloid-β; Amyloid-β-related angiitis; Case report; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Intracerebral haemorrhage; Thrombolysis,Review; Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

The efficacy of SCS in case of central poststroke pain (CPSP), especially thalamic pain, has not been adequately proven. The efficacy of SCS as an extracranial neurostimulation method for the management of central pain syndrome was investigated. In this study, relevant pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures for central pain management were reviewed. A case of successful SCS for thalamic pain after ischemic insult is presented. Explanatory approaches of pathophysiological processes and a review of the current literature underline our results. In the case presented, SCS was found effective in the treatment of thalamic pain. The efficacy of SCS might be caused by segmental and supraspinal processes and collaboration of activating and inhibiting pathways. The integrity of the spinothalamic tract is mandatory. SCS is a treatment option for central pain syndrome, especially thalamic pain. Comparable studies confirm the potency of this technique.

We diagnosed pancreatic arteriovenous malformation (P-AVM) with acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, in the pancreatic body, endoscopic ultrasonography showed lobularity (honeycombing type) and hyperechoic foci (non-shadowing), which suggests chronic pancreatitis. Acute management was performed with conservative treatment including administration of replacement fluids and proteolytic enzyme inhibitor. Distal pancreatectomy for P-AVM was performed because P-AVM is associated with acute pancreatitis recurrence, development of portal hypertension, progression of chronic pancreatitis, and refractory duodenal bleeding. Histological findings on the resected specimens revealed the anastomosis of abnormal arteries and veins, which suggested P-AVM. In addition, inflammation accompanied by fat necrosis due to ischemic infarction in the pancreatic tail, which suggested acute pancreatitis, and mild fibrosis in the pancreatic body, which suggested chronic pancreatitis, were shown.

HO around the hip joint causes a reduction in the functional ability of patients by generating pain and limiting range of motion (ROM). In addition, it results in impaired mobility, ultimately affecting quality of life and increasing the mortality of patients. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating soft tissue inflammation and has been used to reduce patients' pain in HO. However, almost none of the studies reported degradation in the size of HO on images obtained before and after ESWT application. We report a case of a 36-year-old man who developed HO around both hip joints 3 months after bilateral pontine hemorrhage. Seven months after HO development, ESWT was administered to the area of HO every other day for a total of 10 sessions. Immediately following treatment, the ROM of both hip joints increased. Thus the patient was able to maintain a sitting posture without having to be bound to the wheelchair. In addition, the tolerable sitting time before groaning increased from less than ten minutes to almost 60 minutes by the end of all ESWT sessions. Unlike other previous reports, a diminished HO size was confirmed by comparing plain X-rays and bone scans obtained before and after treatment sessions. In this case, we report an objective size reduction in HO in radiologic findings after applying ESWT to both hips. ESWT is a safe, easy-to-apply, and noninvasive modality. We would like to emphasize the use of ESWT as a treatment option for HO to decrease the extent of HO, as well as to improve pain, spasticity and function in patients with stroke.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000031628,PMC9622580,,Review; Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

AVMs are associated with serious complications such as intracranial haemorrhage (2-4% a year, 16% and 29% at 10 and 20 years after diagnosis), seizures (10-30%), focal neurologic deficits, and headaches. The management options are surveillance, endovascular embolization, microsurgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In SRS Stereotactically focused high energy beams of photons induce progressive thrombosis by fibro-intimal hyperplasia and subsequent luminal obliteration.

Cyst formation is reported in about 1.2 % of patients undergoing SRS. While the exact mechanism of post SRS cyst formation is unclear, it is hypothesized that it might be due to damage to the blood brain barrier and increased vessel wall permeability. Delayed cyst formation is reported with latency period between 3 and 10 years after radiotherapy for treatment of cerebrovascular AVMs. However, cystic formation with longer latency periods (in one case upto 17 years) after radiotherapy for other causes such as nasopharyngeal cancers have been reported.

We present a case of central post-stroke pain associated with dystonia. Both conditions were successfully treated with a single deep brain stimulation (DBS) operation. A 60-year-old female suffered a right posterior cerebral artery stroke following emergent clipping of a ruptured posterior cerebral artery aneurysm resulting in central post-stroke pain. This manifested as delayed left face and hemibody allodynia and hyperesthesia. The patient also developed marked left-sided dystonia. These progressive symptoms were disabling and refractory to conservative management. The patient underwent a single-stage DBS surgery with stereotactic targeting and implantation of two leads. One lead was placed in the right-sided ventral capsule/ventral striatum for treatment of pain and a second lead in the right-sided globus pallidus interna for treatment of dystonia. The surgical implantation proceeded without complication. The patient's dystonia markedly improved following surgery. While her pain improved, she required multiple, meticulous programing sessions to achieve significant pain relief and decrease in pain medication use. Overall, the patient was satisfied with the results of her intervention. She did, however, have occasional intermittent spells of severe pain on top of her residual discomfort throughout her treatment course. Unfortunately, she died from small cell lung carcinoma a year after her DBS surgery. Deep brain stimulation targeting multiple brain networks in one operation is feasible and safe.

The use of such products remains popular among American youth as a whole, but is especially high among active duty service members. Supplements are minimally regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and unlike pharmaceuticals, supplements are often brought to market without any testing to show neither efficacy nor safety. Several case reports have documented serious adverse events and raise the question of whether supplement use was a causative factor. Reported events occurring after use of pre-workout supplements include, among others, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, hepatitis, and death. Here, we present the case of a healthy 25-year-old active duty male who experienced a bilateral cerebellar hemorrhagic stroke occurring shortly after taking a supplement named Animal Rage XL. Hemorrhagic stroke occurring in a healthy 25-year-old male with no risk factors is exceedingly rare. This is the first known case of stroke temporally associated with this particular supplement, which is currently available for purchase at military exchanges.

Due to the unusual location of hemorrhage, magnetic resonance venography was performed, revealing absence of venous flow over the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses suggestive of CVT. He received anticoagulant therapy for 6 months and the headache subsided. We feel that a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose an intracerebral hemorrhage in an uncommon site caused by CVT, even if risk factors of CVT are not present, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated as promptly as possible.

34224551,New Horizons for Diagnostic Pitfalls of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis: Clinical Utility of a Newly Developed Cerebral Venous Thrombosis Diagnostic Score: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Khan, Faisal; Seyam, Muhannad; Sharma, Neha; Ud Din, Moin; Bansal, Vivek",Khan,"BACKGROUND Diagnosing cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) poses significant challenges owing to a nonspecific clinical presentation, poorly correlated laboratory biomarkers, and low sensitivity of non-contrast head computed tomography (CT). We describe a case of missed CVT diagnosis, due to low clinical suspicion and nonrecognition of anemia as a prothrombotic factor, especially during an ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. A recently proposed CVT clinical probability score can guide clinicians in pursuing further neurovascular imaging. CASE REPORT A 35-year-old man, with treatment-naive UC, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with new-onset diffuse headache, 4 weeks of bloody diarrhea, and weight loss. Initial ED laboratory studies revealed severe anemia and unremarkable non-contrast head CT. Two days later, the patient returned to the ED for worsening headache. Non-contrast head CT revealed a left temporal hypodensity. This was later confirmed as acute ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MR venogram revealed thrombosis of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, leading to initiation of therapeutic subcutaneous anticoagulation. Repeat MRI, secondary to worsening headache, revealed the development of petechial hemorrhages within the core of venous ischemia in the left temporal lobe. Therapeutic anticoagulation, along with symptomatic management of UC, led to clinical stabilization. CONCLUSIONS CVT should be suspected in patients with UC, especially in the context of anemia, presenting with new-onset or worsening headaches. Recognizing anemia as a thrombogenic factor is crucial. Diagnosis of CVT is challenging due to non-focal symptoms and poorly correlating diagnostic tests. We endorse implementing the CVT clinical probability score into AHA/ASA CVT guidelines to enhance diagnostic accuracy.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '05'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,The American journal of case reports,10.12659/AJCR.932123,PMC8274363,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,United States,eng

She was initially investigated with a CT scan of the brain and lumbar puncture, which yielded no diagnosis. Subsequent MR scan revealed multiple posterior circulation infarcts, along with a previously undiagnosed Arnold-Chiari 2 malformation with an associated syrinx of her cervical and thoracic spine. The infarct involved one of the herniated cerebellar tonsils. Oedema of an infarct in the herniated tonsils caused compression of the medulla at the foramen magnum, with associated neurological symptoms including Lhermitte's phenomenon and headache on valsalva manoeuvre. Owing to these symptoms a surgical decompression was performed.

A subset of patients is even given approval for euthanasia and is without any perspective. Because the anterior cingulate cortex historically seems to be a promising target for patients with both mental and chronic pain disorders, lesioning of this central ""hub"" with cingulotomy may be a useful strategy for medically refractory CPSP. However, limited research is available on cingulotomy for central pain. Hence, we represent a rare case in which cingulotomy is performed on a patient with CPSP. To describe the potential of cingulotomy in a case with CPSP. The case presented in this study concerns a 60-year-old woman who experienced CPSP, caused by a hemorrhagic stroke in the basal ganglia and thalamus. The patient visited several centers and tried multiple off-label treatments; however, she was told nothing else could be done and was even given approval for euthanasia. Hence, anterior cingulotomy was performed. After surgery, no transient adverse events occurred, except for vocabulary disturbances post stroke, which disappeared after several weeks. After 14 weeks, changes in pain behavior were observed, followed by a decreased pain intensity. At a later follow-up, the pain had completely disappeared. Anterior cingulotomy seems to be a suitable ""last-resort"" option for patients with CPSP. Future research, including homogenous groups, to define the best location for lesioning is required to allow the revival of this ""old"" technique in the current era.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,Pain reports,10.1097/PR9.0000000000001149,PMC10962879,ACC; CPSP; Central pain; Cingulotomy; Stroke,Case Reports,United States,eng

It can result from multiple causes; however, TN secondary to stroke is very rare. We present the case of TN secondary to pontine infarction treated with incremental doses of neuropathic pain medication for >5 years before conservative management failed. He was then treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Additionally, we conducted a systematic review using standard PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines for all the cases of TN with brainstem stroke from 1976 to 2022. Our patient was an 82-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a pontine lesion consistent with stroke. The Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score at presentation was 5. He received a marginal dose of 60 Gy to the 80% isodose line in a single fraction to a volume of 0.05 cm<sup>3</sup>. The immediate post-treatment BNI score was 0 and remained at 0 for 3 months, when he experienced recurrence. The recurrence was treated with oxcarbazepine. His pain remained well controlled with a lower dose of oxcarbazepine, and he had no adverse effects at 1 year of follow-up with a BNI score of 3. The systemic review identified 21 case reports with a combined cohort of 25 patients with TN secondary to stroke. Only 3 patients were treated with SRS, 2 of whom reported symptom improvement at 6 months and 8 months of follow-up with no adverse events. Our case and literature review demonstrate durable and effective treatment with SRS, which can be considered a safe and effective treatment option for patients with stroke-associated TN.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2023.08.092,,CyberKnife; Ischemic trigeminal neuralgia; Stereotactic radiosurgery; Trigeminal neuralgia; Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to stroke,Systematic Review; Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
29131117,Significant Hemorrhage Rate Reduction after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery in Symptomatic Cavernous Malformations: Long-Term Outcome in 95 Case Series and Literature Review.,"López-Serrano, Remedios; Martínez, Nuria E; Kusak, M Elena; Quirós, Alicia; Martínez, Roberto",López-Serrano,"The natural history of cavernous malformations (CMs) has remained unclear. This lack of knowledge has made treatment decisions difficult. Indeed, the use of stereotactic radiosurgery is nowadays controversial. The purpose of this paper is to throw light on the effectiveness of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) therapy. The authors reviewed data collected from a prospectively maintained database. A total of 95 patients (57 female and 38 male) underwent GKRS for high-surgical-risk CMs. A total of 76 cavernomas were deeply located (64 lesions in the brainstem and 12 lesions in the thalamus). All of them were located in eloquent regions. The median malformation volume was 1,570 mm3. The median tumor margin dose was 11.87 Gy, and the mean tumor maximum dose was 19.56 Gy. Ninety-five cavernous CMs were managed from 1994 to 2014. All patients had experienced at least 1 symptomatic bleeding incident before treatment (only 1 hemorrhage event in 81%). The median length of follow-up review was 78 months. The pretreatment annual hemorrhage rate was 3.06% compared with 1.4% during the first 3-year latency interval, and 0.16% thereafter (p = 0.004). Four patients developed new location-dependent neurological deficits, and 3 patients had edema-related headache after radiosurgery. All of them presented full recovery. The best dosage range for preventing bleeding was identified as between 11 and 12 Gy in our series. Although the efficacy of radiosurgery in CMs remains impossible to quantify, a very significant reduction in the bleeding rate occurs after a 3-year latency interval. No permanent neurological morbidity is reported in our series. These results defend the safety of GKRS in surgical high-risk CM from the first bleeding event.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,10.1159/000480664,,Adverse radiation effects; Cavernous malformation; Gamma Knife radiosurgery; Hemorrhage rate reduction,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Switzerland,eng

The brainstem includes sensory and motor pathways as well as nuclei of the cranial nerves, and therefore cancer metastasis in the region requires early intervention. Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is commonly employed for the treatment of brain metastasis, it poses risks of late complications like radiation necrosis (RN). RN exacerbates the progression of brain lesions within the irradiated area, and in the brainstem, it can damage multiple nerves, including the superior spinothalamic tract. Central neuropathic pain is often intractable and empirically managed with a combination of conventional drugs, such as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants. However, their efficacy is often limited, leading to a decline in performance status (PS) and quality of life (QOL). We present the case of a 53-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, referred to our palliative care team for managing severe central pain resulting from SRS-related RN in the pons. Despite administration of opioids, including oxycodone and hydromorphone, and adjuvant analgesics, the patient continued to require frequent use of immediate-release opioids. The addition of methadone alone proved successful in achieving optimal pain control. Provided that RN in the brainstem can lead to intractable neuropathic pain, it is advisable to avoid SRS for brainstem metastasis when possible. Add-on methadone should be considered as a viable pain management medication for patients experiencing unresolved central pain.","DictElement({'Year': '2024', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2024,BMC palliative care,10.1186/s12904-024-01547-8,PMC11360288,Brainstem metastasis; Central pain; Methadone; Radiation necrosis; Stereotactic radiosurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

We present a 56-year-old man who suffered from trigeminal neuropathic pain secondary to nerve compression due to a giant posterior fossa AVM. The pain was refractory to drug treatment. From all the therapeutic options available we declined the microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve due to the presence of the giant AVM, or stereotactic radiosurgery because of the AVM´s diffuse nidus. After a multidisciplinary discussion we proposed a minimally invasive, safe and reversible treatment: Motor Cortical Stimulation (MCS). We placed a 16-pole epidural electrode on the right precentral gyrus. The patient had satisfactory pain control with some supplemental medication. No complications or side effects such as seizures, sensory disturbances or infections were presented. The limited choices of intervention of TNP include peripheral nerve stimulation, trigeminal nucleotomy and MCS. Henssen et al performed a systematic review where they investigated the effectiveness of MCS and discovered that this is significantly different among different chronic neuropathic orofacial pain disorders. A visual analogue scale (VAS) measured median pain relief of 66.5% was found.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 29 patients diagnosed with both occipital neuralgia and demyelinating disease by a neurologist from January 2001 to December 2014. We collected data on demographics, clinical findings, presence of C2-3 demyelinating lesions, and treatment responses. The patients with both occipital neuralgia and multiple sclerosis were typically female (76%) and had a later onset (age > 40) of occipital neuralgia (72%). Eighteen patients (64%) had the presence of C2-3 lesions and the majority had unilateral symptoms (83%) or episodic pain (78%). All patients with documented sensory loss (3/3) had C2-3 lesions. Most patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (6/8) had C2-3 lesions. Of the eight patients with C2-3 lesions and imaging at onset of occipital neuralgia, five (62.5%) had evidence of active demyelination. None of the patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (3/3) responded to occipital nerve blocks or high dose intravenous steroids, whereas all of the other phenotypes with long term follow-up (eight patients) had good responses. A cervical spine MRI should be considered in all patients presenting with occipital neuralgia. In patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical features in occipital neuralgia that were predictive of the presence of a C2-3 lesion were unilateral episodic symptoms, sensory loss, later onset of occipital neuralgia, and progressive multiple sclerosis phenotype.

We here review the literature and summarize all anatomical structures related to the pathogenesis of this rare syndrome. We also report two illustrative cases of CM following surgical treatment of Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD; dysplastic gangliocytoma) in two adult patients. LDD is a rare benign cerebellar tumor. Surgical excision appears to be the only effective treatment. However, surgery is hampered by the difficulty to distinguish between tumor and healthy cerebellar tissue, which may result in extensive resection and cause neurological deficits such as CM. A review of the literature and our two cases suggest that lesions or functional impairment of paravermian structures including dentate nuclei, vermis, lateral hemispheres, and cerebellocortical pathways contribute to the development of CM. However, there is no single anatomical structure identified to be associated with CM. It is unknown whether some diseases such as LDD carry a higher risk of postoperative CM than others. As illustrated by our two cases, although there are no special means, optimal preoperative diagnosis might contribute to the prevention of this syndrome. Despite the severity, CM carries a favorable prognosis and generally resolves within a few months.To conclude, we review the clinical signs and particularly the pathophysiological observations and anatomical structures affected in the development of postoperative CM and contribute two cases illustrating the pathogenesis, prognosis, and possible prevention of this syndrome, to focus that CM might also occur in adults even in association with rare tumors.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neurosurgical review,10.1007/s10143-010-0278-1,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity were measured using a region of interest method along the STP. DTT showed normal STP integrities as compared with normal controls. However, the FA values of the left STP at the thalamus were more than 2 SD decreased. The diminished FA value of the left STP in the left thalamus seems to indicate injury of the left ventrolateroposterior nucleus. Central pain and impaired touch sensation of right extremities supports the presence of left STP injury at the ventroposterolateral nucleus in this patient.

We investigated whether her pain could be improved beyond a placebo response by cold caloric vestibular stimulation. She had very little response to two placebo procedures but felt her pain to be markedly lowered in her neck and upper limb by vestibular stimulation. This reduction lasted around 10 days, during which she reported that her pain in these areas was the lowest they had been for years. Her pattern of pain relief is very similar to that reported by patients with central pain arising after thalamic stroke who have reported relief from vestibular stimulation. On the basis of thermosensory disinhibition hypothesis of central pain, we suggest that vestibular stimulation has this beneficial effect because of the intimate anatomical connections between the parieto-insular vestibular cortex and the thermosensory cortex in the dorsal posterior insula.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '03'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Spinal cord,10.1038/sc.2008.47,,,Case Reports; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,England,eng

In the absence of primary sensory deficits, these 6 patients showed a lack of withdrawal and absent or inadequate emotional responses to painful stimuli applied over the entire body, as well as to threatening gestures. Five patients also failed to react to verbal menaces. Patients appeared unconcerned about the defect and seemed unable to learn appropriate escape or protective responses. Common associated abnormalities were rapidly resolving hemiparesis, cortical-type sensory loss, unilateral neglect, and body-schema disorders. Neuroradiological examination disclosed left hemispheric lesions in 4 patients and right hemispheric involvement in 2. Although lesion extension differed, the insular cortex was invariably damaged in all 6 patients. These findings suggest that insular damage may play a critical role in the development of the syndrome by interrupting connections between sensory cortices and the limbic system.",{},,Annals of neurology,10.1002/ana.410240109,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

17183994,Incidence and pattern of headache in cerebral venous thrombosis.,"Ravishankar, Krishnamurthy",Ravishankar,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a challenging condition because of the variability of clinical presentations. CVT can present at all ages, but is seen more in young and middle-aged women. CVT does not necessarily occur only when there is an obvious underlying etiology. In almost 30% of cases, the etiology cannot be established. CVT can present with an acute thunderclap headache, fever, seizures, focal deficits, impaired sensorium, or papilloedema. Headache is known to be the most frequently associated initial complaint, and is present in more than 80% of patients, but it is not always remembered that headache can be the sole presenting complaint of CVT and even when early papilloedema is absent. Headache can occur in isolation in up to 5% of CVT cases. There is no identifiable, uniform, recognizable pattern of headache in CVT, but this article discusses the ""Headache Profile"" that is seen more commonly in this setting with an illustration of one such case where the innocuous headache turned sinister. Magnetic resonance imaging with venography is the investigation of choice to diagnose CVT; computed tomography alone will miss a significant number of cases. One must keep in mind the possibility of CVT in every patient who presents with new-onset headache of any type, any severity, and in any location, particularly when there is worsening in spite of analgesics.

The mechanism of action was presumed to be the suppression of overacting thalamic relay neurons by blockade of low voltage-activated calcium channel or by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. Zonisamide can be one of the therapeutic options for severe CPSP and might provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CPSP.

32750518,Sustainable Effects of 8-Year Intermittent Spinal Cord Stimulation in a Patient with Thalamic Post-Stroke Pain.,"Xu, Wenying; Zhang, Chencheng; Sun, Bomin; Li, Dianyou",Xu,"Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is a central neuropathic pain syndrome secondary to a cerebrovascular accident. CPSP treatment usually begins with medication; however, this is associated with inadequate pain relief and adverse effects. Neurostimulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have been developed for improved pain relief. We report a patient with thalamic pain who underwent 8-year cervical SCS in an intermittent mode. A 71-year-old man presented with left thalamic stroke that caused persistent allodynia and ""pricking"" sensations at right-side extremities. The pain did not respond well to several pain therapies, including medication, acupuncture, and nerve-blocking anesthesia. Subsequently, the severe and refractory pain caused dystonia in his right hand and seriously hindered recovery and rehabilitation of stroke sequelae. Further, the pain induced depression and severe anxiety mood status and had an effect on his functional activities of life. After SCS device implantation, the patient received intermittent stimulation with 90 minutes on/30 minutes off. A significant decrease in the patient's pain was observed with no serious side effects. After subtle programming of the implantable pulse generator, a significant improvement of his dystonia and affective mood was observed. Intermittent SCS allowed for persistent stimulation for 8 years. Taken together, this intervention allowed for an acceptable improvement of his functional quality of life. Our findings indicate that SCS is safe and efficacious for CPSP, including thalamic stroke pain. Long-term intermittent stimulation can preserve implantable pulse generator battery life and achieve sustained improvement of a patient's pain, movement, and affective mood status.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.195,,Central post-stroke pain; Intermittent stimulation; Spinal cord stimulation; Thalamic pain,Case Reports,United States,eng

Most cases are fatal within one week from onset. AHL pathology varies with the acuteness of disease. Hemorrhages, vessel fibrinoid necrosis, perivascular fibrin exudation, edema and neutrophilic inflammation are early features, while perivascular demyelination, microglial foci and myelin-laden macrophages appear later. Reactive astrocytosis is not present in early hemorrhagic non-demyelinated lesions, but is seen in older lesions. This case report presents the pathology of an AHL case with fulminant course and fatal outcome within 48 hours from presentation. Severe hemorrhages, edema and neutrophilic inflammation in the absence of circumscribed perivascular demyelination affected the temporal neocortex and white matter, hippocampus, cerebellar cortex and white matter, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, brainstem, cranial nerve roots and leptomeninges. Perivascular end-feet and parenchymal processes of astrocytes exhibited impressive swelling in haemorrhagic but non-demyelinated white matter regions. Astrocytes were dystrophic and displayed degenerating processes. Astrocytic swellings and remnants were immunoreactive for aquaporin-4, aquaporin-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These morphological changes of astrocytes consistent with injury were also observed in haemorrhagic and normal appearing cortex. Our findings reinforce that perivascular demyelination is not present early in AHL. This is the first study that highlights the early and widespread astrocytic injury in the absence of demyelination in AHL, suggesting that, similarly to neuromyelitis optica and central pontine myelinolysis, demyelination in AHL is secondary to astrocyte injury.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Acta neuropathologica communications,10.1186/2051-5960-2-52,PMC4035095,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A 19-year-old man was brought to our clinic with complaints of fever, headache, fatigue, and left lower quadrant pain that had persisted for 3 weeks. On physical examination, painful cervical lymphadenopathies were observed. Meningitis was suspected based on a cerebrospinal fluid examination, and left-sided orchitis was diagnosed based on findings from magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. However, neither antibiotics nor antiviral drugs were effective in treating the patient's symptoms. On the 20<sup>th</sup> day of hospitalization, the patient experienced a loss of consciousness, and brain T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical, high-signal intensities in both basal nuclei and the left temporal lobe.

A left cervical lymph node biopsy showed apoptotic necrosis in paracortical and cortical areas with an abundance of macrophages and large lymphoid cells, which had irregular nuclei suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease; the pathological findings from a brain biopsy were the same as those of the cervical lymph node biopsy. The encephalitis and cervical lymphadenopathies followed a benign course, as did the testitis.

One year poststroke, severe right-sided facial, scalp, arm, and trunk pain developed and was exacerbated by any tactile contact. Medical treatment had failed. Medical illness, including mandatory anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation, precluded surgical procedures. Minimally invasive radiosurgery was offered as an alternative. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were used to localize the left CMN. A single shot of 140 Gy was delivered to the 100% isodose line by using the 4-mm collimator helmet. The patient was evaluated at regular intervals. By 12 weeks posttreatment, he had significant improvements in pain control and his ability to tolerate physical contact during activities of daily living. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated baseline encephalomalacia from his prior stroke, and signal changes in the left CMN consistent with gamma irradiation-based thalamotomy. Currently, nearly 7 years after radiosurgery, he continues to enjoy a marked reduction in pain without the need of analgesic medications. Thalamic pain syndrome is generally refractory to conventional treatment. Neurosurgical interventions provide modest benefit and carry associated risks of invasive surgery and anesthesia.

18444223,Primary cerebral rhabdomyosarcoma presenting as haemorrhagic stroke.,"Grebe, H P; Steube, D",Grebe,"Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) occurs mostly in the context of arterial hypertension, with typical localisations. Tumour-associated bleeding is the cause of 6-10% of ICHs, mostly from metastases. We present the case of a 40-year-old female admitted originally for neck pain of sudden onset, accompanied by nausea and marked right arm paresis. A CT-scan revealed left fronto-central cortico-subcortical haemorrhage. Cerebral angiography was normal. Two months after the initial event the residual paresis worsened and the patient developed neuropsychological deficits. A CT-scan showed oedema around the original bleeding site, on MRI a solid lesion with a diameter of 5 cm could be seen, with some cystic alterations and contact to the meninges. The tumour was surgically removed, and removal at the time was considered complete. Histological analysis proved it to be an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's neurological deficits gradually improved. Almost three months after the operation she complained of intense left-sided headache. On CT a hyperdense left fronto-central lesion with positive enhancement could be seen; MRI confirmed a relapse tumour and showed bleeding in the rostral portion of the tumour as well as oedema. The patient started radiation therapy with a total dose of 60 Gy. Whole body image studies at the time failed to reveal any other neoplastic lesions. Two months later a CT-scan showed continued tumour growth. We present this case as a rare aetiology of intracerebral haemorrhage, more frequently associated with arterial hypertension or vascular pathology, as well as being an unusual manifestation of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, rarely found in the brain. The case also serves to illustrate the importance of a thorough diagnosis including MRI imaging in patients with so-called atypical ICH.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Zentralblatt fur Neurochirurgie,10.1055/s-2007-1004581,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

A 32-year-old male presented with recurrent transient motor aphasia and headache in the left fronto-temporal region for three years. The symptoms usually lasted for one hour. Brain computed tomography (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance imaging using gradient recalled echo showed a prominent penetrating vein at the left frontal periventricular region. Brain CT perfusion imaging performed during the symptoms revealed increased perfusion in the corresponding area with relatively decreased perfusion in the left fronto-temporal cortices. Digital subtraction angiography revealed collecting venous blood from the left septal and thalamostriate veins draining into the left cavernous sinus without early arteriovenous shunting. In this patient, an inciting incident might have led to imbalance of the venous flow surrounding the DVA, causing venous hypertension and the intracerebral steal phenomenon in the surrounding area.

Although diverse etiologies have been reported to cause central pain, there are few reports on the occurrence and surgical treatment of central pain following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper describes the occurrence of central pain following a severe TBI, in which the diagnosis of central pain was typically delayed due to the patient's decreased ability to express his pain for severe aphasia as a neurological sequela. The severe burning pain, deep pressure-like pain, and deep mechanical allodynia, which presented over the contralateral side to the TBI, were successfully relieved with motor cortex stimulation (MCS). The analgesic effect of stimulation was found to be long lasting and was still present at the 12-month follow up.

Up to 10% of acute CVAs in young patients are caused by dissection of the vertebral or carotid artery. Wallenberg syndrome results from a CVA in the vertebral or posterior inferior artery of the cerebellum and manifests as various degrees of cerebellar dysfunction. The administration of a thrombolytic medication has been recommended in the treatment of patients with stroke caused by cervical artery dissection. Surprisingly, there is scant literature on the use of this medication in the treatment of this condition. We describe a 42-year-old man with the sudden onset of headache, left-sided neck pain, vomiting, nystagmus, and ataxia 1 h after completing a weightlifting routine. Computed tomography angiography revealed a grade IV left vertebral artery injury with a dissection flap extending distally and resulting in complete occlusion. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated acute left cerebellar and lateral medullary infarcts, consistent with Wallenberg syndrome. The patient was treated with tissue plasminogen activator, which failed to resolve his symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians frequently manage patients with acute CVAs. For select patients, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator can improve outcomes. However, the risk of major hemorrhage with this medication is significant. Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of acute stroke in young patients and is often missed on initial presentation. It is imperative for the emergency physician to consider acute cervical artery dissection as a cause of stroke and to be knowledgeable regarding the efficacy of thrombolytic medications for this condition.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2017.01.025,,Wallenberg syndrome; ischemic stroke; vertebral artery dissection,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

However, it is not known if tDCS delivered via dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can be used to ameliorate both symptoms. The purpose of this case report was to share the effectiveness of using tDCS of the DLPFC with short inter-session intervals to reduce central pain and depression in a stroke survivor. A 45-year-old patient presented with CPSP and depression following a stroke. The CPSP and depression were diagnosed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questionnaire (DN4Q) and the Beck Depression Index (BDI) respectively. The pain score was 10 on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and it was a hemi-body burning sensation, with a score of 7 on DN4Q, and the depression score was 25 on the BDI. The patient received anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC using two different application protocols. Initially, a stimulation session of 2 milliamperes (mA) intensity for 20 minutes was given every working day for 2 weeks. After 3 weeks, she then received 7 daily sessions of periodic stimulations of 2 mA intensity for 13 minutes each with 20 minutes inter-session intervals for 1 week. The patient was followed up for 6 months post-intervention. Immediately following the last session of the initial protocol of stimulation, the BDI score reduced from 25 to 7 and the pain became abolished. However, the symptoms relapsed at 3 weeks post-intervention to the initial BDI score of 25, VAS score of 10 and DN4Q score of 7. Following the application of the second protocol of stimulation, the BDI score improved to 18 at three weeks and later to 7 at six months post-intervention while the pain (both VAS and DN4Q) became completely abolished. Further research is needed to determine if a series of periodic tDCS with short-intersession intervals applied to the DLPFC may be more effective than a single tDCS with long inter-session intervals, in decreasing pain and inducing long-term improvement in mood in people with stroke.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '03', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Physiotherapy theory and practice,10.1080/09593985.2021.1891591,,Transcranial direct current stimulation; central post-stroke pain; long-term potentiation; noninvasive brain stimulation; post-stroke depression,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

29794278,A case report of a thalamic stroke associated with sudden disappearance of severe chronic low back pain.,"Shanthanna, Harsha",Shanthanna,"Chronic pain conditions are associated with neuroplasticity within the central nervous system. In most patients the maladaptive consequence of neuroplasticity supports prolonged course of chronic pain, despite the absence of a commensurate etiology. From a pain neuromatrix perspective it can involve three different circuits within the central nervous system; the classical sensory pathway, the limbic system pathway, and the associative pathways involving the parietal cortical connections. Although this can be conceptualized as a fluid system composed of several interacting networks, it can be broadly separated into a nociceptive specific network of spino-thalamic neurons and second order neurons beyond thalamus that are not nociceptor specific. Thalamus acts as an important relay station that conveys nociceptive signaling to higher centres. Neuroplastic changes can potentially involve any parts within this neuromatrix. It is very uncommon to observe the sudden disappearance of such a chronic pain condition. In this case report, the author describes the clinical course of a patient with severe chronic low back pain (CLBP), whose pain suddenly disappeared after a stroke involving his left thalamus. Although extremely rare, existing case reports of such disappearance of pain with a secondary stroke in patients suffering from central post stroke pain (CPSP) are reviewed. The author further postulates hypotheses that could potentially explain this phenomenon based on the existing knowledge. Although extremely rare and unpredictable, a thalamic stroke involving areas that are involved in chronic pain signaling can potentially lead to disappearence of an existing chronic pain condition. This is the first case report of such sudden disappearence of CLBP with well established nociceptive pathology supported by clinical and imaging findings. This unique case report could potentially generate ideas for future research and clinical treatment in the field of neuromodulation and brain stimulation.",{},,Scandinavian journal of pain,10.1515/sjpain-2017-0169,,deep brain stimulation; neuromodulation; neuroplasticity; post-stroke pain; thalamic pain; thalamic stroke,Case Reports,Germany,eng

Herein, we present the use of the telovelar approach to access a choroid plexus papilloma within the right foramen of Luschka. A 28-year-old female presented with a history of sudden onset pulsatile headache and syncope twice without prodrome. The brain MRI revealed a 4th ventricular tumor deviated to the right foramen of Luschka and extending to the CP angle, 2.2 cm in diameter. There was no secondary hydrocephalus due to the patent foramen of Magendie and left foramen of Luschka. The patient underwent suboccipital craniotomy and C1 laminectomy with a telovelar approach. The right tonsil was elevated and teal chloride was incised from the foramen of Magendie to the telovelar junction. The tumor was centrally decompressed, and the margin was gently dissected from the brainstem and cerebellum peduncles. Functions of the facial, cochlear, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and hypoglossal nerves and nuclei were monitored. Mapping of the facial nucleus, ambiguous nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus was also done.

9490897,[A case of post-hemiplegic painful dystonia following thalamic infarction with good response to botulinus toxin].,"Motoi, Y; Hattori, Y; Miwa, H; Shina, K; Mizuno, Y",Motoi,"We report a 67-year-old hypertensive right-handed woman who developed severe pain and dystonia in her left upper and lower extremity after a thalamic infarction. She was well until 9 months prior to the present admission to our hospital, when she had an acute onset of left hemiparesis which turned out to have been caused by a thalamic infarct. Her hemiparesis showed nearly complete recovery during the next four months. She noted an onset of severe spontaneous pain and difficulty in using her left hand four months prior to the present admission. Neurologic examination on admission revealed an alert and well oriented Japanese woman. Cranial nerves were intact. Although she did not have weakness, her left hand showed thalamic posture, and upon standing, she showed a dystonic posture in which her left forearm took pronation and flexion at the elbow joint and her left lower extremity took extension in the knee joint and planter flexion in the ankle joint. Her dystonic posture increased during walking and disappeared in the supine position. She complained of severe spontaneous pain and tingling sensation in her left extremities. Position sense was diminished in her left leg. However other sensations were intact. She had slight ataxia on the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetric, but the planter response was extensor on the left side. MRI revealed a small lacunar infarct involving the right posterolateral thalamic region. EMG with surface electrodes revealed non-reciprocal tonic discharges in the left biceps brachii and forearm flexor and extensor muscles. She responded poorly to various medications. Only trihexyphenidyl showed partial alleviation of her pain and dystonic posture. We thought her pain might be caused by dystonic contraction of the skeletal muscles, at least in part. We injected 25 IU of botulinus toxin as a total dose into her biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and wrist flexor muscles. A few days after the injection, her dystonic posture began to show marked improvement; as her dystonia improved, her pain also showed marked improvement. This patient appeared to represent a case of post-hemiplegic dystonia. Her pain was initially thought to be the thalamic pain. However, as her pain disappeared with improvement of her dystonia, her pain is most likely to have been caused by the dystonic muscle contraction. Botulinus toxin treatment appears to be useful for post-hemiplegic painful dystonia.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

A patient developed lateral medullary infarction, which produced contralateral spinothalamic sensory deficits and subsequent CPSP. The CPSP gradually improved until the development of ipsilateral medial medullary infarction 26 months later, which was associated with mild hemiparesis and lemniscal sensory deficits. The ipsilateral medial medullary infarction immediately aggravated the CPSP to its previous level. This observation has implications regarding the pathogenesis of CPSP. CPSP may be related to hyperexcitation of the spinothalamic pathway by the reticulothalamic system, which in turn is modulated by the medial lemniscus pathway.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '04'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,European neurology,10.1159/000102165,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Switzerland,eng

Blood adenohypophyseal hormones and electroencephalogram did not reveal an abnormality in the ictus. Neuroimaging and clinical studies did not support involvement of the thalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus or regional structure. Therefore, episodic pain may be an isolated manifestation with a pontine lesion.

The cerebrovascular lesions were located in the lower brain-stem in 8 patients, involved the thalamus in 9 and in 6 were suprathalamic. In 4 patients the location of the CVL could not be determined. All patients had abnormal temperature and pain sensibility, with a severe deficit in most cases. All except 2 had raised thresholds to thermal pain and all except 1 had abnormal sensibility to pin-prick. Eighty-eight percent exhibited hyperpathia with combined loss and suprathreshold exaggeration of somatic sensibility. In 85% somatic stimuli evoked dysaesthesia and about half of these patients also experienced spontaneous dysaesthesia. Paraesthesias were reported by 41%, radiation of stimuli by 50%, after-sensations by 45% and allodynia by 23%. Vibration sensibility was abnormal in 41%; raised thresholds to the perception of touch were found in 52%, to 2-PD in 35%, to dermolexia in 45% and to joint movements in 37%. The results indicate that all patients with CPSP have lesions that affect the major pathways for temperature and pain sensibility, i.e., the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways. Furthermore it appears that neither the level of the lesion along the neuraxis nor concomitant injury to the medial lemniscal pathways is crucial for the development of CPSP. The results confirm the notion that CPSP is a deafferentation syndrome, but they also provide evidence against the hypothesis that CPSP is a release phenomenon caused by a lesion that removes inhibitory influences of the lemniscal pathways on neurones that evoke pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(89)90128-0,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

Several such patients have also noted that it reduces tactile allodynia, an especially ill-understood phenomenon in these patients. The first aim is to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study neural activity associated with tactile allodynia in central post-stroke pain (CPSP). The second is to assess how this would be affected, if at all, by CVS. The third is to assess the ability of the VESTAL solution for MEG to detect anterior cingulate activation. A 58-year-old woman with CPSP, and marked unilateral tactile allodynia, participated in a MEG study with imaging pre- and post-CVS. Tactile simulation within the patient's allodynic area resulted in contralateral activation of the primary motor and anterior cingulate cortices, which had normalized 24 h post-CVS. We suggest that the unexpected primary motor cortex activation in response to light touch in the allodynic area arises from inappropriate activation of a normal mechanism, which may occur when a threat to homeostasis is present, to lower motor thresholds and allow for more rapid performance of corrective actions. We propose this may be mediated by the interoceptive cortex in the dorsal posterior insula.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '06'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Acta neurologica Scandinavica,10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01106.x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Denmark,eng

Several studies using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) have demonstrated that injury of the spinothalamic tract (STT) is a pathogenetic mechanism of central pain following TBI. However, no study of headache due to injury of the STT has been reported. Patient 1 was a 52-year-old female who suffered head trauma resulting from an in-car traffic crash. While sitting in a passenger seat in a moving vehicle, another vehicle suddenly hit the car from the right side. Her head hit the door and she suffered a flexion-hyperextension-rotation injury. She began to feel headaches in both fronto-parieto-occipital areas approximately 2 weeks after the crash. The characteristics and severity of pain were as follows: constant tingling and intermittent stabbing pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia (visual analogue scale score: 7). Patient 2 was a 50-year-old male who suffered head trauma from a flexion-hyperextension injury that occurred after being hit from behind by a vehicle while driving his car. He began to feel headache in both fronto-parieto-occipital areas the day after the crash: constant tingling pain without allodynia or hyperalgesia (visual analogue scale score: 6). The patient 1 was diagnosed as mild TBI due to head flexion-hyperextension-rotation injury. The patient 2 was diagnosed as mild TBI due to head flexion-hyperextension injury. Clinical assessment and DTT were performed at 5 months (patient 1) and 10 months (patient 2) after the initial injury. On DTTs of patient 1 and 2, the STTs showed narrowing in both hemispheres. In addition, discontinuations at the subcortical white matter were observed in both hemispheres in patient 2. Headache due to injury of the STT was diagnosed in patients with mild TBI. Precise diagnosis of central pain from other types of pain is clinically important because the management of central pain is quite different from those for other types of pain. Our results suggest that headache might be ascribed to the injury of the STT in patients with mild TBI. Therefore, we recommend evaluation of the STT using DTT in patients with mild TBI who complain of headache having the characteristics of neuropathic pain.",{},,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000014306,PMC6380840,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

The authors report the use of motor cortex stimulation to alleviate 3 distinct conditions associated with intractable facial pain: trigeminal deafferentation pain following rhizotomy, deafferentation pain secondary to meningioma, and postherpetic neuralgia. Functional MR imaging was used to localize facial areas on the precentral gyrus prior to surgery. All 3 patients experienced long-lasting complete or near-complete resolution of pain following electrode implantation. Efficacy in pain reduction was achieved through variation of stimulation settings over the course of treatment, and it was assessed using the visual analog scale and narrative report.

In patients after a stroke, a similar but rarely occurring phenomenon consisting of the patient experiencing the presence of an additional limb has been described. This phenomenon, generally called supernumerary phantom limb (SPL), may be caused by lesions in the right or left cerebral hemisphere, but has been predominantly reported in patients who have had a right hemispheric stroke. We report two cases of atypical SPL and phantom limb pain (PLP) after pontine hemorrhage. The patients were treated conservatively and their symptoms lasted more than 1 month. This is the first report of SPLs after left pontine hemorrhage, and phantom perception and pain lasted longer than those in previously observed cases. Our results indicate that SPL may be more common than reported; therefore, thorough examinations are essential for the care of stroke patients.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Journal of Korean medical science,10.3346/jkms.2011.26.6.844,PMC3102884,Phantom Limb Pain; Stroke; Supernumerary Phantom Limb,Case Reports; Journal Article,Korea (South),eng

Even though they are known complications of surgically treated intracerebral haemorrhages (ICH), the presence of a brain abscess at the site of an untreated ICH is a rare event. Such cases may result from haematogenous spread from distant foci or contiguous sites and are often preceded by episodes of sepsis and local infection. Immunodeficiency, AIDS, age, diabetes mellitus and vitamin-K deficiency are predisposing factors. Abscess formation should be considered in case of clinical deterioration, headache, and any neurological deficit after febrile episodes. Early diagnosis with neuroradiological imaging, infection blood markers and microbiological identification of the causative pathogen is crucial for treatment with surgical drainage or excision and specific antibiotic therapy, which guarantee good outcome and long-term survival. In fact, while prompt diagnosis and treatment guarantee good outcome and long-term survival, morbidity and mortality are very high in case of misdiagnosis.

One month later, she became aware of repeated numbness that started in the right hand and spread to the right half of the body and lower limbs and continued for repeated periods of approximately 20-30 min. Neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings except for orthostatic headache. Electroencephalography showed no epileptic discharge. Head MRI revealed left convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) restricted to the prefrontal sulcus, left frontal cerebral venous thrombosis, diffuse dural thickening with gadolinium enhancement, and subdural hematoma in the posterior cranial fossa. Spinal MRI revealed epidural fluid accumulation around the thoracic spine. CT myelography revealed cerebrospinal fluid leakages at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae levels. The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), which was treated effectively with a blood patch. In this case, cSAH may have resulted from rupturing of the vessel wall as a result of cortical venous thrombosis induced by SIH. The repeated transient neurologic symptoms suggesting migraine aura may have originated from cSAH, which in turn led to cortical spreading depression.

Whilst characteristic signs of a unilateral forebrain lesion were observed, the dominant and striking finding was a right-sided hemisensory disturbance characterised by hyperaesthesia and hyperresponsiveness. Necropsy revealed a gelatinous mass confined to the right forebrain that was identified histologically as an oligodendroglioma. The lesion was centred on the internal capsule and involved ventral frontal and temporal lobes and the ventrolateral thalamus, including lateral and medial parts of the ventrocaudal nuclear region (ventrobasilar complex) of the thalamus. On clinical and neuroanatomical grounds, the case exhibited features in common with central pain syndrome in human patients with thalamic lesions. These included a somatosensory disorder of hyperaesthesia affecting an entire side of the head and body, behavioural manifestations consistent with spontaneous pain and a lesion involving the ventrobasilar complex. Of interest, the hemisensory abnormality was ipsilateral to the lesion, contrasting with central pain in humans, in which clinical signs are contralateral to analogous lesions. It is suggested that species-specific differences in spinal cord organisation of pain pathways, particularly the greater bilateral projection of nociceptive afferents to thalamic relay nuclei in carnivores, may account for this disparity. Notably, central pain is rare in human patients with brain tumours, even those affecting the thalamus, and this may also be the case in dogs.",{},,Australian veterinary journal,10.1111/j.1751-0813.2000.tb10402.x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This is, perhaps, the first described case where low dose amitriptyline has been shown to relieve the thalamic pain syndrome in a chemically dependent person.",{},,Journal of addictive diseases,10.1300/J069v10n03_09,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
19409009,Endovascular occlusion of a ruptured transitional aneurysm associated with a developmental venous anomaly. Case report.,"Ducruet, Andrew F; Kellner, Christopher P; Connolly, E Sander; Meyers, Philip M",Ducruet,"Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) represent a rare cause of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This case demonstrates an unusual DVA associated with venous hypertension, arteriovenous shunting, and a ruptured transitional aneurysm. The authors describe the first use of embolization as a treatment method for an unstable ruptured transitional aneurysm associated with a DVA. This 33-year-old man suffered acute onset of headache, gait ataxia, and left hemiparesis. Computed tomography brain scans demonstrated a deep paramedian right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. No cavernous malformation was apparent on MR imaging. Diagnostic angiography revealed arteriovenous shunting from the right anterior and middle cerebral arteries to a large DVA with an associated arteriovenous fistula, with a 3-mm aneurysm in the transition from pericallosal artery to the collecting vein. Both surgical and endovascular treatment options were considered. The patient underwent repeat angiography on hospital Day 7, at which time the aneurysm had increased to 5 mm, and endovascular treatment was selected. Acrylic occlusion of the aneurysm was performed and confirmed angiographically. The patient's neurological symptoms resolved throughout the hospital stay, and he remains symptom free in the 10 months since treatment. Developmental venous anomalies are not usually associated with arteriovenous shunting and aneurysms as a source of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Endovascular occlusion of the aneurysm without blockage of physiologically necessary venous structures is a possible method of treatment for this complex mixed vascular lesion, and has proven safe and effective in this patient. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first presentation of this situation in the literature.",{},,Neurosurgical focus,10.3171/2009.1.FOCUS08291,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Here we present a case of a 65-year-old male with complaints of left arm pain and allodynia (specifically light touch to any part of the left arm produced significant discomfort) who was found to have a right parietal lobe intraparenchymal bleed after smoking crack cocaine. Acute central pain is mainly associated with parietal, thalamic, and brainstem lesions. It has been proposed that acute limb pain from a parietal lobe stroke is due to the disconnection of the parietal cortex from the thalamus secondary to the interruption of the pathways between the hemisphere and thalamus/basal ganglia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Case reports in neurological medicine,10.1155/2018/9598675,PMC6000842,,Case Reports,United States,eng

A 29-year-old male patient with head trauma resulting from a pedestrian car accident presented with pain in multiple areas (both subscapular areas, posterior head and neck, both upper trapezius areas, and the right arm and leg). His pain had not improved with various types of conservative management. Evaluations (conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, and whole spine magnetic resonance imaging), performed 2 years after the head trauma, did not reveal any specific abnormality. Fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome were ruled out by physical examination. Injuries of the spinothalamic tracts in both hemispheres were observed on diffusion tensor imaging in terms of the configuration (thinning) and diffusion tensor tractography parameters (decreased fractional anisotropy or tract volume). Some of the pain in the trunk and extremities in this patient could be ascribed to central pain caused by injury of both spinothalamic tracts. We conclude that diffusion tensor tractography provides a useful means of detecting injury of the spinothalamic tract in patients with traumatic brain injury.",{},,Journal of rehabilitation medicine,10.2340/16501977-1783,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Sweden,eng
16733356,Somatic sensation and the insular-opercular cortex: relationship to central pain.,"Bowsher, David",Bowsher,"We report 5 stroke patients with lesions affecting the insula and parietal operculum sparing the postcentral gyrus (somatosensory cortical area SI); 3 had spontaneous central poststroke pain (CPSP) and 2 did not. All were imaged and underwent quantitative sensory threshold tests, though not all modalities were tested in all subjects. Tactile thresholds were unaltered in all. The patients with CPSP exhibited greatly elevated thresholds for mechanical pain (skinfold pinch), sharpness and thermal sensations; the pain-free patients had distinctly lesser elevations of their skinfold pinch and innocuous and noxious thermal thresholds, and no sharpness deficit. It is therefore suggested that, in the case of similar cortical lesions, the presence or absence of spontaneous pain either modifies the thresholds for some innocuous modalities, or that the degree of deficit of some innocuous modalities determines whether or not central pain occurs.","DictElement({'Year': '2006', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '29'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2006,European neurology,10.1159/000093575,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng
9272783,A longitudinal study of somesthetic perceptual disorders in an individual with a unilateral thalamic lesion.,"Greenspan, J D; Joy, S E; McGillis, S L; Checkosky, C M; Bolanowski, S J",Greenspan,"Several aspects of tactile, thermal and pain perception were evaluated in an individual (R.S.) with a hemorrhagic lesion centered in her left lateral thalamus. Over a 4-year period, psychophysical evaluations were undertaken every 6-8 months, and five magnetic resonance (MR) studies were conducted. Early tests (1991-1992) revealed large contralateral deficits in R.S.'s perception of touch, innocuous temperature, and mechanically evoked cutaneous pain--more so for the upper versus the lower extremity. R.S. showed a similar pattern for heat pain sensitivity, but a more modest deficit than for mechanically evoked pain. She showed a deficit for cold pain sensitivity on her foot, but not for her hand. Thresholds for all types of stimuli ipsilateral to the lesion were within a normative range. Late in 1993, R.S. demonstrated improvements in sensory capacity for touch and mechanically evoked pain contralaterally, although deficits were still evident. During the same period, heat pain sensitivity improved contralaterally, and strikingly, a permanent, ipsilateral hypersensitivity to heat pain developed in her hand. Throughout the entire testing period, R.S.'s ratings of perceived unpleasantness matched the patterns of perceived pain intensity. Thus, the discriminative and the affective dimensions of her pain would change in tandem. However, perceptible innocuous thermal stimuli evoked no affective response when applied contralaterally, despite being described as pleasant when presented ipsilaterally. Throughout the testing period, R.S. reported a persistent numbness on her right hemi-body. Only during a 3-month period in 1995 did she experience spontaneous pain, which was referred to her right foot. The only change in psychophysical performance related to her right foot was a transient but intense thermal allodynia several months prior to her spontaneous pain. The MR studies over this 4-year period showed changes in the extent of edema, gliosis and/or ischemia that could be related to perceptual changes. Thus, the conspicuous observations in this thalamic lesion case were: (i) differential effects upon the various pain modalities (mechanical, heat and cold); (ii) development of thermal allodynia without mechanical allodynia, including an ipsilateral effect; (iii) a deficit in positive affective responses to temperature; and (iv) the different time courses for changes in evoked somesthetic capacity versus spontaneous paresthesias and pathological pain.",{},,Pain,10.1016/s0304-3959(97)03378-2,,,"Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Unfortunately, there are few publications concerning long term follow up of patients with these types of injuries. We present a case of trans-orbital penetrating brain injury with an 18 year follow up. A 43-year-old, previously healthy, male was accidently impaled on a fencing foil resulting in a penetrating brain injury. Initial symptoms included diplopia, ophthalmoparesis, a non-reactive pupil, decreased visual acuity, decreased sensation across the cheek, dysphagia and dysarthria. CT scan taken on presentation showed a clear tract of the foil traversing the various structures of the brain. One week after the trauma, the patient developed a unique constellation of paroxysmal attacks of autonomic dysfunction consisting of profuse diaphoresis and decreased skin temperature on the left side of the body, as well as dilation of the left pupil. Three months after the accident, the patient suddenly experienced severe constant pain affecting the left side of his body associated with thermal and tactile allodynia. On latest follow up, 18 years after the accident, the patient continues to have chronic pain, allodynia, and lack of temperature sensation throughout the left face, arm, and leg. He has a wide based, hemi-ataxic gait, with the left leg swinging out and around. EMG and nerve conduction studies have found no voluntary activity in the temporalis and masseter muscles resulting in atrophy and fibrosis. An MRI shows linear encephalomalacia along the path of the foil extending to the pons, involving the right spinothalamic tract, and cerebellum. Our case illustrates the importance of such a longitudinal follow up. It demonstrates the possible severity of the sequelae from these types of injuries including chronic pain and gait ataxia, as well as EOM and autonomic dysfunction. Due to the potential ongoing needs of such patients, it is important to plan a long-term, team-based approach that centers around physical therapy and improving long term quality of life.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100792,PMC7334582,Autonomic dysfunction; Central pain syndrome; Penetrating brain injury; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports,United States,eng

In addition, the incidence of hemiballismus in acute cerebrovascular diseases is less than 1%. To our knowledge, the association of these 2 clinical conditions has not been previously described. After observing one patient with hemiballismus accompanied by ipsilateral acute limb pain at stroke onset, we retrospectively examined more than 4000 patients in the Lausanne Stroke Registry for hemiballismus-hemichorea occurring together with acute ipsilateral pain. Of the 29 subjects with hemiballismus-hemichorea, the observed patient was the only one to have acute pain at the onset of stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging showed acute infarction in the territory of the right anterior parietal artery, whereas the basal ganglia, thalamus, and subthalamic region were intact. The syndrome of acute limb pain associated with hemiballismus may result from disconnection of the parietal lobe from deeper structures. In contrast with isolated hemiballismus, we suggest that the simultaneous occurrence of this movement disorder with ipsilateral pain is specific for an anterior parietal artery stroke.",{},,Archives of neurology,10.1001/archneur.60.7.1004,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Current incidence of splenic infarction, especially during infectious endocardites as well as diagnostic methods used are poorly specified in the literature. We here report the case of a 26-year old woman with no particular previous history or cardiovascular risk factor who, at the end 14 weeks of amenorrhea, presented to the Emergency Department with febrile syndrome evolving over 10 days and abdominal pain of recent onset at the level of the left hypochondre. Clinical examination showed febrile patient with a temperature of 39.5°C, tenderness of the left hypochondre and panaritium at the level of the palm of the left hand and of the sole of the foot. Gynecological examination was strictly normal. Given this clinical picture, abdominal ultrasound showed mediosplenic anechoic area with hilar apex and with peripheral edges, suggesting splenic infarct. Etiological assessment included echocardiography showing thickened and remodeled oslerian graft on the mitral valve with large valve vegetation and MI grade II. Blood cultures were performed during the febrile peaks and were positive for golden staph. Patient's evolution was marked by the occurrence of large ischemic stroke and worsening of neurological condition, leading to death after several systemic emboli. Splenic infarction in a pregnant woman is very rare. However, clinical and radiological examination of the spleen must be performed in patients with acute abdominal pain of the left hypochondre. In the present case, pain of the left hypochondre associated with fever and Osler's false whitlow was found to be splenic infarction associated with infectious endocarditis. Probabilistic antibiotic therapy as first-line therapy is justified during infective endocarditis and should be secondarily adapted to the bacteriological results.

Localization of the lesion demonstrated by CT was projected on the Schaltenbrand & Bailey's atlas in each of these patients and the deep brain structure involved was identified. The lesions were located mainly in the posterolateral thalamus including posteromedial part of the internal capsule (thalamic pain), however, they were located outside of the thalamus in some cases (suprathalamic pain). Two particular patients were described in detail because clinical courses, especially operative results were esteemed to be suggestive of an important role of lemniscal system in pain modulation. A 48-year-old man (Case 7) developed severe spontaneous burning pain on the right half of the body after extensive putaminal hemorrhage. Stimulation of the posterior limb of the internal capsule or of the thalamic sensory relay nuclei elicited no pain relief. Consequently a lesion was stereotaxically made in the most medial portion of the lemniscus medialis of the rostral mesencephalon. This operative procedure provoked previously unrecognized significant dysesthesia and hyperpathia predominantly of the extremities as well as aggravation of hypesthesia and hypalgesia. The second patient (Case 8) was a 44-year-old man who developed dysesthesia, hyperpathia and spontaneous pain of the left hand and face after hemorrhage in the right sensory cortex. Stimulation of the mesencephalic lemniscus medialis of the right side elicited comfortable warm sensation in contralateral upper half of the body including hand, fingers and face with simultaneous diminution of pain. These two cases were suggestive of the role of lemniscus medialis in pain modulation. Blockade of the lemniscus medialis elicited, and its facilitation inhibited the pain. Lemniscal and extralemniscal (spinothalamic) system have been proven to be intermingled in the thalamic and suprathalamic levels. Though both of the systems might be involved in the manifestation of central pain including our present ten cases, it was discussed and postulated that the facilitation of the lemniscal system might inhibit the activity of spinothalamic system, thus resulting in pain relief.",{},,No shinkei geka.

However, stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large N80m component, best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate cortex. This early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral Abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal projection. Abnormal link to the pain system may be due to sensitization and reorganization above the level of nociceptive deafferentation.",{},,Neuroreport,10.1097/00001756-199803090-00018,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Functional neuroimaging during SPL movements documented increased response in the ipsilesional supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC), thalamus and caudate. This suggested that motor circuits are important for bodily related cognition, but anatomical evidence is sparse. Here, we tested this hypothesis by studying an extremely rare patient with chronic SPL, still present 3 years after a vascular stroke affecting cortical and subcortical right-hemisphere structures. Anatomical analysis included an advanced in vivo reconstruction of white matter tracts using diffusion-based spherical deconvolution. This reconstruction demonstrated a massive and relatively selective disconnection between anatomically preserved SMA/PMC and the thalamus. Our results provide strong anatomical support for the hypothesis that cortico-thalamic loops involving motor-related circuits are crucial to integrate sensorimotor processing with bodily self-awareness.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Experimental brain research,10.1007/s00221-017-5044-y,,Premotor cortex; Supernumerary phantom limb; Supplementary motor area; Thalamus,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

All patients had reduced temperature sensibility, while the threshold for touch and vibration was abnormal in only 52% and 41%, respectively. Decreased touch and vibration sensibility had a high correlation with high SEP scores, while no correlation was found between reduced temperature sensibility and SEP. The patients with thalamic lesions had the most severely affected SEPs, the ones with lower brain-stem lesions were the least affected.

A 19-year-old woman, who was also 35 weeks pregnant, was admitted to our hospital with headache, nausea, and general fatigue. Neurological examination on admission revealed disturbed consciousness, and the patient's general condition was poor. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a large tumor in the cerebellar vermis along with an obstructive hydrocephalus. Computed tomographic angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction revealed feeding arteries and a draining vein in this tumor. Based on the clinical features, hemangioblastoma was suspected, and surgical excision and extraction of the fetus were scheduled. However, because of rapid neurological deterioration due to tumor progression, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. After extracting the fetus, the level of consciousness improved, so a tumor resection was planned after the patient's general condition improved. However, the neurological state deteriorated again due to the worsening hydrocephalus, which was suspected to be caused by the increased cerebral blood flow following uterine contraction. Emergency surgery for the brain tumor was performed two days after delivery. The tumor was resected completely and histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient and newborn were discharged with no neurological deficits three weeks after the operation. This case suggested that if we encounter patients with brain tumors complicated by pregnancy, not only is earlier diagnosis from clinical features important, but also persistent additional treatment should be carried out without delay to effectively control intracranial pressure.",{},,No shinkei geka.

11075428,[Principles and application of acupuncture in neurology].,"Jellinger, K A",Jellinger,"Acupuncture is a valuable method of complementary medicine with broad application in neurology. It is based on the experiences of traditional Chinese medicine as well as on experimentally proven biological (biochemical and neurophysiological) effects. Acupuncture-induced analgesia is mediated by inhibition of pain transmission at a spinal level and activation of central pain-modulating centers by release of opioids and other peptides that can be prevented by opioid antagonists (naloxone). Modern neuroimaging methods (functional MRI) confirmed the activation of subcortical and cortical centers, while transcranial Doppler sonography and SPECT showed an increase of cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen supply in normal subjects. Clinical experience and controlled studies confirmed the efficacy of acupuncture in various pain syndromes (tension headache, migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, posttraumatic pain, lumbar syndrome, ischialgia, etc.) and suggest favorable effects in the rehabilitation of peripheral facial nerve palsy and after stroke. Appropriate techniques, hygiene safeguards and knowledge of contraindications will minimize the risks of rare side effects of acupuncture which represents a valuable adjunction to the treatment repertoire in modern neurology. There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its pathophysiology and clinical value.",{},,Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Austria,ger

The first patient had a right hemibody pain secondary to a left parietal infarct sparing the thalamus, while the second patient had left lower limb pain developed after a right mesencephalic infarct. In both cases, spontaneous pain was associated with hyperpathia, allodynia and hypoaesthesia in the painful territory involving both lemniscal and extra-lemniscal sensory modalities in patient 1, extra-lemniscal sensory modality only in patient 2. Both patients were treated with electrical PGS by means of a 4-pole electrode, the central sulcus being per-operatively located using the phase-reversal of the N20 wave of somatosensory evoked potentials. No sensory side effect, abnormal movement or epileptic seizure were observed during PGS. The analgesic effects were somatotopically distributed according to the localization of electrode on motor cortex. A satisfactory long-lasting pain control (60-70% on visual analog scale) as well as attenuation of nociceptive reflexes were obtained during PGS in the first patient. Pain relief was less marked and only transient (2 months) in patient 2, in spite of a similar operative procedure. In this patient, in whom PGS eventually evoked painful dysethesiae, no attenuation of nociceptive RIII reflex could be evidenced during PGS. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was studied using emission tomography (PET) with O-labeled water. The sites of CBF increase during PGS were the same in both patients, namely the thalamus ipsilateral to PGS, cingulate gyrus, orbito-frontal cortex and brainstem. CBF increase in brainstem structures was greater and lasted longer in patient 1 while patient 2 showed a greater CBF increase in orbito-frontal and cingular regions. Our results suggest that PGS-induced analgesia is somatotopically mediated and does not require the integrity of somatosensory cortex and lemniscal system. PGS analgesic efficacy may be mainly related to increased synaptic activity in the thalamus and brainstem while changes in cingulate gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex may be rather related to attentional and/or emotional processes. The inhibitory control on pain would involve thalamic and/or brainstem relays on descending pathways down to the spinal cord segments, leading to a depression of nociceptive reflexes. Painful dysesthesiae during stimulation have to be distinguished from other innocuous sensory side effects, since they may compromise PGS efficacy.",{},,Pain,10.1016/0304-3959(94)00211-V,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Chronic pain after rib fractures is also commonly reported. Acupuncture is widely used in the management of pain but its use has been reported rarely in the traumatic brain injury literature. This case report suggests that acupuncture may be a useful option to consider in these patients. Outcome was assessed formally using a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale for pain, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for psychological status before and after the course of treatment. These scales are widely used in clinical practice as well as in research involving patients with traumatic brain injury, although they have not been validated in this population.

26654661,Report of Dramatic Improvement after a Lumboperitoneal Shunt Procedure in a Case of Anticoagulation Therapy-Resistant Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.,"Torikoshi, Sadaharu; Akiyama, Yoshinori",Torikoshi,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), which typically progresses from either acute or subacute onset, presents with symptoms related to intracranial hypertension (e.g., headache and papilledema) and brain parenchymal lesions (e.g., aphasia and hemiplegia). Anticoagulation therapy is generally accepted as a treatment for CVT and often leads to good clinical outcomes. However, we experienced a case of CVT with an uncommon clinical course. The patient was a 63-year-old man who presented with headache, papilledema, visual loss, and diplopia; his condition gradually deteriorated, and he was diagnosed with CVT via cerebral angiography. The sinus thrombus was extensive and resistant to anticoagulation therapy, and lumbar puncture revealed a progressive increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. We performed a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt procedure, which yielded marked improvement in the symptoms. The main mechanism of neurological dysfunction in CVT is venous outflow obstruction caused by venous thrombus, which results in brain edema, and/or venous infarction, which induces focal neurological signs. Another mechanism is impaired CSF absorption in the thrombosed sinuses, resulting in intracranial hypertension. We speculated that the latter mechanism strongly influenced our case, thus explaining the uncommon clinical course and effectiveness of the LP shunt procedure. Although LP shunting is not a common treatment for CVT, this case report could indicate the usefulness of this procedure for CVT with chronic progression and resistance to anticoagulation therapy.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2015.10.023,,Cerebral venous thrombosis; extensive thrombus; impaired cerebrospinal fluid absorption; lumboperitoneal shunt; resistance to anticoagulation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng
