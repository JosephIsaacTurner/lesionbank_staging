33647851,Auditory agnosia with anosognosia.,"Klarendić, Maja; Gorišek, Veronika R; Granda, Gal; Avsenik, Jernej; Zgonc, Vid; Kojović, Maja",Klarendić,"A 66-year-old right-handed female medical doctor suffered two consecutive cardioembolic strokes, initially affecting the right frontal lobe and the right insula, followed by a lesion in the left temporal lobe. The patient presented with distinctive phenomenology of general auditory agnosia with anosognosia for the deficit. She did not understand verbal requests and her answers to oral questions were fluent but unrelated to the topic. However, she was able to correctly answer written questions, name objects, and fluently describe their purpose, which is characteristic for verbal auditory agnosia. She was also unable to recognise environmental sounds or to recognise and repeat any melody. These inabilities represent environmental sound agnosia and amusia, respectively. Surprisingly, she was not aware of the problem, not asking any questions regarding her symptoms, and avoiding discussing her inability to understand spoken language, which is indicative of anosognosia. The deficits in our patient followed a distinct pattern of recovery. The verbal auditory agnosia was the first to resolve, followed by environmental sound agnosia. Amusia persisted the longest. The patient was clinically assessed from the first day of symptom onset and the evolution of symptoms was video documented. We give a detailed account of the patient's behaviour and provide results of audiological and neuropsychological evaluations. We discuss the anatomy of auditory agnosia and anosognosia relevant to the case. This case study may serve to better understand auditory agnosia in clinical settings. It is important to distinguish auditory agnosia from Wernicke's aphasia, because use of written language may enable normal communication.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '02'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.12.025,,Amusia; Anosognosia; Auditory agnosia; Environmental sound agnosia; Verbal auditory agnosia,Case Reports,Italy,eng

Two nonapraxic patients with lesions in the left occipital lobe could imitate pantomimes they could not recognise. Although both patients had a hemianopia, sparing of gesture imitation shows that no visual defect accounts for their inability to recognise pantomimes. Both patients were amnestic and alexic but had no general impairment of cognitive ability to account for a pantomime-recognition disorder. These patients seem to have agnosia for pantomime. From the computed tomograms from these patients, we propose that inferior visual association cortex is critical for gesture comprehension, whereas superior portions of these structures are critical for imitating or performing pantomime to an object presented visually.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.49.4.451,PMC1028777,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

They also had anosognosia, visuospatial disorders, and emotional flattening. In animals, neglect can be induced by lesions along a cortico-limbic-reticular loop including the intralaminar thalamic nuclei.

34694463,Isolated post-traumatic astereognosis: a case-based review.,"Khormi, Yahya H; Atteya, Mostafa M E",Khormi,"Astereognosis is the tactile inability to recognize objects placed in the palms by touch with the eyes closed or blind-folded in the presence of intact primary sensory modalities. Stereognosis is usually considered a function of the contralateral sensory cerebral cortex. However, lesions of several anatomic areas and pathologic entities have been reported to be associated with astereognosis. Only two previous reports linked traumatic injury to isolated astereognosis: following surgical evacuation of traumatic parietal extradural hematoma and following bullet injury in the neck in 1992 and 1919, respectively. All the pertinent literature was analyzed, focusing on the relevant definitions, clinical spectra, pathoanatomical processes, assessment, management, and outcomes of astereognosis. Also, an illustrative case was presented. The case highlights isolated post-traumatic left hand astereognosis in a 17-year-old boy following a blunt trauma to the head which resulted in a non-hemorrhagic contusion of the right post-central gyrus. Post-traumatic isolated astereognosis is a rare and probably underreported sequel of traumatic brain injury. Neurosurgeons need to be more sensitive to the assessment and detection of subtle stereognostic deficits in general and in trauma patients in particular. Other anatomical areas, in addition to the contralateral post-central gyrus, may be considered in the pathogenesis of astereognosis with the involvement of the dorsal column medial lemniscus tract such as the brainstem, foramen magnum, and the cervical spinal cord. To the best of our knowledge, this rare case report is considered the second report on astereognosis following head trauma, and the third report on astereognosis following trauma in general.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,10.1007/s00381-021-05392-5,,Astereognosis; Morphognosia; Post-central gyrus; Stereoanesthesia; Tactile agnosia; Traumatic brain injury,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Germany,eng

9178535,Mirror agnosia.,"Ramachandran, V S; Altschuler, E L; Hillyer, S",Ramachandran,"Normal people rarely confuse the mirror image of an object with a real object so long as they realize they are looking into a mirror. We report a new neurological sign, 'mirror agnosia', following right parietal lesions in which this ability is severely compromised. We studied four right hemisphere stroke patients who had left visual field 'neglect'. i.e. they were indifferent to objects in their left visual field even though they were not blind. We then placed a vertical parasagittal mirror on each patients' right so that they could clearly see the reflection of objects placed in the (neglected) visual field. When shown a candy or pen on their left, the patients kept banging their hand into the mirror or groped behind it attempting to grab the reflection; they did not reach for the real object on the left, even though they were mentally quite lucid and knew they were looking into a mirror. Remarkably, all four patients kept complaining that the object was 'in the mirror', 'outside my reach' or 'behind the mirror'. Thus, even the patients' ability to make simple logical inferences about mirrors has been selectively warped to accommodate the strange new sensory world that they now inhabit. The finding may have implications for understanding how the brain creates representations of mirror reflections.",{},,Proceedings.

To verify the potential role of body-related sensory (proprioceptive, visual, and somatosensory) manipulation in patients experiencing sensations of hand disownership, the symptoms of a patient suffering from right-hand somatoparaphrenia were monitored and clinical and neuropsychological variables were controlled. Four types of manipulation were administered: changes in spatial position of the hand, multisensory stimulation, and self-observation using video or mirrors. Multisensory visuo-tactile stimulation was efficacious in terms of reducing somatoparaphrenia, and changes in the position of the hand produced some positive effects. Third-person perspective self-observation did not, however, result in any changes.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2017.1329444,,Disturbed sensation of limb ownership; Gertmann’s syndrome; body awareness; rehabilitation; somatoparaphrenia after a left-hemisphere lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

This is a rare disease that should be suspected in strange or poorly congruent visual loss. It is usually due to an ischaemic injury in this region of brain, manifesting itself with low vision not perceived by the patient (visual confabulation).

It has been shown that this phenomenon of letter-by-letter reading cannot be accounted for by visual or perceptual factors nor by impairment of visual span of apprehension. The exceptionally slow speed of reading was documented and a clear relationship between word length and reading speed established. Performance on tasks considered to maximize whole word reading which at the same time prevent the possibility of letter-by-letter reading, namely, reading script and reading with tachistoscopic presentation, was impaired. The satisfactory performance of these two patients on tasks of picture interpretation suggests that the two components of the syndrome simultanagnosia, letter-by-letter reading and piecemeal perception of complex scenes, are dissociable. Three alternative explanations of letter-by-letter reading are considered and we conclude that in this type of acquired dyslexia there is damage to the system through which a visual word-form is attained.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/103.1.99,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
30617908,Patient MW: transient visual hemi-agnosia.,"Decramer, Thomas; Premereur, Elsie; Lagae, Lieven; van Loon, Johannes; Janssen, Peter; Sunaert, Stefan; Theys, Tom",Decramer,"The concept of functional modularity in human visual processing was proposed 25 years ago with the distinction between a ventral pathway for object recognition and a dorsal pathway for action processing. Lesions along these pathways yield selective deficits. A 15-year-old patient (MW) presented with a seizure due to a lesion in the left occipitotemporal cortex. Surgical resection of the lesion was performed with sparing of the classic language areas and visual fields. Postoperatively MW had great difficulty reading and had a specific agnosia for more complex visual stimuli in the right hemifield. No deficit was seen for lower level visual discrimination tasks. Gradual improvement of hemi-agnosia was paralleled by slower reaction times reflecting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Absolute reading speed improved markedly over time, doubling at 6 weeks. MW fully recovered after 18 months. Postoperative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) illustrated an overlap of the lesion with object and word processing areas. Diffusion Tensor Imaging showed damage to the white matter tracts [inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF)] interconnecting ventral temporal areas. A transient higher order deficit can result from a disruption of the neural network supporting visual word and object processing. Most visual system research has focused on cortical areas, while the underlying subcortical network received much less attention. We believe that white matter tracts, in particular the ILF, play a critical role in object perception by connecting visual areas along the ventral visual stream. Lesions of the ILF should be taken into consideration in agnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '07'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Journal of neurology,10.1007/s00415-019-09188-1,,Occipitotemporal cortex; Reading; Ventral visual pathway; Visual agnosia; Visual pathways; Visual perception; Visual processing,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng

He had good visual and hearing acuity, no hemianopsia, unilateral spatial neglect and visual object agnosia. However, he was unable to remember faces of his rehabilitation therapists, and repeatedly misidentified other patients' visitors and therapists as his family members and friends, without recognizing his mistakes. General cognitive function was preserved with Hasegawa dementia score-revised (HDS-R) 25/30 (cut-off score 20). In terms of recognition of faces, tasks not requiring recognition of facial identity, such as interpreting facial emotions, and gender and age assessment, were relatively preserved, but recognition of family members and celebrities was severely impaired, and matching unfamiliar faces was slightly impaired. Semantic information of family and friends was retained. Although his symptoms resembled associative prosopagnosia, they differed from general associative prosopagnosia in having phonagnosia. MRI lesions were localized in the frontal and temporal lobes including the right anterior temporal lobe, and not in the right occipital and temporal lobes considered to the lesion site of multimodal people recognition disorders manifesting inability of utilization of visual (face) and auditory (voice) cues for person identification. In addition to the facial cognitive impairment, impaired exploratory (monitoring) function of the frontal lobe on the temporal lobe may also contribute to the false recognition/misidentification of this case.","DictElement({'Year': '2021', 'Month': '12', 'Day': '30'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2021,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.12.005,,Associative prosopagnosia; Cerebral infarction; False recognition/misidentification; Frégoli syndrome; Multimodal people recognition disorders; Right fronto-temporal lesion,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Here we describe the case of J, a 30 year old woman who reports being unable to recognize her parents, her husband, or herself in the mirror. We set out to assess the severity of J's prosopagnosia using tests with unfamiliar as well as familiar faces and investigated whether impaired configural processing explains her deficit. To assess the specificity of the impairment, we tested J's performance when evaluating emotions, intentions, and the attractiveness and likability of faces. Detailed testing revealed typical brain activity patterns for faces and normal object recognition skills, and no evidence of any brain injury. However, compared to a group of matched controls, J showed severe deficits in learning new faces, and in recognizing familiar faces when only inner features were available. Her recognition of uncropped faces with blurred features was within the normal range, indicating preserved configural processing when peripheral features are available. J was also unimpaired when evaluating intentions and emotions in faces. In line with healthy controls, J rated more average faces as more attractive. However, she was the only one to rate them as less likable, indicating a preference for more distinctive and easier to recognize faces. Taken together, the results illustrate both the severity and the specificity of DP in a single case. While DP is a heterogeneous disorder, an inability to integrate the inner features of the face into a whole might be the best explanation for the difficulties many individuals with prosopagnosia experience.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,BMC psychology,10.1186/s40359-019-0278-z,PMC6343346,Configural processing; Developmental prosopagnosia; Face perception; Object recognition; fMRI,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng
29100949,Plasticity of the human visual brain after an early cortical lesion.,"Mikellidou, K; Arrighi, R; Aghakhanyan, G; Tinelli, F; Frijia, F; Crespi, S; De Masi, F; Montanaro, D; Morrone, M C",Mikellidou,"In adults, partial damage to V1 or optic radiations abolishes perception in the corresponding part of the visual field, causing a scotoma. However, it is widely accepted that the developing cortex has superior capacities to reorganize following an early lesion to endorse adaptive plasticity. Here we report a single patient case (G.S.) with near normal central field vision despite a massive unilateral lesion to the optic radiations acquired early in life. The patient underwent surgical removal of a right hemisphere parieto-temporal-occipital atypical choroid plexus papilloma of the right lateral ventricle at four months of age, which presumably altered the visual pathways during in utero development. Both the tumor and surgery severely compromised the optic radiations. Residual vision of G.S. was tested psychophysically when the patient was 7 years old. We found a close-to-normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity within the central 25° and a great impairment in form and contrast vision in the far periphery (40-50°) of the left visual hemifield. BOLD response to full field luminance flicker was recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) and in a region in the residual temporal-occipital region, presumably corresponding to the middle temporal complex (MT+), of the lesioned (right) hemisphere. A population receptive field analysis of the BOLD responses to contrast modulated stimuli revealed a retinotopic organization just for the MT+ region but not for the calcarine regions. Interestingly, consistent islands of ipsilateral activity were found in MT+ and in the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) of the intact hemisphere. Probabilistic tractography revealed that optic radiations between LGN and V1 were very sparse in the lesioned hemisphere consistently with the post-surgery cerebral resection, while normal in the intact hemisphere. On the other hand, strong structural connections between MT+ and LGN were found in the lesioned hemisphere, while the equivalent tract in the spared hemisphere showed minimal structural connectivity. These results suggest that during development of the pathological brain, abnormal thalamic projections can lead to functional cortical changes, which may mediate functional recovery of vision.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '31'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.033,,Contrast sensitivity; Cortical reorganization; DTI; Early brain lesion; Hemianopia; Neural plasticity; Retinotopic map; Visual cortex; fMRI; pRF,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, patterns of white matter tract disconnection following parietal damage have been barely investigated. This single case study allows characterising Gerstmann's syndrome in terms of disconnected networks. We report the case of a left parietal patient affected by Gerstmann's tetrad: agraphia, acalculia, left/right orientation problems, and finger agnosia. Lesion mapping, atlas-based estimation of probability of disconnection, and DTI-based tractography revealed that the lesion was mainly located in the superior parietal lobule, and it caused disruption of both intraparietal tracts passing through the inferior parietal lobule (e.g., tracts connecting the angular, supramarginal, postcentral gyri, and the superior parietal lobule) and fronto-parietal long tracts (e.g., the superior longitudinal fasciculus). The lesion site appears to be located more superiorly as compared to the cerebral regions shown active by other studies during tasks impaired in the syndrome, and it reached the subcortical area potentially critical in the emergence of the syndrome, as hypothesised in previous studies. Importantly, the reconstruction of tracts connecting regions within the parietal lobe indicates that this critical subcortical area is mainly crossed by white matter tracts connecting the angular gyrus and the superior parietal lobule. Taken together, these findings suggest that this case study might be considered as empirical evidence of Gerstmann's tetrad caused by disconnection of intraparietal white matter tracts.","DictElement({'Year': '2023', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '27'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2023,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2023.05.016,,Gerstmann's syndrome; Lesion Mapping; Optic ataxia; White matter tract disconnection; stroke,"Case Reports; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
28951167,Still holding after all these years: An action-perception dissociation in patient DF.,"Ganel, Tzvi; Goodale, Melvyn A",Ganel,"Patient DF, who has bilateral damage in the ventral visual stream, is perhaps the best known individual with visual form agnosia in the world, and has been the focus of scores of research papers over the past twenty-five years. The remarkable dissociation she exhibits between a profound deficit in perceptual report and a preserved ability to generate relatively normal visuomotor behaviour was early on a cornerstone in Goodale and Milner's (1992) two visual systems hypothesis. In recent years, however, there has been a greater emphasis on the damage that is evident in the posterior regions of her parietal cortex in both hemispheres. Deficits in several aspects of visuomotor control in the visual periphery have been demonstrated, leading some researchers to conclude that the double dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action in DF and patients with classic optic ataxia can no longer be assumed to be strong evidence for the division of labour between the dorsal and ventral streams of visual processing. In this short review, we argue that this is not the case. Indeed, after evaluating DF's performance and the location of her brain lesions, a clear picture of a double dissociation between DF and patients with optic ataxia is revealed. More than quarter of a century after the initial presentation of DF's unique case, she continues to provide compelling evidence for the idea that the ventral stream is critical for the perception of the shape and orientation of objects but not the visual control of skilled actions directed at those objects.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.09.016,,Perception and action; Two-visual streams; Visual-form agnosia; Visuomotor control,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,England,eng

22764352,[Neurological disease and facial recognition].,"Kawamura, Mitsuru; Sugimoto, Azusa; Kobayakawa, Mutsutaka; Tsuruya, Natsuko",Kawamura,"To discuss the neurological basis of facial recognition, we present our case reports of impaired recognition and a review of previous literature. First, we present a case of infarction and discuss prosopagnosia, which has had a large impact on face recognition research. From a study of patient symptoms, we assume that prosopagnosia may be caused by unilateral right occipitotemporal lesion and right cerebral dominance of facial recognition. Further, circumscribed lesion and degenerative disease may also cause progressive prosopagnosia. Apperceptive prosopagnosia is observed in patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), pathologically considered as Alzheimer's disease, and associative prosopagnosia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Second, we discuss face recognition as part of communication. Patients with Parkinson disease show social cognitive impairments, such as difficulty in facial expression recognition and deficits in theory of mind as detected by the reading the mind in the eyes test. Pathological and functional imaging studies indicate that social cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease is possibly related to damages in the amygdalae and surrounding limbic system. The social cognitive deficits can be observed in the early stages of Parkinson disease, and even in the prodromal stage, for example, patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) show impairment in facial expression recognition. Further, patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1), which is a multisystem disease that mainly affects the muscles, show social cognitive impairment similar to that of Parkinson disease. Our previous study showed that facial expression recognition impairment of DM 1 patients is associated with lesion in the amygdalae and insulae. Our study results indicate that behaviors and personality traits in DM 1 patients, which are revealed by social cognitive impairment, are attributable to dysfunction of the limbic system.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

In contrast, auditory verbal agnosia is the disproportionate difficulty comprehending spoken compared to written language, also typically greater than difficulties with spoken and written language expression, in the absence of a primary sensory deficit. The terms pure word deafness and auditory verbal agnosia are often used synonymously. However, the broader term of auditory agnosia more accurately reflects difficulty processing both speech and non-speech sounds whereas individuals with auditory verbal agnosia (pure word deafness) have preserved processing of environmental sounds. Auditory agnosia is reported in the stroke literature, but rarely reported in progressive neurologic disorders. Here, we report a case of a woman who presented with what is best described as a prominent auditory deficit in the context of an initially unclassifiable, or mixed, primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with accompanying apraxia of speech. Her clinical presentation shared features with auditory agnosia, although sensory functioning was not formally assessed. We report clinical and neuroimaging data spanning 6 years and subsequent autopsy results. She presented at 65 years of age, 5 years post onset of symptoms that included insidious and progressive difficulties thinking of words, constructing sentences, pronouncing words, and understanding instructions. She had disproportionate difficulty with comprehension of spoken compared to written language. She eventually developed features of the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA, as well as an apraxia of speech. Imaging with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET revealed progression of bilateral (left greater than right) hypometabolism involving the frontal, temporal (predominantly the lateral superior gyrus), and parietal lobes, that eventually included the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and caudate.

28949822,Preserved Expert Object Recognition in a Case of Visual Hemiagnosia.,"Rennig, Johannes; Cornelsen, Sonja; Wilhelm, Helmut; Himmelbach, Marc; Karnath, Hans-Otto",Rennig,"We examined a stroke patient (HWS) with a unilateral lesion of the right medial ventral visual stream, involving the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri. In a number of object recognition tests with lateralized presentations of target stimuli, HWS showed significant symptoms of hemiagnosia with contralesional recognition deficits for everyday objects. We further explored the patient's capacities of visual expertise that were acquired before the current perceptual impairment became effective. We confronted him with objects he was an expert for already before stroke onset and compared this performance with the recognition of familiar everyday objects. HWS was able to identify significantly more of the specific (""expert"") than of the everyday objects on the affected contralesional side. This observation of better expert object recognition in visual hemiagnosia allows for several interpretations. The results may be caused by enhanced information processing for expert objects in the ventral system in the affected or the intact hemisphere. Expert knowledge could trigger top-down mechanisms supporting object recognition despite of impaired basic functions of object processing. More importantly, the current work demonstrates that top-down mechanisms of visual expertise influence object recognition at an early stage, probably before visual object information propagates to modules of higher object recognition. Because HWS showed a lesion to the fusiform gyrus and spared capacities of expert object recognition, the current study emphasizes possible contributions of areas outside the ventral stream to visual expertise.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '09', 'Day': '26'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Journal of cognitive neuroscience,10.1162/jocn_a_01193,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The patient presented here is unique owing to his unusual macrosomatognosia phenomenology, but also given the unreported localization of his most significant lesion in the right thalamus that allowed consistent anatomo-clinical analysis. This 45-years old man presented mainly with long-lasting and quasi-delusional macrosomatognosia associated to sensory deficits, both involving the left upper-body, in the context of a right thalamic ischemic lesion most presumably located in the ventral posterolateral nucleus. Fine-grained probabilistic and deterministic tractography revealed the most eloquent targets of the lesion projections to be the ipsilateral precuneus, superior parietal lobule,but also the right primary somatosensory cortex and, to a lesser extent, the right primary motor cortex. Under stationary neurorehabilitation, the patient slowly improved his symptoms and could be discharged back home and, later on, partially return to work. We discuss deficient neural processing and integration of sensory inputs within the right ventral posterolateral nucleus lesion as possible mechanisms underlying macrosomatognosia in light of observed anatomo-clinical correlations. On the other hand, difficulty to classify this unique constellation of Alice in wonderland syndrome calls for an alternative taxonomy of cognitive and psychic aspects of illusory body-size perceptions.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '28'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,BMC neurology,10.1186/s12883-020-01970-3,PMC7594440,Alice in wonderland syndrome; Diffusion tractography; Macrosomatognosia; Stroke; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Routine neuropsychological examination conducted >4 years after the onset of brain damage showed little deficits of minor severity. In contrast, both patients reported persistent unusual visual impairment. A comprehensive series of tachistoscopic experiments with lateralized stimulus presentation and comparison with healthy participants revealed partial visual hemiagnosia for stimuli presented to their contralesional hemifield, applying inferential single-case statistics to evaluate deficits and dissociations. Double dissociations were found in 4 experiments during which participants had to integrate more than one visual element, either through comparison or formation of a global gestalt. Against the background of recent neuroimaging findings, we conclude that of all medial parietal structures, the precuneus is the most likely candidate for a crucial involvement in such bottom-up visual integration.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '19'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",10.1093/cercor/bhu256,,double dissociation; hemiagnosia; neurovisual disorder; precuneus; tachistoscopic presentation,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Her basic somatosensory functions were normal. The appreciation of substance qualities (hylognosia) was preserved, but the patient's inability to recognize the size and shape (morphagnosia) was confined to 2- and 3-dimensional shapes (amorphagnosia) in the left hand. However, the patient's ability to recognize real daily objects was well preserved. Brain MRI after admission showed ischemic lesions confined to the right pre- and postcentral gyri and the medial frontal cortex on DWI and FLAIR images. An analysis of SPECT images revealed that the most decreased areas were localized to the pre- and postcentral gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Considering the previous reported cases, the responsible lesion for the impaired perception of hylognosia and morphagnosia may not necessarily be confined to the right hemisphere. To date, 5 reports (6 cases) of tactile agnosia have been published; 4 cases presented with both ahylognosia and amorphagnosia, while 1 presented with only amorphagnosia, and another showed amorphagnosia and mild ahylognosia. Our case is the first to present with only amorphagnosia without tactile agnosia. The mechanism for the well-preserved recognition of real objects may depend on the preserved hylognosia. Of note, there have been no reports showing only ahylognosia without amorphagnosia. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether or not patients with preserved hylognosia or morphagnosia retain the ability to perceive real objects.","DictElement({'Year': '2017', 'Month': '04', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2017,Case reports in neurology,10.1159/000466684,PMC5437437,Ahylognosia; Amorphagnosia; Cerebral infarction; Tactile agnosia,Case Reports,Switzerland,eng

Here, we explored the neural basis of shape processing in a patient with visual agnosia following a circumscribed right hemisphere ventral lesion and evaluated longitudinal changes in the neural profile of shape representations. The results revealed a reduction of shape sensitivity slopes along the patient's right ventral pathway and a similar reduction in the contralesional left ventral pathway. Remarkably, posterior parts of the dorsal pathway bilaterally also evinced a reduction in shape sensitivity. These findings were similar over a two-year interval, revealing that a focal cortical lesion can lead to persistent large-scale alterations of the two visual pathways. These alterations are consistent with the view that a distributed network of regions contributes to shape perception.","DictElement({'Year': '2020', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '25'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2020,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.05.009,PMC9972005,Object recognition; Two visual pathways; Visual agnosia; fMRI,"Case Reports; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Here we report new functional neuroimaging data obtained on PS with a recently developed fast periodic stimulation functional imaging (FPS-fMRI) paradigm combining high sensitivity, specificity and reliability in identifying the cortical face-selective network (Gao et al., 2018). We define the extent of the large and reliable face-selective activation in the lateral section of the right middle fusiform gyrus, i.e., right FFA, which forms a single cluster of activation lying at the anterior border of the patient's main lesion in the inferior occipital gyrus. The contribution of posterior face-selective responses in the right or left inferior occipital gyrus is ruled out, strongly supporting the view that face-selective activity emerges in the right middle fusiform gyrus of the patient's brain from non-face-selective inputs from early visual areas. Despite this, low-level visual cues, i.e., amplitude spectrum of images, do not contribute to neural face-selective responses anywhere in the patient's cortical face network. This sensitive face-localizer approach also reveals an intact face-selective network anterior to the fusiform gyrus, including clusters in the ventral anterior temporal lobe (occipito-temporal sulcus and temporal pole) and the inferior frontal gyrus, with a right hemispheric dominance. Overall, with the exception of the left inferior occipital gyrus, the cortical face network of the prosopagnosic patient PS appears remarkably similar to typical individuals in non-brain damaged regions. However, unlike in neurotypical adults tested in the present study, including age-matched controls, a novel paradigm based on FPS-FMRI confirms that the patient's face network is insensitive to differences between rapidly presented pictures of unfamiliar individual faces, in line with her prosopagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '11', 'Day': '17'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2018.11.008,,Face categorization; Individual face discrimination; Prosopagnosia; fMRI,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

We report a patient (JW) with severe long-standing CRPS who had no difficulty identifying and naming line drawings of objects presented in 1 of 4 cardinal orientations. In contrast, he was extremely poor at reorienting these objects into the correct upright orientation and in judging whether an object was upright or not. Moreover, JW made orientation errors when copying drawings of objects, and he also showed features of mirror reversal in writing single words and reading single letters. The findings are discussed in relation to accounts of visual processing. Agnosia for object orientation is the term for impaired knowledge of an object's orientation despite good recognition and naming of the same misoriented object. This defect has previously only been reported in patients with major structural brain lesions. The neuroanatomical correlates are discussed. The patient had no structural brain lesion, raising the possibility that nonstructural reorganisation of cortical networks may be responsible for his deficits.

Clues from asomatognosia and somatoparaphrenia.,"Romano, Daniele; Maravita, Angelo",Romano,"The sense of ownership is the feeling that a body part belongs to ourselves. Brain damage may disrupt this feeling, leading to somatoparaphrenia (SP), i.e., the delusion that one's limbs belong to someone else. This delusional feeling is typically associated with profound motor and somatosensory deficits. We reviewed the cases of SP reported so far in the literature outlining the clinical and neuroanatomical profile of SP. We then investigated and reported three new peculiar cases of SP that allow new insights into the theoretical framework of this neuropsychological condition. We thus propose an innovative theoretical account that integrates previous evidence and the new cases described. We suggest that a defective update of the ongoing dynamic representation of the body finalised to perception and action, may be the key for the disownership feelings of patients with SP. The erroneous spatial representation of the limb contralateral to the lesion would have the logical consequence of delusional misattribution of the seen own arm.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '11'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2019.107119,,Body awareness; Body ownership; Body representation; Body schema; Right brain damage; Somatoparaphrenia,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

People with Acquired Prosopagnosia (AP), who have lost the ability to recognise faces after a brain lesion, should thus show atypical holistic coding. Our aim is to use the composite-face effect (CFE) as a measure of holistic processing in ST, a 48-year-old woman with AP but normal recognition of facial expressions of emotions, and matched healthy control participants. Two experiments examining the CFE for identity (Experiment 1) and for expression of emotions (Experiment 2) were conducted. Contrary to controls, in both experiments, ST showed an atypical (i.e., reversed) CFE, thus suggesting altered holistic mechanisms affecting both components of perceptual judgement.

24561388,Selective preservation of the beat in apperceptive music agnosia: a case study.,"Baird, Amee D; Walker, David G; Biggs, Vivien; Robinson, Gail A",Baird,"Music perception involves processing of melodic, temporal and emotional dimensions that have been found to dissociate in healthy individuals and after brain injury. Two components of the temporal dimension have been distinguished, namely rhythm and metre. We describe an 18 year old male musician 'JM' who showed apperceptive music agnosia with selectively preserved metre perception, and impaired recognition of sad and peaceful music relative to age and music experience matched controls after resection of a right temporoparietal tumour. Two months post-surgery JM underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation including assessment of his music perception abilities using the Montreal Battery for Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA, Peretz, Champod, & Hyde, 2003). He also completed several experimental tasks to explore his ability to recognise famous songs and melodies, emotions portrayed by music and a broader range of environmental sounds. Five age-, gender-, education- and musical experienced-matched controls were administered the same experimental tasks. JM showed selective preservation of metre perception, with impaired performances compared to controls and scoring below the 5% cut-off on all MBEA subtests, except for the metric condition. He could identify his favourite songs and environmental sounds. He showed impaired recognition of sad and peaceful emotions portrayed in music relative to controls but intact ability to identify happy and scary music. This case study contributes to the scarce literature documenting a dissociation between rhythmic and metric processing, and the rare observation of selectively preserved metric interpretation in the context of apperceptive music agnosia. It supports the notion that the anterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) plays a role in metric processing and provides the novel observation that selectively preserved metre is sufficient to identify happy and scary, but not sad or peaceful emotions portrayed in music.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '22'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.01.005,,Apperceptive amusia; Metre; Music; Neuropsychology; Temporal processing,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng
25046697,Pure associative tactile agnosia for the left hand: clinical and anatomo-functional correlations.,"Veronelli, Laura; Ginex, Valeria; Dinacci, Daria; Cappa, Stefano F; Corbo, Massimo",Veronelli,"Associative tactile agnosia (TA) is defined as the inability to associate information about object sensory properties derived through tactile modality with previously acquired knowledge about object identity. The impairment is often described after a lesion involving the parietal cortex (Caselli, 1997; Platz, 1996). We report the case of SA, a right-handed 61-year-old man affected by first ever right hemispheric hemorrhagic stroke. The neurological examination was normal, excluding major somaesthetic and motor impairment; a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a right subacute hemorrhagic lesion limited to the post-central and supra-marginal gyri. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation detected a selective inability to name objects when handled with the left hand in the absence of other cognitive deficits. A series of experiments were conducted in order to assess each stage of tactile recognition processing using the same stimulus sets: materials, 3D geometrical shapes, real objects and letters. SA and seven matched controls underwent the same experimental tasks during four sessions in consecutive days. Tactile discrimination, recognition, pantomime, drawing after haptic exploration out of vision and tactile-visual matching abilities were assessed. In addition, we looked for the presence of a supra-modal impairment of spatial perception and of specific difficulties in programming exploratory movements during recognition. Tactile discrimination was intact for all the stimuli tested. In contrast, SA was able neither to recognize nor to pantomime real objects manipulated with the left hand out of vision, while he identified them with the right hand without hesitations. Tactile-visual matching was intact. Furthermore, SA was able to grossly reproduce the global shape in drawings but failed to extract details of objects after left-hand manipulation, and he could not identify objects after looking at his own drawings. This case confirms the existence of selective associative TA as a left hand-specific deficit in recognizing objects. This deficit is not related to spatial perception or to the programming of exploratory movements. The cross-modal transfer of information via visual perception permits the activation of a partially degraded image, which alone does not allow the proper recognition of the initial tactile stimulus.","DictElement({'Year': '2014', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '01'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2014,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.06.015,,Apraxia; Cross-modal transfer; Parietal lobe; Somatosensory perception; Tactile agnosia; Tactile object recognition,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

We have shown that the occlusion of the right PCA also produced a left unilateral agnosia which is one of the common neurological signs in the right MCA infarction. To tell whether the responsible lesion for the unilateral spatial agnosia differs between the PCA occlusion and the MCA occlusion, the correlation study should be carried out in a greater number of the subjects.

The patient was also unable to match spoken letters and numbers to their visual form, indicating that she could not access the graphemic representations of letters from their phonological representations.

Follow-up tests confirmed difficulties with auditory segregation in her left ear that spanned multiple domains, including words-in-noise and music streaming. Testing with a stochastic figure-ground task-a way of estimating generic acoustic foreground and background segregation-demonstrated that this was also abnormal. This is the first demonstration of an acquired deficit in the segregation of complex acoustic patterns due to cortical damage, which we argue is a causal explanation for the symptomatic deficits in the segregation of speech and music. These symptoms are analogous to the visual symptom of simultaneous agnosia. Consistent with functional imaging studies on normal listeners, the work implicates non-primary auditory cortex.

20547387,A new selective developmental deficit: Impaired object recognition with normal face recognition.,"Germine, Laura; Cashdollar, Nathan; Düzel, Emrah; Duchaine, Bradley",Germine,"Studies of developmental deficits in face recognition, or developmental prosopagnosia, have shown that individuals who have not suffered brain damage can show face recognition impairments coupled with normal object recognition (Duchaine and Nakayama, 2005; Duchaine et al., 2006; Nunn et al., 2001). However, no developmental cases with the opposite dissociation - normal face recognition with impaired object recognition - have been reported. The existence of a case of non-face developmental visual agnosia would indicate that the development of normal face recognition mechanisms does not rely on the development of normal object recognition mechanisms. To see whether a developmental variant of non-face visual object agnosia exists, we conducted a series of web-based object and face recognition tests to screen for individuals showing object recognition memory impairments but not face recognition impairments. Through this screening process, we identified AW, an otherwise normal 19-year-old female, who was then tested in the lab on face and object recognition tests. AW's performance was impaired in within-class visual recognition memory across six different visual categories (guns, horses, scenes, tools, doors, and cars). In contrast, she scored normally on seven tests of face recognition, tests of memory for two other object categories (houses and glasses), and tests of recall memory for visual shapes. Testing confirmed that her impairment was not related to a general deficit in lower-level perception, object perception, basic-level recognition, or memory. AW's results provide the first neuropsychological evidence that recognition memory for non-face visual object categories can be selectively impaired in individuals without brain damage or other memory impairment. These results indicate that the development of recognition memory for faces does not depend on intact object recognition memory and provide further evidence for category-specific dissociations in visual recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '21'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2010.04.009,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Neuropsychological evaluation included Wechsler and Kaufman intelligence scales, a test of word fluency, digit span, Corsi block, California verbal learning, Trail making, Benton facial recognition, Snoodgrass object recognition tests, Rivermead face learning subtest, and developmental test of visual perception. The ADI-R was used to show current and retrospective diagnosis of autistic disorder. Neuroimagery included brain MRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and PET. Brain MRI showed a right occipital defect and an abnormal hyperintensity of the right temporal cortex. PET and SPECT disclosed a left frontal hypometabolism together with the right occipital defect. Neuropsychological testing showed a visual apperceptive agnosia and executive function deficits. Psychiatric study confirmed the diagnosis of autistic disorder.

However, the middle and late components were delayed and slowed. These results and others in the literature suggest that the neocortex in man, as in other mammals, plays an essential role in the temporal aspects of hearing.

17354375,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn

Her elementary sensory functions were preserved and she performed in the normal range on visual matching tasks, on taks requiring to detect small differences between similar complex shapes and in copying drawings, without any evidence of a line by line approach. Her deficit emerged with tests that, though not implying identification of meaning, demanded to disentangle a form from a confused background and to achieve a highly structured description of the stimulus. In addition to this high-level perceptual processing disorder, there was a deficit in recovering from the visual store the shape of an object, also when the performance did not involve perceptual discrimination, e.g., in drawing from memory or telling the physical difference between two named stimuli.

Introducing this approach in face perception research showed that the performance pattern of a brain-damaged patient with acquired prosopagnosia (PS) in a face matching task was reversed, as compared to normal observers: the patient showed almost no further decrease of performance when only one facial part (eye, mouth, nose, etc.) was available at a time (foveal window condition, forcing part-based analysis), but a very large impairment when the fixated part was selectively masked (mask condition, promoting holistic perception) (Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Busigny, & Rossion, 2010a; Van Belle, De Graef, Verfaillie, Rossion, & Lefèvre, 2010b). Here we tested the same manipulation in a recently reported case of pure prosopagnosia (GG) with unilateral right hemisphere damage (Busigny, Joubert, Felician, Ceccaldi, & Rossion, 2010). Contrary to normal observers, GG was also significantly more impaired with a mask than with a window, demonstrating impairment with holistic face perception. Together with our previous study, these observations support a generalized account of acquired prosopagnosia as a critical impairment of holistic (individual) face perception, implying that this function is a key element of normal human face recognition. Furthermore, the similar behavioral pattern of the two patients despite different lesion localizations supports a distributed network view of the neural face processing structures, suggesting that the key function of human face processing, namely holistic perception of individual faces, requires the activity of several brain areas of the right hemisphere and their mutual connectivity.","DictElement({'Year': '2011', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '23'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2011,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.010,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Perceptual abnormalities have been reported in single cases or small series, but the causal link of such deficits to prosopagnosia is unclear. Our goal was to identify candidate perceptual processes that might contribute to prosopagnosia, by subjecting several prosopagnosic patients to a battery of functions that may be necessary for accurate facial perception. We tested seven prosopagnosic patients. Three had unilateral right occipitotemporal lesions, two had bilateral posterior occipitotemporal lesions, and one had right anterior-to-occipital temporal damage along with a small left temporal lesion. These lesions all included the fusiform face area, in contrast to one patient with bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Most patients had impaired performance on face-matching tests and difficulty with subcategory judgments for non-face objects. The most consistent deficits in patients with lesions involving the fusiform face area were impaired perception of spatial relations in dot patterns and reduced contrast sensitivity in the 4 to 8 cycles deg(-1) range. Patients with bilateral lesions were impaired in saturation discrimination. Luminance discrimination was normal in all but two patients, and spatial resolution was uniformly spared. Curvature and line-orientation discrimination were impaired in only one patient, who also had the most difficulty with more basic-level object recognition. We conclude that deficits in luminance, spatial resolution, curvature, line orientation, and contrast at low spatial frequencies are unlikely to contribute to apperceptive prosopagnosia. More relevant may be contrast sensitivity at higher spatial frequencies and the analysis of object spatial structure. Deficits in these functions may impair perception of subtle variations in object shape, and may be one mechanism by which the recognition defect in prosopagnosia can extend to other classes of object subcategorization.",{},,Perception,10.1068/p5243,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

Rehabilitation consisting of non-specific attention tasks and repetitions of words reaching only the right ear was undertaken 15 months after the stroke. The oral language comprehension improved, as did the left hemisphere activation, and the extinction phenomena disappeared, except for the auditory one. The unilaterality of the auditory agnosia could be due, in part, to a peculiar physiological processing in this patient, such as poor performance of his right ipsilateral auditory pathway which could be improved with practice.

Unlike control subjects, he made fewer errors identifying silhouettes compared to line drawings with internal details. These alterations, together with his feature-by-feature descriptions of objects and copying, suggest that his agnosia was due to a disturbance in integrating local form features, as described by Riddoch and Humphreys (1987). This interpretation is supported by the findings that his tactile recognition and semantic and structural knowledge of the objects he could not identify visually were intact. Furthermore, his deficient performance in categorical matching of photographs to objects was dependent upon the perceptual complexity of the photographs. Similar deficits in early form processing described by other investigators are discussed.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80330-9,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

Analysis of visual function indicated that the recognition failures resulted from an agnosia, rather than elemental visual impairment. Whereas his impairment of gesture recognition appeared to be related to an associative agnosia, his inability to recognize objects was related to an apperceptive agnosia. There may be four subtypes of apperceptive agnosia: one where the internal object representations or structural descriptions are impaired, another where an adequate percept cannot be derived, a third where the internal referent and percept are dissociated, and a fourth where both levels are impaired. Our patient demonstrated a failure to relate individual elements to the whole, a failure to integrate multiple elements, and a reliance on global perception. He had normal object imagery. These results suggest that, whereas internal representations were intact, he was unable to form adequate perceptual representations.",{},,Brain and cognition,10.1006/brcg.1994.1019,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",United States,eng

1486552,Parallel pattern processing and visual agnosia.,"Humphreys, G W; Riddoch, M J; Quinlan, P T; Price, C J; Donnelly, N",Humphreys,"A series of visual search experiments are reported examining pattern processing in a visual agnosic patient. We examined search for targets defined by: (I) the combination of their features relative to homogeneous distractors; (2) the combination of their features relative to heterogeneous distractors; and (3) a single feature difference relative to the distractors (their orientation). Normal subjects demonstrate evidence of spatially parallel search when combined-feature targets are detected against homogeneous distractors, and when targets are defined by a salient feature difference. There are non-linear effects of the number of distractors present, and absent responses can be as fast as present. In contrast, search times for combined-feature targets amongst heterogeneous distractors increase linearly with display size, with the slope for absent responses about twice that for present. The contrast between search for combined-feature targets amongst homogeneous and heterogeneous distractors can be attributed to the effects of grouping between distractors and between distractors and targets (Duncan & Humphreys, 1989, 1992; Humphreys & Muller, in press). Grouping between homogeneous distractors facilitates search. An agnosic patient, HJA, showed normal search functions for single-feature targets and for combined-feature targets amongst heterogeneous distractors. However, he was impaired at search for combined-feature targets amongst homogeneous distractors. This suggests that HJA is selectively impaired at grouping conjunctions of form features. The relations between HJA's agnosia and his problem in the parallel grouping of form conjunctions are discussed, as are the implications of the work for understanding normal vision.",{},,Canadian journal of psychology,10.1037/h0084329,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Canada,eng

The disorder was also dependent upon the frame of reference (allocentric versus egocentric) activated on the basis of task demands.

Voice recognition has been shown to evoke a distributed network of brain regions that includes, in addition to the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the anterior temporal pole, fusiform face area (FFA), and posterior cingulate gyrus (pCG). Here we report an individual (MS) with acquired prosopagnosia who, despite bilateral damage to much of this network, demonstrates the ability to distinguish voices of several well-known acquaintances from voices of people that he has never heard before. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed that, relative to speech-modulated noise, voices rated as familiar and unfamiliar by MS elicited enhanced haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus, left posterior STS, and posterior midline brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal pCG. More interestingly, relative to noise and unfamiliar voices, the familiar voices elicited greater haemodynamic activity in the left angular gyrus and medial parietal regions including the dorsal pCG and precuneus. The findings are consistent with theories implicating the pCG in recognizing people who are personally familiar, and furthermore suggest that the pCG region of the voice identification network is able to make functional contributions to voice recognition even though other areas of the network, namely the anterior temporal poles, FFA, and the right parietal lobe, may be compromised.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x246131,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

In addition, she could not indicate whether the lights in a room were switched on or off, nor was she able to differentiate between normal greyscale images and inverted greyscale images. As the patient recognised objects, colours, and shapes correctly, the impairment is specific for brightness. As low-level, sensory processing is normal, this specific deficit in the recognition and appreciation of brightness appears to be of a higher, cognitive level, the level of semantic knowledge.

The patient with the right posterior lesion could not recognize handwriting, was prosopagnosic and topographagnosic, but had no difficulty in reading, lipreading, or in recognizing stylized drawings. The apparent double dissociation of function demonstrates the presence of two different visual processing mechanisms which are very probably peculiar to the visual system of the left hemisphere in the one case and to that of the right hemisphere in the other.

In most cases, recognition is not impaired.

An explanation in terms of a visuosensory deficit (i.e., Funktionswandel) that affects the perception of specific stimulus categories has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we report two patients (MZ and CM) who experienced hemi-metamorphopsia for faces after a stroke in the posterior part of the brain. Despite the distortions, they could still match and recognize faces. We carried out a detailed evaluation of their visual-sensory status and found that both MZ and CM had specific problems with discriminating and estimating sizes and shapes, especially in the contralesional visual field. It was concluded that these cases, metamorphopsia was not due to a higher-order perception impairment specific for faces, but rather of a specific impairment in shape perception in the contralesional visual field that proportionally affects the perception of faces.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x256563,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Specifically, we studied activations to sound embedded in a block design using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after application of anodal tDCS to the right auditory cortex. Before tDCS, auditory discrimination deficits were associated with abnormally reduced activations of the auditory cortex and bilateral unresponsiveness of the anterior superior temporal sulci and gyri.

2004260,Multiple representations contribute to body knowledge processing. Evidence from a case of autotopagnosia.,"Sirigu, A; Grafman, J; Bressler, K; Sunderland, T",Sirigu,"Body schema disturbances were studied in a 62-yr-old woman with Alzheimer's disease. She was severely impaired in verbal and nonverbal tasks requiring her to localize body parts (on her own body, the examiner's body or a doll's body) even though she correctly named the same parts when pointed at by the examiner. Pointing responses were misdirected mainly to parts contiguous with the target area and, to a lesser extent, to functionally equivalent body parts. We also found that the patient was able to define body part names functionally but not spatially. In another series of tasks, and in contrast to the above results, performances were normal when small objects, attached to the patient's body, served as pointing targets. Furthermore, on subsequent testing she pointed correctly at the remembered position of these objects. The fact that the same point in 'body space' is localized correctly when it corresponds to an external object and erroneously when it corresponds to a body part contradicts the idea of the body schema as a unitary function. Learning the position of objects on the body surface requires access to some form of body-reference system on which this information can be mapped. We argue that such a system can be available in autotopagnosia and is independent from the visuospatial representations of the body structure that are postulated to be damaged or inaccessible in this syndrome. An integrated account of the present results and of those reported by other authors suggests that multiple levels of representation (e.g., sensorimotor, visuospatial, semantic) are involved in the organization of body knowledge.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/114.1.629,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",England,eng

Comprehensive follow-up examinations of auditory function were periodically conducted until his sudden death 15 years later. His brain was studied postmortem for neuropathology. Initial pure-tone audiometry revealed moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and mild sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. However, repeated pure-tone audiometry revealed that thresholds became progressively poorer over time, bilaterally. Speech audiometry of both ears consistently revealed that the patient was unable to discriminate any monosyllabic words (i.e. speech intelligibility scores were 0%, bilaterally). In general, speech and hearing tests demonstrated that he could not comprehend spoken words, but could comprehend written commands and gestures. Postmortem neuropathological study of the left hemisphere revealed total defect and neuronal loss of the superior temporal gyrus, including Heschl's gyrus, and total gliosis of the medial geniculate body. In the right hemisphere, examination revealed subcortical necrosis, gliosis in the centre of the superior temporal gyrus and partial gliosis of the medial geniculate body. The pathological examination supports clinical results in which the patient's imperception of speech sounds, music and environmental sounds could be caused by progressive degeneration of bilateral medial geniculate bodies.",{},,Acta oto-laryngologica,10.1080/000164800750001053,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

Diffusion-weighted imaging indicated status epilepticus, not stroke. His deficits resolved immediately after treatment with diazepam and phenytoin sodium. Case 2, a 61-year-old man with a history of brain infarcts in the right lateral temporal and left medial temporo-occipital lobes, suddenly developed global aphasia and cortical deafness. An MRI revealed no new lesions, including infarcts. An EEG revealed lateralized periodic discharges in the left temporo-parieto-occipital area, and single-photon emission computed tomography revealed a transient high-uptake lesion in the left temporoparietal lobes, indicating status epilepticus.

It is unique in that the clinical picture began with generalized auditory agnosia for verbal and nonverbal sounds and changed, over a period of two months, to a restricted auditory agnosia, confined to the recognition of nonverbal sounds. The lesions, confirmed by CT scanning and MRI, were subcortical bilaterally, without evidence of cortical damage, and have not previously been described. The results of audiological studies on temporal discrimination were similar to those described for bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The relationships between click intervals and the threshold to detect sound, and between numbers of clicks and the threshold, were also examined. We observed a tendency for the threshold to decline as the number of clicks was increased or the interval between two clicks was shortened. These phenomena are similar to temporal summation in cellular neurophysiology and we speculate that this phenomenon is an important factor in the auditory disturbances shown by the present case.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/109.3.379,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

For vowel classification, both superior temporal plane (STP) and STS areas have been suggested relevant. Lesion of bilateral STS may conversely be expected to cause pure word deafness and possibly also impaired vowel classification. Here we studied a patient with bilateral STS lesions caused by ischemic strokes and relatively intact medial STPs to characterize the behavioral consequences of STS loss. The patient showed severe deficits in auditory speech perception, whereas his speech production was fluent and communication by written speech was grossly intact. Auditory-evoked fields in the STP were within normal limits on both sides, suggesting that major parts of the auditory cortex were functionally intact. Further studies showed that the patient had normal hearing thresholds and only mild disability in tests for telencephalic hearing disorder. Prominent deficits were discovered in an auditory-object classification task, where the patient performed four standard deviations below the control group. In marked contrast, performance in a vowel-classification task was intact. Auditory evoked fields showed enhanced responses for vowels compared to matched non-vowels within normal limits. Our results are consistent with the notion that cortex along STS is important for auditory speech perception, although it does not appear to be entirely speech specific. Formant analysis and single vowel classification, however, appear to be already implemented in auditory cortex on the STP.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.08.001,,Auditory agnosia; Auditory cortex; Pure word deafness; Speech perception; Superior temporal sulcus; Vowel,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

They also show a complementary dissociation of the analysis of handwritten text. The patient with the right posterior stroke can read it but not recognize whose handwriting it is; the patient with the left posterior stroke cannot read the text but knows who wrote it. The analysis of spatial vision revealed that the prosopagnosic patient has no problem with seeing texture elements when presented in isolation. Yet she performs poorly with Moiré and texture perception, i.e. she suffers from a selective loss of global visual perception. The alexic patient performs well with Moiré patterns but neither with (complex) texture elements nor with textures. She seemingly can locally and globally process patterns composed of simple figural elements but fails with stimuli that require the integration of features. This finding of a concomitant dissociation of local and global visual processes in the two patients supports the view that prosopagnosia as well as alexia are the most conspicuous aspects of more general alterations of visual perception.",{},,Vision research,10.1016/0042-6989(94)90045-0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Her hearing abilities are normal, and an MRI scan showed no evidence of brain damage in regions associated with voice or auditory perception. To better understand her condition and to assess models of voice and high-level auditory processing, we tested KH on behavioural tasks measuring voice recognition, recognition of vocal emotions, face recognition, speech perception, and processing of environmental sounds and music. KH was impaired on tasks requiring the recognition of famous voices and the learning and recognition of new voices. In contrast, she performed well on nearly all other tasks. Her case is the first report of developmental phonagnosia, and the results suggest that the recognition of a speaker's vocal identity depends on separable mechanisms from those used to recognize other information from the voice or non-vocal auditory stimuli.","DictElement({'Year': '2008', 'Month': '08', 'Day': '13'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2008,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.08.003,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
28926418,Hemispheric Dominance for Stereognosis in a Patient With an Infarct of the Left Postcentral Sensory Hand Area.,"Moll, Jorge; de Oliveira-Souza, Ricardo",Moll,"The concept of left hemispheric dominance for praxis, speech, and language has been one of the pillars of neurology since the mid-19th century. In 1906, Hermann Oppenheim reported a patient with bilateral stereoagnosia (astereognosis) caused by a left parietal lobe tumor and proposed that the left hemisphere was also dominant for stereognosis. Surprisingly, few cases of bilateral stereoagnosia caused by a unilateral cerebral lesion have been documented in the literature since then. Here we report a 75-year-old right-handed man who developed bilateral stereoagnosia after suffering a small infarct in the crown of the left postcentral gyrus. He could not recognize objects with either hand, but retained the ability to localize stimuli applied to the palm of his left (ipsilesional) hand. He was severely disabled in ordinary activities requiring the use of his hands. The lesion corresponded to Brodmann area 1, where probabilistic anatomic, functional, and electrophysiologic studies have located one of the multiple somatosensory representations of the hand. The lesion was in a strategic position to interrupt both the processing of afferent tactile information issuing from the primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a and 3b) and the forward higher-order processing in area 2, the secondary sensory cortex, and the contralateral area 1. The lesion also deprived the motor hand area of its afferent regulation from the sensory hand area (grasping), while leaving intact the visuomotor projections from the occipital cortex (reaching). Our patient supports Oppenheim's proposal that the left postcentral gyrus of some individuals is dominant for stereognosis.",{},,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,10.1097/WNN.0000000000000135,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Comparing faces to non-face objects elicited activation in all visual areas of the cortical face processing network that were spared subsequent to brain damage. The common brain lesion in the two patients was in the right inferior occipital cortex, in the territory of the right ""occipital face area"" ('OFA'), which strengthens the critical role of this region in processing faces. Despite the lesion to the right 'OFA', there was normal range of sensitivity to faces in the right ""fusiform face area"" ('FFA') in both patients, supporting a non-hierarchical model of face processing at the cortical level. At the same time, however, sensitivity to individual face representations, as indicated by release from adaptation to identity, was abnormal in the right 'FFA' of both patients. This suggests that the right 'OFA' is necessary to individualize faces, perhaps through reentrant interactions with other cortical face sensitive areas. The lateral occipital area (LO) is damaged bilaterally in patient DF, who also shows visual object agnosia. However, in patient PS, in whom LO was spared, sensitivity to individual representations of non-face objects was still found in this region, as in the normal brain, consistent with her preserved object recognition abilities. Taken together, these observations, which fruitfully combine functional imaging and neuropsychology, place strong constraints on the possible functional organization of the cortical areas mediating face processing in the human brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2009', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2009,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.005,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.05.017,,Body recognition; Body-related disorders; Heterotopagnosia; Self-other distinction; Stroke; Virtual reality,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

Prior to application of EMFs four of these patients' drawings showed distortions, poor perspectives, impoverished facial expression, and lack of attention to details suggesting poor body image perception related to right posterior hemispheric dysfunction. In response to the administration of EMFs the group demonstrated improvement in motor disability which was associated with a striking improvement in the drawing particularly the drawings of the face the perception of which is localized to the right parietal lobe.

During singing familiar nursery songs, the patient showed the replacement of one phrase of the melody. In MRI, the patient had old infarction in the anterior portion of the temporal lobes bilaterally. In conclusion, the anterior temporal lobes participate in the perception and expression of music. During singing, the song is retrieved from long-term memory by a unit of one phrase. The dysfunction of that retrieval caused the replacement of the succeeding phrases of the original with the wrong tune, and we named this phenomenon paramelodia.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70180-1,,,Case Reports; Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,Italy,eng
10865099,Neuronal representation of object orientation.,"Karnath, H O; Ferber, S; Bülthoff, H H",Karnath,"The dissociation between object identity and object orientation observed in six patients with brain damage, has been taken as evidence for a view-invariant model of object recognition. However, there was also some indication that these patients were not generally agnosic for object orientation but were able to gain access to at least some information about objects' canonical upright. We studied a new case (KB) with spared knowledge of object identity and impaired perception of object orientation using a forced choice paradigm to contrast directly the patient's ability to perceive objects' canonical upright vs non-upright orientations. We presented 2D-pictures of objects with unambiguous canonical upright orientations in four different orientations (0 degrees, -90 degrees, +90 degrees, 180 degrees ). KB showed no impairment in identifying letters, objects, animals, or faces irrespective of their given orientation. Also, her knowledge of upright orientation of stimuli was perfectly preserved. In sharp contrast, KB was not able to judge the orientation when the stimuli were presented in a non-upright orientation. The findings give further support for a distributed view-based representation of objects in which neurons become tuned to the features present in certain views of an object. Since we see more upright than inverted animals and familiar objects, the statistics of these images leads to a larger number of neurons tuned for objects in an upright orientation. We suppose that probably for this reason KB's knowledge of upright orientation was found to be more robust against neuronal damage than knowledge of other orientations.",{},,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/s0028-3932(00)00043-9,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
7497101,Anosognosia in parietal lobe syndrome.,"Ramachandran, V S",Ramachandran,"Patients with right parietal lesions often deny their paralysis (anosognosia), but do they have ""tacit"" knowledge of their paralysis? I devised three novel tests to explore this. First, the patients were given a choice between a bimanual task (e.g., tying shoe laces) vs a unimanual one (e.g., threading a bolt). They chose the former on 17 of 18 trials and, surprisingly, showed no frustration or learning despite repeated failed attempts. I conclude that they have no tacit knowledge of paralysis (or, if such knowledge exists, it is not available for this particular task). Second, I used a ""virtual reality box"" to convey the optical illusion to the patient that she was moving her paralyzed left hand up and down to the rhythm of a metronome, and yet she showed no sign of surprise. Third, I irrigated patient BM's left ear canal with cold water, a procedure that is known to shift that patient's spatial frame of reference by stimulating the vestibular system. Surprisingly, this allowed her ""repressed"" memory of the paralysis to come to the surface; she said she had been paralyzed continuously for several days. I suggest that the vestibular stimulation produces these remarkable effects by mimicking REM sleep. These patients also employ a whole arsenal of grossly exaggerated Freudian ""defense mechanisms"" to account for their paralysis. To explain this, I propose that in normal individuals the left hemisphere ordinarily deals with small, local anomalies by trying to impose consistency but, when the anomaly exceeds threshold, an interaction with the right hemisphere forces a ""paradigm shift."" A failure of this process, in patients with right hemisphere damage, might partially account for anosognosia. Finally, I present a new conceptual framework that may help link several psychological and neurological phenomena such as Freudian defense mechanisms, vestibular stimulation, anosognosia, memory repression, visual illusions, anterograde amnesia, REM sleep, dreaming, and humor.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1006/ccog.1995.1002,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",United States,eng

This controversy is complicated by the fact that, on close examination, agnosic patients do tend to have some perceptual difficulties. Thus the issue centres around the question as to whether these deficits play a causal part in the aetiology of agnosia or whether they are functionally independent, with both impairments resulting from the substantial cerebral lesions involved in agnosia. In 1956, Ettlinger published a study in which he compared the performance of patients with visual recognition deficits and patients with posterior brain lesions whose recognition abilities were intact. He argued that visual perceptual problems could not explain the recognition deficit in agnosia as he saw far worse perceptual impairments in patients who did not experience any problems in visual recognition. Although the logic of Ettlinger's argument is not disputed, some criticisms have arisen concerning the study, such as the fact that his experimental group did not include a truly object agnosic patient. In addition, Ettlinger's visual-sensory assessment can no longer be considered comprehensive in the light of present day knowledge of the cerebral visual apparatus. This study therefore investigated three (prosop)agnosic patients and five patients with unilateral brain lesions without recognition deficits on an extensive battery of visual sensory tests. The results support Ettlinger's original claim that (in some cases) agnosia cannot be explained as resulting from lower level visual impairments.",{},,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",10.1136/jnnp.58.3.350,PMC1073375,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Nonetheless, there is a shortcoming in research and availability of applicable trainings. Further, to date, anosognosia for limb apraxia has largely been neglected. Therefore, we developed a <i>Naturalistic Action Therapy</i> that trains object selection and application with an errorless learning approach and which includes supported self-evaluation. The current study presents the results of two stroke patients participating in the training. The procedure entailed two baseline and one post-training sessions including standardized limb apraxia and anosognosia assessments as well as 18 naturalistic action tasks. The training consisted of 15 sessions during which 4-6 of the 18 naturalistic action tasks (e.g., pour water into a glass, make a phone call) were trained. Both patients showed improvement in trained and untrained tasks as well as in standardized apraxia and anosognosia assessments. Training effects appeared strongest for the trained items. The procedure is documented in detail and easy to administer and thus may have the potential to be applied by relatives. The results of this pilot-study are promising and suggest that the approach is suitable for further evaluation.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neuropsychological rehabilitation,10.1080/09602011.2019.1628075,,Anosognosia for apraxia; Naturalistic Action Therapy; limb apraxia; rehabilitation; tool-use,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

17565219,A case of auditory agnosia with impairment of perception and expression of music: cognitive processing of tonality.,"Satoh, Masayuki; Takeda, Katsuhiko; Kuzuhara, Shigeki",Satoh,"There is fairly general agreement that the melody and the rhythm are the independent components of the perception of music. In the theory of music, the melody and harmony determine to which tonality the music belongs. It remains an unsettled question whether the tonality is also an independent component of the perception of music, or a by-product of the melody and harmony. We describe a patient with auditory agnosia and expressive amusia that developed after a bilateral infarction of the temporal lobes. We carried out a detailed examination of musical ability in the patient and in control subjects. Comparing with a control population, we identified the following impairments in music perception: (a) discrimination of familiar melodies; (b) discrimination of unfamiliar phrases, and (c) discrimination of isolated chords. His performance in pitch discrimination and tonality were within normal limits. Although intrasubject statistical analysis revealed significant difference only between tonality task and unfamiliar phrase performance, comparison with control subjects suggested a dissociation between a preserved tonality analysis and impairment of perception of melody and chords. By comparing the results of our patient with those in the literature, we may say that there is a double dissociation between the tonality and the other components. Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose that tonality is an independent component of music perception. Based on our present and previous studies, we proposed the revised version of the cognitive model of musical processing in the brain.","DictElement({'Year': '2007', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2007,European neurology,10.1159/000103640,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Switzerland,eng

We present evidence suggesting that the same dissociation between perception and action is evident in the visual processing of object shape. In other words, discrimination between objects on the basis of their shape appears to be mediated by visual mechanisms that are functionally and neurally distinct from those controlling the pre-shaping of the hand during grasping movements directed at those same objects. We studied two patients with lesions in different parts of the cerebral visual pathways. One patient (RV), who had sustained bilateral lesions of the occipitoparietal cortex, was unable to use visual information to place her fingers correctly on the circumference of irregularly shaped objects when asked to pick them up, even though she had no difficulty in visually discriminating one such object from another. Conversely, a second patient (DF), who had bilateral damage in the ventrolateral occipital region, had no difficulty in placing her fingers on appropriate opposition points during grasping, even though she was unable to discriminate visually amongst such objects. This double dissociation lends strong support to the idea that the visual mechanisms mediating the perception of objects are functionally and neurally distinct from those mediating the control of skilled actions directed at those objects. It also supports the recent proposal of Goodale and Milner that visual perception depends on a ventral stream of projections from the primary visual cortex to the inferotemporal cortex, whereas the visual control of skilled actions depends on a dorsal stream from the primary visual cortex to the posterior parietal cortex.",{},,Current biology : CB,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00132-9,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Our findings, together with other reports on domain-specific dissociations and functional brain imaging studies, provide evidence to support the view that visual perception and visual mental imagery are subserved by independent functional mechanisms, which do not share the same cortical implementation.

Those are the obvious symptoms of a cerebral infarction. However, less visible but burdensome consequences may go unnoticed without closer investigation. The importance of a thorough clinical examination is exemplified by a single case study of a 72-year-old, right-handed male. Two years before he had suffered from an ischemic stroke in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery, with right homonymous hemianopia and global alexia (i.e., impairment in letter recognition and profound impairment of reading) without agraphia. Naming was impaired on visual presentation (20%-39% correct), but improved significantly after tactile presentation (87% correct) or verbal definition (89%). Pre-semantic visual processing was normal (correct matching of different views of the same object), as was his access to structural knowledge from vision (he reliably distinguished real objects from non-objects). On a colour decision task he reliably indicated which of two items was coloured correctly. Though he was unable to mime how visually presented objects were used, he more reliably matched pictures of objects with pictures of a mime artist gesturing the use of the object. He obtained normal scores on word definition (WAIS-III), synonym judgment and word-picture matching tasks with perceptual and semantic distractors. He however failed when he had to match physically dissimilar specimens of the same object or when he had to decide which two of five objects were related associatively (Pyramids and Palm Trees Test). The patient thus showed a striking contrast in his intact ability to access knowledge of object shape or colour from vision and impaired functional and associative knowledge. As a result, he could not access a complete semantic representation, required for activating phonological representations to name visually presented objects. The pattern of impairments and preserved abilities is considered to be a specific difficulty to access a full semantic representation from an intact structural representation of visually presented objects, i.e., a form of visual object agnosia.",{},,Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie,,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Netherlands,dut

These movements were significantly more accurate than volitional movements for the left but not right hand. CW also exhibited preserved motor imagery for the left but not right hand. Consistent with previous accounts, these findings suggest that motor imagery may normally involve the inhibition of movements. CW's unawareness of movements during motor imagery may reflect inattention or misattribution of the unexpected sensory feedback. Furthermore, in line with current models of motor control, motor imagery may depend on the integrity of a ""forward model"" derived from motor outflow information to generate a prediction of the consequences of a motor command. Such predictions appear to be preserved for imagery of left but not right hand movements in CW. Action may additionally depend on precise updating of effector position derived from the comparison of predicted and actual sensory information.

However, it is still unclear whether the retinal separation or the physical (post-size-constancy) spatial separation is critical. Here, we presented various hierarchical global/local letter stimuli at different viewing distances and sizes to separate the impacts of retinal versus physical size. Our findings indicate a key role for visual angle in determining simultanagnosic perception. We observed that not only retinal spacing (in terms of visual angle) between local elements had a major impact on global perception in simultanagnosia, but also the physical size of the separation between local elements, provided that binocular cues to viewing distance were available. The results indicate both pre-size-constancy retinal influences and binocular-post-constancy influences upon conscious perception in simultanagnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2010', 'Month': '02', 'Day': '16'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2010,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.02.013,PMC2877877,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
1406994,Dissociation between mental imagery and object recognition in a brain-damaged patient.,"Behrmann, M; Winocur, G; Moscovitch, M",Behrmann,"Visual imagery is the creation of mental representations that share many features with veridical visual percepts. Studies of normal and brain-damaged people reinforce the view that visual imagery and visual perception are mediated by a common neural substrate and activate the same representations. Thus, brain-damaged patients with intact vision who have an impairment in perception should have impaired visual imagery. Here we present evidence to the contrary from a patient with severely impaired object recognition (visual object agnosia) but with normal mental imagery. He draws objects in considerable detail from memory and uses information derived from mental images in a variety of tasks. In contrast, he cannot identify visually presented objects, even those he has drawn himself. He has normal visual acuity and intact perception of equally complex material in other domains. We conclude that rich internal representations can be activated to support visual imagery even when they cannot support visually mediated perception of objects.",{},,Nature,10.1038/359636a0,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Given the recent suggestion that right (frontal) systems are selectively involved in negative emotions, it might be claimed that anosognosia results from a disruption in negative emotions. This is not consistent with the finding that some anosognosic patients exhibit substantial fluctuations in emotion, including the experience of negative emotions such as sadness. The present study investigates a patient (IW) with a right convexity lesion and anosognosia. He reported being frequently overcome by powerful emotions, especially sadness. IW was assessed on a self-report emotion questionnaire, where his reports were typically of higher levels of emotion than the control group. He was also assessed on the more indirect measure of Affective Story Recall. Here his pattern of emotional experience was similar to that of two control groups, one of which consisted of non-anosognosic patients with hemiparesis. His performance on Story Recall was notable in that he directed his emotions to a different 'object' to that of controls (other vs. self, respectively).

However, these two pathways also communicate to share much visual information. These dorso-ventral interactions have been studied using form-from-motion (FfM) stimuli, revealing that FfM perception first activates dorsal regions (e.g., MT+/V5), followed by successive activations of ventral regions (e.g., LOC). However, relatively little is known about the implications of focal brain damage of visual areas on these dorso-ventral interactions. In the present case report, we investigated the dynamics of dorsal and ventral activations related to FfM perception (using topographical ERP analysis and electrical source imaging) in a patient suffering from a deficit in FfM perception due to right extrastriate brain damage in the ventral stream. Despite the patient's FfM impairment, both successful (observed for the highest level of FfM signal) and absent/failed FfM perception evoked the same temporal sequence of three processing states observed previously in healthy subjects. During the first period, brain source localization revealed cortical activations along the dorsal stream, currently associated with preserved elementary motion processing. During the latter two periods, the patterns of activity differed from normal subjects: activations were observed in the ventral stream (as reported for normal subjects), but also in the dorsal pathway, with the strongest and most sustained activity localized in the parieto-occipital regions. On the other hand, absent/failed FfM perception was characterized by weaker brain activity, restricted to the more lateral regions. This study shows that in the present case report, successful FfM perception, while following the same temporal sequence of processing steps as in normal subjects, evoked different patterns of brain activity. By revealing a brain circuit involving the most rostral part of the dorsal pathway, this study provides further support for neuro-imaging studies and brain lesion investigations that have suggested the existence of different brain circuits associated with different profiles of interaction between the dorsal and the ventral streams.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '06', 'Day': '18'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,Brain structure & function,10.1007/s00429-016-1245-6,,Brain lesion; EEG; Form-from-motion; Perceptual deficit,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Germany,eng
7583104,The McCollough effect reveals orientation discrimination in a case of cortical blindness.,"Humphrey, G K; Goodale, M A; Corbetta, M; Aglioti, S",Humphrey,"The McCollough effect is a colour after-effect that is contingent on the orientation of the patterns used to induce it. To produce the effect, two differently oriented grating patterns--such as a red-and-black vertical grating and a green-and-black horizontal grating--are viewed alternatively for a few minutes. After this period of adaptation, if the black-and-white test gratings are viewed in the same orientation as the adaptation patterns, the white sections of the vertical grating will appear pale green and the white sections of the horizontal grating will appear pink. The McCollough effect indicates that colour- and orientation-coding mechanisms interact at some point during visual processing; but the question remains as to whether this interaction occurs at an early or later stage in the cortical visual pathways. In an attempt to answer this question, we studied a patient who had suffered extensive damage to extrastriate visual areas of the brain, which had left him able to see colour but little else. Neuropsychological and perceptual tests demonstrated that the patient, P.B., has a profound impairment in form perception and is even unable to discriminate between 90 degrees differences in the orientation of grating stimuli. He is also unable to use orientation information to control his reaching or grasping. Nevertheless, P.B. can name and discriminate different colours reliably, including those used to induce the McCollough effect. After adaptation with red-and-green gratings, P.B. appropriately reported the orientation-contingent aftereffect colours, even though he continued to be unable to discriminate the orientations of the test patterns. These results indicate that at some level in P.B.'s visual system orientation is being coded, but it is at a level that he is unable to use in making orientation judgements or in visuomotor control. Given the massive insult to the extrastriate cortex in P.B., it is likely that the anatomical locus of the mechanisms underlying the McCollough effect is within primary visual cortex or even earlier in the visual pathway.",{},,Current biology : CB,10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00107-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

Following a series of cerebral infarcts, patient DB presented with severe perceptual impairment, including dense apperceptive agnosia,prosopagnosia, and topographical agnosia. Despite these deficits, he could effortlessly name countries from their outline maps. Patient WH, who suffered from semantic dementia, had severe naming and comprehension difficulties, with extremely sparse residual semantic knowledge. Remarkably, the category of countries was preserved. First, we argue that, for both patients, this category preservation occurs at a semantic level. Second, we discuss our findings in the context of three current models of category-specific effects (perceptual, ontogenetic, and evolutionary models). We argue that the perceptual model (Humphreys and colleagues) cannot easily accommodate our findings. By contrast, the ontogenetic (Warrington and colleagues) and evolutionary models (Caramazza and colleagues) can explain our findings. However, some modifications to both models are required. The ontogenetic model needs to envisage a spatial channel for the development of map knowledge, which is anatomically separate from channels of other categories of knowledge. The evolutionary model needs to envisage the possibility that some categories of knowledge, such as countries, may not be prewired, but learned during ontogenetic development.",{},,Neurocase,10.1080/13554790490495186,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A neuropsychological test battery revealed lower than normal scores for executive functions, attention and memory, consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction. The recent onset of fire-setting behavior and the chronic nature of the lacunar lesion, together with an unremarkable performance on tests measuring executive functions two years prior, suggested a causal relationship between this organic brain lesion and the fire-setting behavior.

In contrast, Herschel's lateral occipital complex showed normal activation to objects. Behaviourally, Herschel is severely impaired with the recognition of familiar faces, discrimination between unfamiliar identities, and the perception of facial expression and gender. Notably, his visual recognition deficits are largely restricted to faces, suggesting that the damaged mechanisms are face-specific. He showed normal recognition memory for a wide variety of object classes in several paradigms, normal ability to discriminate between highly similar items within a novel object category, and intact ability to name basic objects (except four-legged animals). Furthermore, Herschel displayed a normal face composite effect and typical global advantage and global interference effects in the Navon task, suggesting spared integration of both face and nonface information. Nevertheless, he failed visual closure tests requiring recognition of basic objects from degraded images.

The deficit is termed 'simultanagnosia' and has been discussed in the context of restricted visual working memory and impaired visuo-spatial attention. Recent observations indicated that the recognition of global shapes can be modulated by the spatial distance between individual objects in patients with simultanagnosia and thus is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon depending on spatial continuity. However, grouping mechanisms not only require the spatial integration of visual information, but also involve integration processes over time. The present study investigated motion-defined integration mechanisms in two patients with simultanagnosia. We applied hierarchical organized stimuli of global objects that consisted of coherently moving dots ('shape-from-motion'). In addition, we tested the patients' ability to recognize biological motion by presenting characteristic human movements ('point-light-walker'). The data revealed largely preserved perception of biological motion, while the perception of motion-defined shapes was impaired. Our findings suggest separate mechanisms underlying the recognition of biological motion and shapes defined by coherently moving dots. They thus argue against a restriction in the overall capacity of visual working memory over time as a general explanation for the impaired global shape recognition in patients with simultanagnosia.",{},,The European journal of neuroscience,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06559.x,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",France,eng

Gerstmann's syndrome is a combination of disorientation for left and right, finger agnosia, and profound agraphia, alexia, and acalculia. It is due to a lesion in the left angular gyrus, situated at the confluence of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. We report on a patient who suffered from severe underdiagnosed eclampsia and who developed bilateral extensive medial temporal, parietal, and calcarine ischemic infarctions during an eclamptic fit. In addition, ischemia destroyed the left angular gyrus. The combination of these lesions led to Gerstmann's syndrome with additional cortical agnosia and cortical diplopia. For the first few months following the ischemic insult, the patient had been cortically blind. Thereafter, the patient slowly regained a visual acuity of 0.1 in both eyes. She then experienced monocular and binocular diplopia. Her ocular motility was normal; there was no phoria or tropia. Monocular and binocular diplopia slowly became less severe over the following year. Now, 2 years after the incident, the patient has a visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes and no double vision. However, the handicapping symptoms of Gerstmann's syndrome, which make leading a normal life impossible, have persisted--the patient still cannot cope alone, mainly due to the severe disorientation for left and right.

Here, we describe a 21-year-old right-handed woman with acute impairment in face recognition that selectively concerned unfamiliar faces, following a focal left lateral temporo-occipital venous infarct. She was severely impaired in discerning that unknown people seen in everyday life were unfamiliar, although she had no difficulty recognizing familiar people. Thus, she had no prosopagnosia, but abnormal 'hyperfamiliarity' for unknown faces. Her difficulty was not accompanied by delusions or deficits in discrimination, identification or memory for faces. Standard neuropsychological testing showed that her recognition of familiar faces was entirely normal. By contrast, her sense of personally knowing faces was severely impaired when unknown faces evoked weak signals of familiarity based on spurious cues, to the extent that she would misattribute fame to faces that were unknown but to which she had been incidentally exposed on a prior occasion. Priming experiments also revealed that, unlike normal subjects, she made familiarity judgements without accessing semantic identity representations. Moreover, in face recognition tests, she generally showed bias in that she relied more on right-hemisphere strategies to identify global traits and less on left-hemisphere processes compared with healthy subjects. This case provides novel evidence for a differential contribution of the two hemispheres to face recognition. Hyperfamiliarity for unknown faces might arise from an imbalance between reciprocal hemispheric functions in face recognition, with relative hypoactivation of left hemisphere processes but hyperactivation of right-hemisphere processes for retrieving stored associations about people, linking seen faces to representations of affective and personal relevance. Hence, abnormal bias in attributing some personal meaning to unknown faces could be evoked by spurious signals of familiarity based on irrelevant affective associations in the right hemisphere.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/awg086,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The current study examined how the processing of parts and their configurations may be affected in visual agnosia due to brain damage. Both a visual agnosic patient (AR) and healthy control subjects performed a visual search task in which they had to discriminate between targets and distractors that varied according to whether they shared their parts and/or their configuration. The results show that AR's visual search rates are disproportionally slow when targets and distractors share the same configuration than when they have different configurations. AR is also found to be disproportionately slow in discriminating targets and distractors that share identical parts when the targets and distractors share the same configuration. With differently configured targets and distractors, AR shows no part sharing effect. For controls, in contrast, the part and configuration sharing effects occur independently of one another. It is concluded that AR's object recognition deficit arises from difficulties in discriminating objects that share their configuration, and from an abnormal dependency of part information processing upon object configuration.",{},,Brain and cognition,,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

The extent to which DW's impairment has changed over time was evaluated using identical tests at time 1 (1988) and time 2 (2000). In particular, we assessed his ability to identify pictures and real objects, to draw from memory, and to access stored semantic information about living and non-living things. The principal findings were: (i). DW was significantly better at identifying real objects in comparison with line drawings. (ii). DW presented with a category-specific impairment for living things that remained consistent over the 12-year period. (iii). He significantly improved in his ability to identify real non-living objects over the 12-year period but real living objects remained at floor. (iv). His ability to access stored visual knowledge declined over time. On the basis of these data, we suggest that visual perception is required to maintain intact visual memories over a period of time. We also suggest that integrative visual agnosia co-occurs with a category-specific impairment for living things because the recognition of these items requires more global processing than for non-living things. In addition, we suggest that degradation to stored visual knowledge can cause category-specific naming impairments for living compared with non-living things because naming living things requires access to more detailed visual knowledge.",{},,Neurocase,10.1076/neur.8.5.466.16179,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

However, the way perceptual and memory processes cooperate when we navigate in our everyday life environment remains poorly understood. We studied a stroke patient presenting a brain lesion in the right PHC, which resulted in a mild and quantifiable topographic agnosia, and allowed us to investigate the role of this structure in overt place recognition. Photographs of personally familiar and unfamiliar places were displayed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Familiar places were either recognized or unrecognized by the patient and 6 age- and education-matched controls in a visual post-scan recognition test. In fMRI, recognized places were associated with a network comprising the fusiform gyrus in the intact side, but also the right anterior PHC, which included the lesion site. Moreover, this right PHC showed increased connectivity with the left homologous PHC in the intact hemisphere. By contrasting recognized with unrecognized familiar places, we replicate the finding of the joint involvement of the retrosplenial cortex, occipito-temporal areas, and posterior parietal cortex in place recognition. This study shows that the ability for left and right anterior PHC to communicate despite the neurological damage conditioned place recognition success in this patient. It further highlights a hemispheric asymmetry in this process, by showing the fundamental role of the right PHC in topographic agnosia.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '01', 'Day': '08'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,NeuroImage.

27756661,Prosopagnosia Induced by a Left Anterior Temporal lobectomy Following a Right Temporo-occipital Resection in a Multicentric Diffuse Low-Grade Glioma.,"Corrivetti, Francesco; Herbet, Guillaume; Moritz-Gasser, Sylvie; Duffau, Hugues",Corrivetti,"Face recognition is a complex function sustained by a distributed large-scale neural network, with a core system involving the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and the splenial commissural fibers. This circuit seems to be bilaterally organized, but with a right hemispheric dominance. According to this anatomic functional model, prosopagnosia is usually, but not exclusively, generated by a damage of the right part of this brain network. This report describes an original case of a multicentric diffuse low-grade glioma, with a right occipitotemporal tumor and a left anterior temporoinsular tumor. Awake surgery for the right occipitotemporal lesion, involving fusiform and inferior occipital gyri and ILF, was achieved in a first step without causing any neurologic deficit. A subsequent resection of the left anterior temporoinsular lesion, with removal of the anterior left ILF, was achieved 1 year later. Surprisingly, the patient experienced a strong and permanent prosopagnosia after this second surgery. The authors investigate the possible causes resulting in this prosopagnosia. Specifically, they suggest a decompensation within a reorganized neural network after the first operation, because of a disconnection syndrome induced by a bilateral surgical damage of the ventral occipitotemporal structural connectivity. These original data can be useful for neurosurgeons, especially when achieving resection for multicentric tumors involving both ventral streams, to inform patients before surgery about the possible risk of face recognition deficit, and to adapt the cognitive tasks intraoperatively during awake procedure.","DictElement({'Year': '2016', 'Month': '10', 'Day': '15'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2016,World neurosurgery,10.1016/j.wneu.2016.10.025,,Disconnection syndrome; Face recognition; Fusiform face area; Inferior longitudinal fascicle; Low-grade glioma; Prosopagnosia,Case Reports; Journal Article,United States,eng

Monkeys learned the task readily, but after bilateral removal of the banks and floor of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) they failed to perform the task efficiently. This result is consistent with the conclusion, based on recordings from single cells in awake, behaving monkeys [Perret et al., Physiological Aspects of Clinical Neuro-ophthalmology, Chapman & Hall, London, 1988] that this region of the temporal lobe is important for coding information about eye-gaze of a confronting animal. Human subjects were given identical stimuli in a task where they were asked to detect ""the face that is looking straight at you"". Human performance is sensitive to the degree of angular deviation from the frontal gaze position, being poorest at small angular deviations from 0 degrees. This was also true of monkeys viewing these stimuli, pre- and post-operatively. Compared with normal controls, two humans prosopagnosics were impaired at this task. However the extent of impairment was different in the two patients.

19334311,Structure and function in acquired prosopagnosia: lessons from a series of 10 patients with brain damage.,"Barton, Jason J S",Barton,"Acquired prosopagnosia varies in both behavioural manifestations and the location and extent of underlying lesions. We studied 10 patients with adult-onset lesions on a battery of face-processing tests. Using signal detection methods, we found that discriminative power for the familiarity of famous faces was most reduced by bilateral occipitotemporal lesions that involved the fusiform gyri, and better preserved with unilateral right-sided lesions. Tests of perception of facial structural configuration showed severe deficits with lesions that included the right fusiform gyrus, whether unilateral or bilateral. This deficit was most consistent for eye configuration, with some patients performing normally for mouth configuration. Patients with anterior temporal lesions had better configuration perception, though at least one patient showed a more subtle failure to integrate configural data from different facial regions. Facial imagery, an index of facial memories, was severely impaired by bilateral lesions that included the right anterior temporal lobe and marginally impaired by fusiform lesions alone; unilateral right fusiform lesions tended to spare imagery for facial features. These findings suggest that (I) prosopagnosia is more severe with bilateral than unilateral lesions, indicating a minor contribution of the left hemisphere to face recognition, (2) perception of facial configuration critically involves the right fusiform gyrus and (3) access to facial memories is most disrupted by bilateral lesions that also include the right anterior temporal lobe. This supports assertions that more apperceptive variants of prosopagnosia are linked to fusiform damage, whereas more associative variants are linked to anterior temporal damage. Next, we found that behavioural indices of covert recognition correlated with measures of overt familiarity, consistent with theories that covert behaviour emerges from the output of damaged neural networks, rather than alternative pathways. Finally, to probe the face specificity of the prosopagnosic defect, we tested recognition of fruits and vegetables: While face specificity was not found in most of our patients, the data of one patient suggested that this may be possible with more focal lesions of the right fusiform gyrus.",{},,Journal of neuropsychology,10.1348/174866407x214172,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

The patient revealed a normal P100 in visual evoked potentials both with colored and fine-grained achromatic checkerboards. But the amplitude of the P100 was clearly decreased if a coarse achromatic checkerboard was presented.The physiological and neuropsychological findings indicate that AM experienced problems integrating information over extended regions of space and in detecting second-order motion.

7833656,Functional segregation of color and motion processing in the human visual cortex: clinical evidence.,"Vaina, L M",Vaina,"Anatomical and physiological investigations indicate two major distinct functional streams within the extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey, and behavioral observations suggest that the ventral (occipitotemporal) pathway is the cornerstone for object recognition whereas the dorsal (occipitoparietal) pathway is primarily involved in visuospatial perception and visuomotor performance. In the context of this dichotomy we conducted a psychophysical and neuropsychological study of visual perceptual abilities in two stroke patients, each with lesions involving several extrastriate areas. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral lesions; in one patient (E.W.) the lesion involves the ventral medial portions of the occipital and temporal lobes, and in the other (A.F.) the lesion involves dorsally the occipital-parietal area, including the region of the temporal-parietal-occipital junction. E.W. suffers from achromatopsia of central origin, prosopagnosia, visual agnosia, and alexia without agraphia. His depth and motion perception, including recognition of moving objects, are normal. He has superior visual field loss bilaterally, and slightly impaired acuity, and complains that the world appears in a deep twilight even on a sunny day. In contrast, A.F. shows specific deficits of stereopsis, spatial localization, and several aspects of motion perception.

Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without tactile agnosia, i.e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognition.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/124.11.2287,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

This case also suggests that the coexistence of simultanagnosia and prosopagnosia results from a right hemispheric insult, and damage to the temporoparietal area interrupts the incorporation of spatial information into object recognition. This disconnection of information flow, together with impaired object recognition per se, may impair the parallel processing of multiple objects, leading to object-by-object or part-by-part recognition.","DictElement({'Year': '2015', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '24'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2015,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2015.1066827,,prosopagnosia for unfamiliar faces; prosopamnesia; simultanagnosia; spatial agraphia; superior temporal sulcus,Case Reports; Journal Article,England,eng

710146,Visual agnosia in an artist.,"Wapner, W; Judd, T; Gardner, H",Wapner,"This report describes a 73 year old left-handed male artist who presented with agnosic symptoms following an occipital cerebral vascular accident. Against a background of a memory disturbance, but otherwise essentially intact linguistic and cognitive capacities, the patient was generally unable to identify single objects on visual presentation, and displayed marked difficulty in interpreting complex objects, depicted scenes, and partially occluded figures. The patient's preserved ability to recognize geometric forms, to perceive optical illusions, and to copy designs, and objects with considerable accuracy suggested the clinical picture of visual agnosia. An examination was undertaken of the effects of this recognition disorder on the artist's capacity to draw. Despite an inability to recognize an object or scene, the patient retained various techniques (perspective, shadowing, designation of texture) which allowed him to copy the display in a veridical fashion. When displays were recognized, or when the patient was given only the name of the object and asked to draw it, he adopted a less slavish approach, characteristic of his pre-morbid artwork. While his post-morbid drawings bore a strong similarity to his earlier works, such features as insufficient differentiation of figure from ground, over-elaboration of detail, and areas of neglect revealed the debilitating effects of the recognition disorder. Moreover, an examination of the patient's strategies revealed numerous compensatory verbal and motor procedures which guided his drawing. Acknowledgments.

Although many investigators have claimed that distance estimates are normal or abnormal in some of these patients, many of these observations were made informally and the examiners often asked for relative, and not absolute, distance estimates. The present investigation served two purposes. First, we wanted to contrast the use of distance information in peripersonal space for perceptual report as opposed to visuomotor control in our visual form agnosic patient, DF. Second, we wanted to see to what extent her abilities to process distance cues were dependent on binocular vision, in light of Milner et al.'s (1991) observations of preserved stereopsis in DF, and Dijkerman et al.'s (1996) and Marotta et al.'s (1997) observations that her visual guidance of grasping may be particularly dependent on binocular vision of the target. We hypothesized that DF's visuomotor responses would show normal sensitivity to target distance, while her perceptual estimates would not. In the first experiment, we required DF and two age- and sex-matched control subjects to reach out and grasp black cubes placed at varying distances, or to estimate the distance of the cubes from the hand starting position without making a reaching movement. In the second experiment, we required DF and two age-matched control subjects to point as rapidly and accurately as possible to small LED targets which differed in spatial location, under binocular and monocular conditions. The results showed that, relative to the control subjects, DF's grasping movements produced normal peak velocity-distance scaling-when she reached for blocks which varied in depth or pointed to LED targets which were presented at different distances in depth. In contrast, in the cube experiment, her verbal estimates of object distance were poorly scaled, although they improved slightly under the binocular conditions. The results are discussed in terms of current theories of processing streams in extrastriate visual cortex and the distinction between categorical and coordinate spatial processing.",{},,Consciousness and cognition,10.1006/ccog.1998.0366,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",United States,eng

One source of evidence that has been used to shed light on this issue comes from the study of individuals who fail to integrate disparate parts of visual objects. This study reports a series of experiments that examine the ability of two such patients with this form of agnosia (integrative agnosia; IA), S.M. and C.R., to discriminate and categorize exemplars of a rich set of novel objects, ""Fribbles"", whose visual similarity (number of shared parts) and category membership (shared overall shape) can be manipulated. Both patients performed increasingly poorly as the number of parts required for differentiating one Fribble from another increased. Both patients were also impaired at determining when two Fribbles belonged in the same category, a process that relies on abstracting spatial relations between parts. C.R., the less impaired of the two, but not S.M., eventually learned to categorize the Fribbles but required substantially more training than normal perceivers. S.M.'s failure is not attributable to a problem in learning to use a label for identification nor is it obviously attributable to a visual memory deficit. Rather, the findings indicate that, although the patients may be able to represent a small number of parts independently, in order to represent multipart images, the parts need to be integrated or chunked into a coherent whole. It is this integrative process that is impaired in IA and appears to play a critical role in the normal object recognition of complex images.",{},,Cognitive neuropsychology,10.1080/02643290701672764,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

MC has extensive bilateral lesions to occipitotemporal cortex that include most early visual cortex and complete blindness in visual field perimetry testing with static targets. Nevertheless, she shows a remarkably robust preserved ability to perceive motion, enabling her to navigate through cluttered environments and perform actions like catching moving balls. Comparisons of MC's structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to a probabilistic atlas based on controls reveals that MC's lesions encompass the posterior, lateral, and ventral early visual cortex bilaterally (V1, V2, V3A/B, LO1/2, TO1/2, hV4 and VO1 in both hemispheres) as well as more extensive damage to right parietal (inferior parietal lobule) and left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VO1, PHC1/2). She shows some sparing of anterior occipital cortex, which may account for her ability to see moving targets beyond ~15 degrees eccentricity during perimetry. Most strikingly, functional and structural MRI revealed robust and reliable spared functionality of the middle temporal motion complex (MT+) bilaterally. Moreover, consistent with her preserved ability to discriminate motion direction in psychophysical testing, MC also shows direction-selective adaptation in MT+. A variety of tests did not enable us to discern whether input to MT+ was driven by her spared anterior occipital cortex or subcortical inputs. Nevertheless, MC shows rich motion perception despite profoundly impaired static and form vision, combined with clear preservation of activation in MT+, thus supporting the role of MT+ in the Riddoch phenomenon.","DictElement({'Year': '2018', 'Month': '05', 'Day': '09'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2018,Neuropsychologia,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.05.008,PMC6991136,Blindsight; FMRI; Middle temporal area (MT+); Motion perception; Riddoch phenomenon; Vision,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",England,eng

Moreover, it has been found that the defect in recognition and reproduction of rhythms was manifested regardless of the modality of perception, i.e. whether rhythm patterns were perceived by audition, vision, or touch. Therefore, the disturbance of rhythm abilities is supramodal in nature, based probably on the perception of time microintervals.

In addition, 1 patient showed a topographical disorientation and abnormalities of whole body movements. This patient came to post-mortem examination, which revealed bilateral and fairly symmetrical old and recent infarctions of the superior parietal lobules. In the light of these observations and previous reports, it is suggested that the reported abnormalities of whole body movements can be explained on the basis of a visuo-motor intrahemispheric disconnection due to the bilateral lesion of the dorsal parietal lobe. In addition, the global spatial disorientation is analysed and is thought to be the manifestation of a derangement of a specific function centered in the parietal lobe. Moreover, it is pointed out that topographic disorientation does not require the concomitant failure of oculomotor mechanisms for its production. The topography of the anatomical lesion is considered in relation to current concepts on brain damage after severe hypotension and cardiac arrest.

The broad pattern of results confirms that S.B., like the extensively tested patient D.F., shows an impressive array of preserved skills, despite his severe perceptual problems. Also like D.F., S.B. shows certain subtle visuomotor difficulties that can be related to the idea that his partially intact occipito-parietal areas are unable to benefit from interactions with the apparently severely damaged occipito-temporal regions. Unlike D.F., however, he is able to make accurate discriminations of simple visual features, such as object width and orientation, albeit with very slow response times. We hypothesize that several factors such as the early onset of S.B.'s lesion and the long period since his brain lesion have allowed his brain to compensate to a degree what has been impossible in D.F., whose brain damage occurred in adulthood. This may include an element of 'rewiring' and self-monitoring of visuomotor processes that allow S.B. to achieve perceptual access to visual information processed in the dorsal stream: information that is normally only available for on-line visuomotor control.",{},,Brain research.

Analysis of the stream of information from visual perception via semantics to phonology suggested incomplete access from vision to semantics as the source of errors. The disconnection did not affect verbo-visual matching, though he was unable to reject names that did not correspond to visual stimuli. Action naming was relatively spared, but naming of pictures of actions with objects was worse than naming of pictures of intransitive actions. Tactile naming worsened with simultaneous vision of objects. In visual object naming the error rate increased with increasing familiarity of objects. We propose that an interaction of excitation and inhibition within a single semantic system can explain the clinical phenomena of modality specific visual misnaming.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70509-4,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

EC demonstrated a complex neuropsychological picture including a massive visual agnosia and a complete lack of imagery, both of which involved all categories of objects (living and non living) and a category-specific word comprehension deficit limited to animal names. Findings are discussed in the light of the theoretical frameworks currently available in the area of neuropsychology. It is argued that neither the single nor the multiple view of semantics fully succeed in providing a satisfactory account of the data and a tentative interpretation of the whole pattern of impairment is proposed in the general framework of non abstractive conceptions of meaning.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70227-2,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Italy,eng

3208058,Prosopagnosia and agnosia for noncanonical views. An autopsied case.,"Landis, T; Regard, M; Bliestle, A; Kleihues, P",Landis,"It has been postulated that for prosopagnosia to occur, bilateral lesions of the central visual system are usually necessary. All but 1 of the 10 previously documented cases that came to autopsy showed this pattern. However, the long survival period after the onset of prosopagnosia in most of these patients limits the value of the autopsy findings for clinicopathological correlation. A patient is presented who died 10 days after she had developed prosopagnosia, topographagnosia and an agnosia for real objects seen from noncanonical views. These clinical symptoms corresponded directly to the autopsy finding of a recent large occipitotemporal ischaemic infarct in the territory of the right posterior cerebral artery. An additional right frontal infarct and a cortical microinfarct in a deep left lateral parieto-occipital sulcus were both old lesions and had passed unnoticed clinically. This first report of a direct clinicopathological correlation between a fresh right posterior lesion and prosopagnosia demonstrates that bilateral involvement of the visual system is not a prerequisite for prosopagnosia.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/111.6.1287,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

A PET study of sound categorization in a neurological patient and normal controls.,"Engelien, A; Silbersweig, D; Stern, E; Huber, W; Döring, W; Frith, C; Frackowiak, R S",Engelien,"H2(15)O-PET was used to investigate the functional anatomy of recovery in a patient (J.B.) with bilateral perisylvian strokes and auditory agnosia, who partially regained the ability to recognize environmental sounds, but remained clinically word-deaf. The patient and a group of six normal volunteers were scanned in the following three conditions: (i) passive listening to environmental sounds; (ii) categorization of environmental sounds; (iii) at rest. In normal subjects, passive listening as compared with rest was associated with significant activations in the auditory cortices and posterior thalami, and in the inferior parietal lobe and anterior insula/frontal opercular region on the right. In J.B., activations were observed in the spared auditory cortex and inferior parietal lobe of the right hemisphere and in regions adjacent to the perisylvian lesion in the left hemisphere (anterior insula/frontal opercular region, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobe). The recovered function, as measured by categorization of sounds compared with passive listening, in J.B. was associated with bilateral activation of a distributed network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices, as well as the right cerebellum and the right caudate nucleus. In addition, there was a left-sided activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus. In normal subjects, the same categorization task led to activation of a network comprising (pre)frontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal cortices in the left hemisphere only. These results suggest that bilateral activation (with recruitment of areas homologous to those known to be responsible for normal function), the engagement of peri-infarct regions, and the involvement of a more widespread neocortical network, are mechanisms of functional reorganization after injury that may enable recovery from, or compensation for, cognitive deficits.",{},,Brain : a journal of neurology,10.1093/brain/118.6.1395,,,"Case Reports; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
11076136,Effect of training frequency on face-name recall by adults with traumatic brain injury.,"Hux, K; Manasse, N; Wright, S; Snell, J",Hux,"Many TBI survivors have difficulty recalling the names of people with whom they frequently interact. Researchers have established that mnemonics and visual imagery strategies are often effective in facilitating encoding and recall of such information; however, no research exists pertaining to the frequency that such training should occur. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness of three frequencies of intervention sessions--once per day, two times per week, and five times per day--on TBI survivors' ability to recall face-name associations. Results showed that sessions held daily and twice a week were more effective than sessions held five times per day. Mnemonics and visual imagery strategies were effective for four of the seven participants, regardless of frequency of intervention sessions. Implications for treatment and future research are discussed.",{},,Brain injury,10.1080/026990500445727,,,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng
17228775,[Neuropsychological approach to visual attention].,"Suzuki, Kyoko",Suzuki,"Visual experience depends critically on visual attention, which selects a particular aspect of a visual display. Recent clinical, neuroimaging, and animal studies revealed that visual attention was divided into active and passive or top-down and bottom-up attention. Although these dichotomies are clear-cut in definition, visual attention could be modulated by many factors. Detailed observation of brain-injured patients provides with evidence for dynamic and fine control of visual attention. We observed patients with dorsal simultanagnosia and that with callosal disconnection syndrome. Patients with dorsal simultanagnosia demonstrated that extent of visual attention was dynamically changed depending on the level of visual processing. Despite the ability to read a kanji character and to describe its components correctly, a patient could not notice a component that he had just written and could not assemble individual components to make up a correct kanji character. He could point to an overlapping area of two figures. But once he started to color the overlapping area, he missed the margin of the area and colored much larger area. Another patient with dorsal simultanagnosia missed borderlines between columns of a newspaper and read letters continuously across columns. In contrast, he could point to lines between figures or meaningless patterns easily. These findings indicated that visual attention was directed automatically to meaningful characters. A patients with callosal disconnection syndrome demonstrated left unilateral spatial neglect only when he used his right hand to draw figures. Right hand movement, controlled by the left hemisphere, elicited visual attention to the right hemispace, resulting in the left unilateral spatial neglect. Thus visual attention is not simply top-down or bottom up, but is implicitly affected by the visual recognition as well as motor component of the task.",{},,No to shinkei = Brain and nerve,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,Japan,jpn
12507041,Pure topographical disorientation--the anatomical basis of landmark agnosia.,"Takahashi, Nobuyoshi; Kawamura, Mitsuru",Takahashi,"We used MRI studies of four patients to investigate the lesions responsible for landmark agnosia. A detailed investigation of the relationship between the symptoms and the lesions suggests that the right posterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus is critical for the acquisition of novel information about buildings and landscapes, and that the same region plus the anterior half of the lingual gyrus and the adjacent fusiform gyrus play an important role in the identification of familiar buildings and landscapes. Furthermore, the lesion responsible for prosopagnosia, which frequently occurs with landmark agnosia, seems to involve the posterior half of the lingual and fusiform gyri. This suggests that the lesions responsible for landmark agnosia and prosopagnosia are close to each other, but distinct.",{},,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70039-x,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Italy,eng

A 56-year-old woman presented with pure TD only in novel environments following limbic encephalitis. She could not remember directions inside the hospital on weekly outpatient visits; however, her verbal and visual anterograde memories were normal. In the test of learning photographs of scenes, faces, and objects, only her scores for landscapes were worse than those in healthy controls. These findings suggested that her TD specific to landscapes and directions in novel environments was caused by category-specific memory impairment related to bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal dysfunction.","DictElement({'Year': '2019', 'Month': '07', 'Day': '12'}, attributes={'DateType': 'Electronic'})",2019,Neurocase,10.1080/13554794.2019.1642359,,Topographical disorientation; directional disorientation; hippocampal gyrus; landmark agnosia; parahippocampal gyrus,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",England,eng

8777803,[A case of integrative visual agnosia].,"Hirayama, K; Iwasaki, S; Yamamoto, T; Suzuki, K; Kodama, N",Hirayama,"We report a 78-year-old right-handed man with integrative visual agnosia (Humphreys et al.) that was associated with bilateral medial occipito-temporal infarction. The patient showed superior altitudinal hemianopsia, alexia, prosopagnosia, cerebral achromatopsia, and object agnosia. Elementary perception and information processing supposed to be executed by the stream to the parietal lobe were intact, since he was able to perceive the position and speed of moving object (catching the flying ball). He could not categorize neither real objects nor line drawings by sight. However, copying and matching of them was accurate, suggesting that his agnosia was an associative type (Lissauer). Detailed neuropsychological examinations revealed that his agnosia was due to a disturbance in integrating local form features into a perceptual whole. In addition, this patient showed difficulty in retrieval of objects from memory. However, it is unlikely that this disturbance itself was a cause of this particular form of agnosia.",{},,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,,,,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,Japan,jpn

He did not have topographical agnosia or object agnosia. He regained the ability to recognize faces of familiar persons, whereas he remained unable to identify faces of persons whom he met after the disease onset. This case demonstrates that prosopagnosia may occur as a deficit of matching a perceived face to a memory store of the face, and that the failure to recognize unfamiliar faces may be due to the inability to form memory stores of new faces. These deficits can occur in association with a lesion confined to the right occipitotemporal region.",{},,Journal of neurology,10.1007/BF00919707,,,Case Reports; Journal Article,Germany,eng
